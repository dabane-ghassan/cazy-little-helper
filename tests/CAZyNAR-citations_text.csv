PMC2660063,Characterizing a model human gut microbiota composed of members of its two dominant bacterial phyla,False,"The adult human distal gut microbial community is typically dominated by 2 bacterial phyla (divisions), the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes. Little is known about the factors that govern the interactions between their members. Here, we examine the niches of representatives of both phyla in vivo. Finished genome sequences were generated from Eubacterium rectale and E. eligens, which belong to Clostridium Cluster XIVa, one of the most common gut Firmicute clades. Comparison of these and 25 other gut Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes indicated that the Firmicutes possess smaller genomes and a disproportionately smaller number of glycan-degrading enzymes. Germ-free mice were then colonized with E. rectale and/or a prominent human gut Bacteroidetes, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, followed by whole-genome transcriptional profiling, high-resolution proteomic analysis, and biochemical assays of microbial–microbial and microbial–host interactions. B. thetaiotaomicron adapts to E. rectale by up-regulating expression of a variety of polysaccharide utilization loci encoding numerous glycoside hydrolases, and by signaling the host to produce mucosal glycans that it, but not E. rectale, can access. E. rectale adapts to B. thetaiotaomicron by decreasing production of its glycan-degrading enzymes, increasing expression of selected amino acid and sugar transporters, and facilitating glycolysis by reducing levels of NADH, in part via generation of butyrate from acetate, which in turn is used by the gut epithelium. This simplified model of the human gut microbiota illustrates niche specialization and functional redundancy within members of its major bacterial phyla, and the importance of host glycans as a nutrient foundation that ensures ecosystem stability.The adult human gut houses a bacterial community containing trillions of members comprising thousands of species-level phylogenetic types (phylotypes). Culture-independent surveys of this community have revealed remarkable interpersonal variations in these strain- and species-level phylotypes. Two bacterial phyla, the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes, commonly dominate this ecosystem (1), as they do in the guts of at least 60 mammalian species (2).Comparative analysis of 5 previously sequenced human gut Bacteroidetes revealed that each genome contains a large repertoire of genes involved in acquisition and metabolism of polysaccharides. This repertoire includes (i) up to hundreds of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and polysaccharide lyases (PLs); (ii) myriad paralogs of SusC and SusD, outer membrane proteins involved in recognition and import of specific carbohydrate structures (3); and (iii) a large array of environmental sensors and regulators (4). These genes are assembled in similarly organized, selectively regulated polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that encode functions necessary to detect, bind, degrade and import carbohydrate species encountered in the gut habitat–either from the diet or from host glycans associated with mucus and the surfaces of epithelial cells (5–7). Studies of gnotobiotic mice colonized only with human gut-derived Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron have demonstrated that this organism can vary its pattern of expression of PULs as a function of diet, e.g., during the transition from mother's milk to a polysaccharide-rich chow consumed when mice are weaned (5), or when adult mice are switched from a diet rich in plant polysaccharides to a diet devoid of these glycans and replete with simple sugars (under the latter conditions, the organism forages on host glycans) (6, 7).Our previous functional genomic studies of the responses of B. thetaiotaomicron to cocolonization of the guts of gnotobiotic mice with Bifidobacterium longum, an Actinobacterium found in the intestines of adults and infants, or with Lactobacillus casei, a Firmicute present in a number of fermented diary products, have shown that B. thetaiotaomicron adapts to the presence of these other microbes by modifying expression of its PULs in ways that expand the breadth of its carbohydrate foraging activities (8).These observations support the notion that gut microbes may live at the intersection of 2 forms of selective pressure: bottom-up selection, where fierce competition between members of a community that approaches a population density of 1011 to 1012 organisms per milliliter of colonic contents drives phylotypes to assume distinct functional roles (niches); and top-down selection, where the host selects for functional redundancy to ensure against the failure of bioreactor functions that could prove highly deleterious (9, 10).The gene content, genomic arrangement and functional properties of PULs in sequenced gut Bacteroidetes illustrate the specialization and functional redundancy within members of this phylum. They also emphasize how the combined metabolic activities of members of the microbiota undoubtedly result in interactions that are both very dynamic and overwhelmingly complex (at least to the human observer), involving multiple potential pathways for the processing of substrates (including the order of substrate processing), varying patterns of physical partitioning of microbes relative to substrates within the ecosystem, plus various schemes for utilization of products of bacterial metabolism. Such a system likely provides multiple options for processing of a given metabolite, and for the types of bacteria that can be involved in these activities.All of this means that the task of defining the interactions of members of the human gut microbiota is daunting, as is the task of identifying general principles that govern the operation of this system. In the present study, we have taken a reductionist approach to begin to define interactions between members of the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes that are commonly represented in the human gut microbiota. In the human colon, Clostridium cluster XIVa is 1 of 2 abundantly represented clusters of Firmicutes. Therefore, we have generated the initial 2 complete genome sequences for members of the genus Eubacterium in Clostridium cluster XIVa (the human gut-derived E. rectale strain ATCC 33656 and E. eligens strain ATCC 27750) and compared them with the draft sequences of 25 other sequenced human gut bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes. The interactions between E. rectale and B. thetaiotaomicron were then characterized by performing whole-genome transcriptional profiling of each species after colonization of gnotobiotic mice with each organism alone, or in combination under 3 dietary conditions. Transcriptional data were verified by mass spectrometry of cecal proteins, plus biochemical assays of carbohydrate metabolism. Last, we examined colonization and interactions between these microbes from a host perspective; to do so, we performed whole-genome transcriptional analysis of colonic RNA prepared from mice that were germ-free or colonized with one or both species. Our results illustrate how members of the dominant gut bacterial phyla are able to adapt their substrate utilization in response to one another and to host dietary changes, and how host physiology can be affected by changes in microbiota composition.We produced finished genome sequences for Eubacterium rectale, which contains a single 3,449,685-bp chromosome encoding 3,627 predicted proteins, and Eubacterium eligens, which contains a 2,144,190-bp chromosome specifying 2,071 predicted proteins, plus 2 plasmids (Table S1). We also analyzed 25 recently sequenced gut genomes, including (i) 9 sequenced human gut-derived Bacteroidetes [includes the finished genomes of B. thetaiotaomicron, B. fragilis, B. vulgatus, and Parabacteroides distasonis, plus deep draft assemblies of the B. caccae, B. ovatus, B. uniformis, B. stercoris and P. merdae genomes generated as part of the human gut microbiome initiative (HGMI) (http://genome.wustl.edu/hgm/HGM_frontpage.cgi)], and (ii) 16 other human gut Firmicutes where deep draft assemblies were available through the HGMI (see Fig. S1 for a phylogenetic tree). We classified the predicted proteins in these 2 genomes using Gene Ontology (GO) terms generated via Interproscan, and according to the scheme incorporated into the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) database [www.cazy.org (11)], and then applied a binomial test to identify functional categories of genes that are either over- or under-represented between the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. This analysis, described in SI Results, Figs. S2 and S3, and Table S2 and Table S3, emphasized among other things that the Firmicutes, including E. rectale and E. eligens, have significantly fewer polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and more ABC transporters and PTS systems than the Bacteroidetes (12). We subsequently chose E. rectale and B. thetaiotaomicron as representatives of these 2 phyla for further characterization of their niches in vivo, because of their prominence in culture-independent surveys of the distal human gut microbiota (13, 14), the pattern of representation of carbohydrate active enzymes in their glycobiomes and E. rectale's ability to generate butyrate as a major end product of fermentation (15, 16). These choices set the stage for an “arranged marriage” between a Firmicute and a Bacteroidetes, hosted by formerly germ-free mice.Young adult male germ-free mice belonging to the NMRI inbred strain were colonized with B. thetaiotaomicron or E. rectale alone (monoassociations) or cocolonized with both species (biassociation). Ten to fourteen days after inoculation by gavage, both species colonized the ceca of recipient mice, fed a standard chow diet rich in complex plant polysaccharides, to high levels (n = 4–5 mice per treatment group in each of 3 independent experiments; Fig. S4A). Moreover, cecal levels of colonization for both organisms were not significantly different between mono- and biassociated animals (Fig. S4A).A custom, multispecies, human gut microbiome Affymetrix GeneChip was designed (SI Methods), and used to compare the transcriptional profile of each bacterial species when it was the sole inhabitant of the cecum, and when it coexisted together with the other species. A significant number of B. thetaiotaomicron genes located in PULs exhibited differences in their expression upon E. rectale colonization [55 of 106; P < 10−15 (cumulative hypergeometric test); see SI Methods for the statistical criteria for defining significantly different levels of gene expression]. Of these 55 genes, 51 (93%) were up-regulated (Fig. S4B; see Table S4A for a complete list of differentially regulated B. thetaiotaomicron genes).As noted in the Introduction, 2 previous studies from our lab examined changes in B. thetaiotaomicron's transcriptome in the ceca of monoassociated gnotobiotic mice when they were switched from a diet rich in plant polysaccharides to a glucose-sucrose chow (6), or in suckling mice consuming mother's milk as they transitioned to a standard chow diet (5). In both situations, in the absence of dietary plant polysaccharides, B. thetaiotaomicron adaptively forages on host glycans. The genes up-regulated in B. thetaiotaomicron upon cocolonization with E. rectale have a significant overlap with those noted in these 2 previous datasets (P < 10−14, cumulative hypergeometric test; Fig. S4C). In addition, they include several of the genes up-regulated during growth on minimal medium containing porcine mucosal glycans as the sole carbon source (7). For example, in cocolonized mice and in vitro, B. thetaiotaomicron up-regulates several genes (BT3787-BT3792; BT3774-BT3777) (Fig. S4D) used in degrading α-mannosidic linkages, a component of host N-glycans and the diet. (Note that E. rectale is unable to grow in defined medium containing α-mannan or mannose as the sole carbon sources; Table S3). B. thetaiotaomicron also up-regulates expression of its starch utilization system (Sus) PUL in the presence of E. rectale (BT3698–3704) (Fig. S4D). This well-characterized PUL is essential for degradation of starch molecules containing ≥6 glucose units (17).Thus, it appears that B. thetaiotaomicron adapts to the presence of E. rectale by up-regulating expression of a variety of PULs so that it can broaden its niche and degrade an increased variety of glycan substrates, including those derived from the host that E. rectale is unable to access. There are a number of reasons why the capacity to access host glycans likely represents an important trait underpinning microbiota function and stability: (i) glycans in the mucus gel are abundant and are a consistently represented source of nutrients; (ii) mucus could serve as a microhabitat for Bacteroidetes spp. to embed in (and adhere to via SusD paralogs), thereby avoiding washout from the ecosystem; and (iii) the products of polysaccharide digestion/fermentation generated by Bacteroidetes spp. could be shared with other members of the microbiota that are also embedded in mucus (7).E. rectale's response to B. thetaiotaomicron in the mouse cecum stands in marked contrast to B. thetaiotaomicron's response to E. rectale. Carbohydrate metabolism genes, particularly GHs, are significantly overrepresented among the E. rectale genes that are downregulated in the presence of B. thetaiotaomicron compared with monoassociation; i.e., 12 of E. rectale's predicted 51 GHs have significantly reduced expression while only 2 are up-regulated (Fig. S4 E and F; see Table S4B for a complete list of E. rectale genes regulated by the presence of B. thetaiotaomicron). The 2 up-regulated GH genes (EUBREC_1072, a 6-P-β-glucosidase and EUBREC_3687, a cellobiose phosphorylase) are predicted to break down cellobiose. Three simple sugar transport systems with predicted specificity for cellobiose, galactoside, and arabinose/lactose (EUBREC_3689, EUBREC_0479, and EUBREC_1075–6, respectively) are among the most strongly up-regulated genes (Fig. S4G and Table S4B). Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck EUBREC_2002) is also induced with cocolonization (Table S4B, GeneChip data were verified by qRT-PCR assays in 2 independent experiments involving 3–4 mice per treatment group; Fig. 1B). This enzyme catalyzes an energy conserving reaction that produces oxaloacetate from phosphoenolpyruvate. In a subsequent transaminase reaction, oxaloacetate can be converted to aspartate, linking this branching of the glycolytic pathway with amino acid biosynthesis (Fig. 1A).Summary of metabolic responses of E. rectale to B. thetaiotaomicron.

For example, a number of peptide and amino acid transporters in E. rectale are up-regulated, as are the central carbon and nitrogen regulatory genes CodY (EUBREC_1812), glutamate synthase (EUBREC_1829) and glutamine synthetase (EUBREC_2543) (Fig. 1B and Fig. S4H; note that these genes are also up-regulated during growth in tryptone glucose medium; Table S4C).E. rectale possesses genes (EUBEC733–737; EUBEC1017) for the production of butyrate that show high similarity to genes from other Clostridia. This pathway involves condensation of 2 molecules of acetylCoA to form butyrate and is accompanied by oxidation of NADH to NAD+ (Fig. 1). Transcriptional and high-resolution proteomic analyses (see below) disclosed that the enzymes involved in production of butyrate are among the most highly expressed in cecal contents recovered from mono- and biassociated mice containing E. rectale (Table S4B and Table S6A).In vitro studies have shown that in the presence of carbohydrates, E. rectale consumes large amounts of acetate for butyrate production (18). Several observations indicate that E. rectale utilizes B. thetaiotaomicron-derived acetate to generate increased amounts of butyrate in the ceca of our gnotobiotic mice. First, E. rectale up-regulates a phosphate acetyltransferase (EUBREC_1443; EC 2.3.1.8)—1 of 2 enzymes involved in the interconversion of acetyl-CoA and acetate (Fig. 1B). Second, cecal acetate levels are significantly lower in cocolonized mice compared with B. thetaiotaomicron monoassociated animals (Fig. 2). Third, although cecal butyrate levels are similar in E. rectale mono- and biassociated animals (Fig. 2), expression of mouse Mct-1, encoding a monocarboxylate transporter whose inducer and preferred substrate is butyrate (19), is significantly higher in the distal gut of mice containing both E. rectale and B. thetaiotaomicron versus E. rectale alone (P < 0.05; Fig. 2). The cecal concentrations of butyrate we observed are similar to those known to up-regulate Mct-1 in colonic epithelial cell lines (19). Higher levels of acetate (i.e., those encountered in B. thetaiotaomicron monoassociated mice) were insufficient to induce any change in Mct-1 expression compared with germ-free controls (Fig. 2).Cocolonization affects the efficiency of fermentation. Cecal contents from 4 mice in each treatment group were assayed for NAD+, NADH acetate, butyrate and proprionate levels. Expression of Mct-1 mRNA, a monocarboxylate transporter whose preferred substrate is butyrate was defined by qRT-PCR in the proximal colon. Cecal propionate concentrations. Mean values ± SEM are plotted; n = 4–5 mice per group; ∗, P < 0.05, ∗∗, P < 0.001 compared with cocolonization (Student's t test).The last step in E. rectale's butyrate production pathway is catalyzed by the butyrylCoA dehydrogenase/electron transfer flavoprotein (Bcd/Etf) complex (EUBREC_0735–0737; EC 1.3.99.2), and offers a recently discovered additional pathway for energy conservation, via a bifurcation of electrons from NADH to crotonylCoA and ferredoxin (20). Reduced ferredoxin, in turn, can be reoxidized via hydrogenases, or via the membrane-bound oxidoreductase, Rnf, which generates sodium-motive force (Fig. 1A). The up-regulation and high level of expression of these key metabolic genes when E. rectale encounters B. thetaiotomicron (Fig. 1B; Table S4B and Table S6A) indicates that E. rectale not only employs this pathway to generate energy, but to also accommodate the increased demand for NAD+ in the glycolytic pathway. Consistent with these observations, we found that the NAD+/NADH ratio in cecal contents was significantly increased with cocolonization (Fig. 2).The pathway for acetate metabolism observed in this simplified model human gut community composed of B. thetaiotaomicron and E. rectale differs markedly from what is seen in mice that harbor B. thetaiotaomicron and the principal human gut methanogenic archaeon, Methanobrevibacter smithii. When B. thetaiotaomicron encounters M. smithii in the ceca of gnotobiotic mice, there is increased production of acetate by B. thetaiotaomicron, no diversion to butyrate and no induction of Mct-1 (21), increased serum acetate levels, and increased adiposity compared with B. thetaiotaomicron mono-associated controls. In contrast, serum acetate levels and host adiposity (as measured by fat pad to body weight ratios) are not significantly different between B. thetaiotaomicron monoassociated and B. thetaiotaomicron-E. rectale cocolonized animals (n = 4–5 animals/group; n = 3 independent experiments; data not shown).We subsequently used Affymetrix Mouse 430 2 GeneChips to compare patterns of gene expression in the proximal colons of mice that were either germ-free, monoassociated with E.rectale or B. thetaiotaomicron, or cocolonized with both organisms (n = 4 mice per group; total of 16 GeneChip datasets). In contrast to the small number of genes whose expression was significantly changed (≥1.5-fold, FDR <1%) after colonization with either bacterium alone relative to germ-free controls (Table S7 A and B), cocolonization produced significant alterations in the expression of 508 host genes (Table S7C). Expression of many of these genes also changed with monoassociation with either organism, and in the same direction as seen after cocolonization, but in most cases the changes evoked by B. thetaiotaomicron or E. rectale alone did not achieve statistical significance. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of average expression intensity values derived from each of the 4 sets of GeneChips/group, revealed that the E.rectale monoassociation and E.rectale-B.thetaiotaomicron biassociation profiles clustered separate from the germ-free and B. thetaiotaomicron monoassociation datasets (Fig. S5).Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (www.ingenuity.com) disclosed that the list of 508 host genes affected by cocolonization was significantly enriched in functions related to cellular growth and proliferation (112 genes; Table S8A), and cell death (130 genes) (Table S8B). A number of components of the canonical wnt/β catenin pathway, which is known to be critically involved in controlling self-renewal of the colonic epithelium, were present in this list (Akt3, Axin2, Csnk1D, Dkk3, FrzB, Fzd2, Gja1, Mdm2, Ppp2r5e, Sfrp2, Tgfb3, Tgfbr1, and Tgfbr2). Many of the changes observed in biassociated mice are likely to be related to the increased influx of butyrate, generated by E. rectale, into colonic cells (Fig. 1A). Butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor that evokes pronounced transcriptional changes in different types of cultured epithelial cell lines (22–25), is the preferred energy substrate for colonic enterocytes (26). While transcriptional changes caused by butyrate differ depending upon the cell lineage, state of cellular differentiation, and cellular energy status (23, 24, 27, 28), in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that it affects expression of genes involved in proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (25, 28).As mentioned above, as part of its adaptation to the presence of E. rectale, B. thetaiotaomicron up-regulates a number of genes involved in the harvest of host glycans. Included among these B. thetaiotaomicron genes are components of a fucose utilization operon linked to production of a bacterial signal that induces synthesis of intestinal mucosal fucosylated glycans, and microbial catabolism of fucose from O-glycans (29). GeneChip profiling of colonic gene expression disclosed that cocolonization results in increased expression of Fut2 (α-1,2 fucosyltransferase), Fut4 (α-1,3-fucosyltransferase), plus 10 other genes involved in the synthesis of mucosal glycans (glycosphingolipids and O-glycans) (Table S8C). Thus, by increasing host production of glycans, B. thetaiotaomicron can benefit itself, and through its metabolic products, E. rectale.In a final series of experiments, we assessed how E. rectale and B. thetaiotaomicron were affected by changes in host diet. Groups of age- and gender-matched cocolonized mice were fed 1 of 3 diets that varied primarily in their carbohydrate and fat content: (i) the standard low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet used for the experiments described above (abbreviated “LF/PP” for low-fat/plant polysaccharide), (ii) a high-fat, “high-sugar” Western-type diet (abbreviated HF/HS) that contained sucrose, maltodextrin, and corn starch, plus complex polysaccharides (primarily cellulose) that were not digestible by B. thetaiotaomicron or E. rectale, and (iii) a control diet that was similar to (ii) except that the fat content was 4-fold lower (“LF/HS” for low-fat, high-sugar; n = 5 mice per group). Whereas B. thetaiotaomicron's colonization levels were similar in all 3 diets, colonization of E. rectale was significantly reduced (5-fold) in mice fed either the LF/HS or HF/HS diets (P < 0.01, heteroscedastic t test).Whole-genome transcriptional profiling of both bacterial species showed that relative to the standard polysaccharide-rich chow diet (LF/PP), both the Western style HF/HS diet and its LF/HS control produced a significant up-regulation of B. thetaiotaomicron PULs involved in harvesting and degrading host polysaccharides, and a downregulation of several PULs involved in the degradation of dietary plant polysaccharides (Fig. S6A). E. rectale's response to the HF/HS and LF/HS diets was to down-regulate several of its GHs and a number of its sugar transporters (Fig. S6B). Moreover, levels of butyrate were 5-fold lower in cocolonized mice fed these compared with the standard chow (LF/PS) diet [0.496 ± 0.0051 μmol per gram of wet weight cecal contents; (LF/PP) vs. 0.095 ± 0.002 (HF/HS) vs. 0.080 ± 0.008 (LF/HS) (P < 0.05 ANOVA)].These dietary manipulations lend further support to the view that B. thetaiotaomicron with its large repertoire of PUL-associated GHs functions in this model 2-member human microbiota to process complex dietary plant polysaccharides and to distribute to the products of digestion to E. rectale, which, in turn, synthesizes butyrate. The reduced colonization response of E. rectale to the HF/HS and LF/HS diets can be explained by a number of factors: (i) this Firmicute does not have predicted GHs and PLs that can process host glycans (Fig. S3); (ii) it cannot use most of the sugars we tested that are derived from mucosal polysaccharides (Table S3); and (iii) the host possesses enzymes in its glycobiome that can directly process the simple sugars present in these 2 diets. Indeed, human subjects that are fed diets deficient in complex polysaccharides harbor lower levels of butyrate-producing gut bacteria, including members of the E. rectale-containing clade (30). Our simplified gnotobiotic model of the microbiota underscores the functional implications of diet-associated changes in the representation of this clade, not only as they relate to the operations of the microbiota itself but also potentially as they relate to butyrate-mediated changes in gut epithelial homeostasis.Model communities such as the one described above, constructed in gnotobiotic mice, where microbiome gene content is precisely known and transcriptional data are obtained under conditions where potentially confounding host variables such as diet and host genotype can be constrained, provide a way to test the efficacy of high-resolution mass spectrometric methods for characterizing gut microbial community proteomes. Therefore, we assayed the proteins present in luminal contents, collected from the ceca of 8 gnotobiotic mice fed the standard polysaccharide-rich LF/PP diet (germ-free, monoassociated, and cocolonized; n = 2 mice per treatment group representing 2 independent biological experiments; see SI Methods for additional details).The measured proteomes had high reproducibility in terms of total number of proteins observed and spectra matching to each species. Table S5 and SI Results provide a summary of our analyses, including the percentage of mRNAs called “Present” in the GeneChip datasets for which there was an identified protein product. The most abundant identified products from both microbes included ribosomal proteins, elongation factors, chaperones, and proteins involved in energy metabolism (for a full list of identified proteins, see Table S6; note that Table S4 A and B, which list differentially expressed genes in monoassociation versus biassociation experiments, also indicate whether protein products from their transcripts were identified in these mass spectrometry datasets). Many conserved hypothetical and pure hypothetical proteins were identified, as were proteins encoded by 10 genes in B. thetaiotaomicron whose presence had not been predicted in our initial annotation of the finished genome (Table S6A). Together, the results provide validation of experimental and computational procedures used for proteomic assays of a model gut microbiota, and illustrate some of the benefits in obtaining this type of information.These studies of a model 2-member human gut microbiota created in gnotobiotic mice support a view of the Bacteroidetes, whose genomes contain a disproportionately large number of glycan-degrading enzymes compared with sequenced Firmicutes, as responding to increasing microbial diversity in the distal intestine by modulating expression of their vast array of polysaccharide utilization loci. B. thetaiotaomicron adapts to the presence of E. rectale by up-regulating a variety of loci specific for host-derived mucin glycans that E. rectale is unable to use. E. rectale, which like other Firmicutes has a more specialized capacity for glycan degradation, broadly downregulates its available GHs in the presence of B. thetaiotaomicron, even though it does not grow efficiently in the absence of carbohydrates. It also becomes more selective in its harvest of sugars and its transcriptional profile suggests improved access to other nutrients (e.g., there is a generalized up-regulation of amino acid biosynthetic genes and a set of nutrient transporters that can harvest peptides). Thus, this simplified, model microbial community illustrates some of the basic ecologic principles that likely shape the operations of the human gut microbiota: nutrient interchange and the observed reciprocal effects on metabolism of these 2 organisms provide examples of classic syntrophy while “character displacement”, where cooccurrence drives (niche) divergence, also operates.We have previously used gnotobiotic mice to show that the efficiency of fermentation of dietary polysaccharides to short chain fatty acids by B. thetaiotaomicron increases in the presence of M. smithii (21). Cocolonization increases the density of colonization of the distal gut by both organisms, increases production of formate and acetate by B. thetaiotaomicron and allows M. smithii to use H2 and formate to produce methane, thereby preventing the build-up of these fermentation end-products (and NADH) in the gut bioreactor, and improving the efficiency of carbohydrate metabolism (21). Removal of H2 by this methanogenic archaeon allows B. thetaiotaomicron to regenerate NAD+, which can then be used for glycolysis. This situation constitutes a mutualism, in which both members show a clear benefit. The present study, characterizing the cocolonization with B. thetaiotaomicron and E. rectale, describes a more nuanced interaction where both species colonize to similar levels if carbohydrate substrates are readily available. Moreover, certain aspects of bacterial-host mutualism become more apparent with cocolonization, including increased microbial production and host transport of butyrate, and increased host production and microbial consumption of mucosal glycans.It seems likely that as the complexity of the gut community increases, interactions between B. thetaiotaomicron and E. rectale will either by subsumed or magnified by other “similar” phylogenetic types (as defined by their 16S rRNA sequence and/or by their glycobiomes). Synthesizing model human gut microbiotas of increasing complexity in gnotobiotic mice using sequenced members should be very useful for further testing this idea, as well as a variety of ecologic concepts and principles that may operate to influence the assembly and dynamic operations of our gut microbial communities.All nucleotide sequences from all contigs of completed genome assemblies containing both capillary sequencing and pyrosequencer data, produced as part of the HGMI, were downloaded from the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center's website (http://genome.wustl.edu/pub/organism/Microbes/Human_Gut_Microbiome) on September 27, 2007. The finished genome sequences of B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC 8482, and B. fragilis NCTC9343 were obtained from GenBank.For comparison purposes, protein-coding genes were identified in all genomes using YACOP (32). Each proteome was assigned InterPro numbers and GO terms using InterProScan release 16.1. Statistical comparisons between genomes were carried out as described in ref. 4, using perl scripts that are available upon request from the authors.Previously described methods were used to isolate RNA from a 100- to 300-mg aliquot of frozen cecal contents, synthesize cDNA, and to biotinylate and hybridize the cDNAs to a custom bacterial GeneChip (21). The only modification was that in RNA isolation protocol, 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products) were used for lysis of bacterial cells in a bead beater (Biospec; 4-min run at highest speed). Genes in a given bacterial species that were differentially expressed in mono- versus biassociation experiments were identified using CyberT (default parameters) after probe masking and scaling with the MAS5 algorithm (Affymetrix; for details about the methods used to create the mask, see the Methods section of SI Text).RNA was purified from proximal colon using Mini RNeasy kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion. Biotinylated cRNA targets were prepared from each sample (n = 4 per treatment group). cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome Mo430 2 GeneChips, and the resulting datasets analyzed using Probe Logarithmic Error Intensity Estimate method (PLIER + 16). Fold-changes and p-values were calculated using Cyber-t.

PMC2686590,The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy): an expert resource for Glycogenomics,False,"The Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme (CAZy) database is a knowledge-based resource specialized in the enzymes that build and breakdown complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates. As of September 2008, the database describes the present knowledge on 113 glycoside hydrolase, 91 glycosyltransferase, 19 polysaccharide lyase, 15 carbohydrate esterase and 52 carbohydrate-binding module families. These families are created based on experimentally characterized proteins and are populated by sequences from public databases with significant similarity. Protein biochemical information is continuously curated based on the available literature and structural information. Over 6400 proteins have assigned EC numbers and 700 proteins have a PDB structure. The classification (i) reflects the structural features of these enzymes better than their sole substrate specificity, (ii) helps to reveal the evolutionary relationships between these enzymes and (iii) provides a convenient framework to understand mechanistic properties. This resource has been available for over 10 years to the scientific community, contributing to information dissemination and providing a transversal nomenclature to glycobiologists. More recently, this resource has been used to improve the quality of functional predictions of a number genome projects by providing expert annotation. The CAZy resource resides at URL: http://www.cazy.org/.Due to the extreme variety of monosaccharide structures, to the variety intersugar linkages and to the fact that virtually all types of molecules can be glycosylated (from sugars themselves, to proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, antibiotics, etc.), the large variety of enzymes acting on these glycoconjugates, oligo- and polysaccharides probably constitute one of the most structurally diverse set of substrates on Earth. Collectively designated as Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZymes), these enzymes build and breakdown complex carbohydrates and glycoconjugates for a large body of biological roles (collectively studied under the term of Glycobiology). Therefore, CAZymes have to perform their function usually with high specificity. Because carbohydrate diversity (1) exceeds by far the number of protein folds, CAZymes have evolved from a limited number of progenitors by acquiring novel specificities at substrate and product level. Such a dizzying array of substrates and enzymes makes CAZymes a particularly challenging subject for experimental characterization and for functional annotation in genomes.Nearly 20 years ago, the first foundation for a family classification of CAZymes was seen in an effort that classified cellulases into several distinct families based on amino-acid sequence similarity (2). Soon after, the family classification system based on protein sequence and structure similarities, was extended to all known glycoside hydrolases (2–4), and subsequently extended to all CAZymes involved in the synthesis, degradation and modification of glycoconjugates. The classification of CAZymes has been made available on the web since September 1998. Because based on amino-acid sequence similarities, these classifications correlate with enzyme mechanisms and protein fold more than enzyme specificity. Consequently, these families are used to conservatively classify proteins of uncharacterized function whose only known feature is sequence similarity to an experimentally characterized enzyme, avoiding overprediction of enzyme activities.At present, CAZy covers approximately 300 protein families in the following classes of enzyme activities:
Glycoside hydrolases (GHs), including glycosidases and transglycosidases (3–5). These enzymes constitute 113 protein families that are responsible for the hydrolysis and/or transglycosylation of glycosidic bonds. GH-coding genes are abundant and present in the vast majority of genomes corresponding to almost half—presently about 47%—of the enzymes classified in CAZy. Because of their widespread importance for biotechnological and biomedical applications, GHs constitute so far the best biochemically characterized set of enzymes present in the CAZy database.Glycosyltransferases (GTs). These are the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of glycosidic bonds from phospho-activated sugar donors (6–8). They form over 90 sequence-based families and present in virtually every single organism and represent about 41% of CAZy at present.Polysaccharide lyases (PLs) cleave the glycosidic bonds of uronic acid-containing polysaccharides by a β-elimination mechanism (6). They are presently found in 19 families in CAZy (7), corresponding to only about 1.5% of CAZy content. Many PLs have biotechnological and biomedical applications and, despite their small overall number, they are among the CAZymes with the highest proportion of biochemically characterized examples present in the database.Carbohydrate esterases (CEs). They remove ester-based modifications present in mono-, oligo- and polysaccharides and thereby facilitate the action of GHs on complex polysaccharides. Presently described in 15 families (7), CEs represent roughly 5% of CAZy entries. As the specificity barrier between carbohydrate esterases and other esterase activities is low, it is likely that the sequence-based classification incorporates some enzymes that may act on non-carbohydrate esters.Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). These are autonomously folding and functioning protein fragments that have no enzymatic activity per se but are known to potentiate the activity of many enzyme activities described above by targeting to and promoting a prolonged interaction with the substrate. CBMs are most often associated to the other carbohydrate-active enzyme catalytic modules in the same polypeptide and can target different substrate forms depending on different structural characteristics (9,10). However, occasionally they can be present in isolated or tandem forms not coupled with an enzyme. Roughly 7% of CAZy entries contain at least one CBM module. CBMs are presently classified in 52 families in CAZy (7).
In addition to protein families that are well curated by the CAZy database, CAZymes are known to contain domains not acting on carbohydrates, including other enzymes—such as proteases, myosin motors or phosphatases, etc.—and a variety of protein–protein or protein–cell wall binding domains—cohesins, SLHs, TPR, etc.The CAZy family classification system covers all taxonomic groups, and provides the ground for common nomenclature for CAZymes across different glycobiologists (11,12) generally specialized only in some specific groups of organisms. Day-to-day inspection of new enzyme characterizations reported in the literature regularly led and continues to lead to the definition of new enzyme families. Significantly, the CAZy families, originally created following hydrophobic cluster analysis in the 1990s from very limited number of sequences available (2–6) and later complemented by BLAST- and HMMer-based sequence similarity approaches, are globally surviving the challenge of time in spite of a hundred-fold increase in the number of sequences.The CAZy database contains information from (i) sequence annotations from publicly available sources, namely the NCBI, including taxonomical, sequence and reference information, (ii) family classification and (iii) known functional information. This data allow the exploration of an enzyme (CAZyme), all CAZymes in an organism or a CAZy protein family. The addition of new family members and the incorporation of biochemical information extracted from the literature are updated regularly, following careful inspection. Newly released three-dimensional (3D) structures and genomes are analyzed as they are released by public databases. Daily update releases from GenBank form the bulk of sequence additions to the database (8) are complemented by weekly PDB releases (13). Presently only genome released through these GenBank releases are analyzed regularly, whereas other genomes protein predictions are analyzed upon request as part of collaborative efforts (vide infra).Another feature of CAZy is that the number of families, the family-associated information and content are continuously updated. When new families are created, old previously released genomes and sequence in public databases are reanalyzed to take the additional new family into account to ensure completeness in sequence description. Internally, curators include and maintain all referenced biochemical and other characterization data from the literature and the analysis of full sets of protein sequences present in a single genome. Because of this continuous effort of data addition, new families are frequently added and reflect the advances in experimental characterization of CAZymes. New families are exclusively created based on the availability of at least one biochemically-characterized member for which a sequence is available and the information published in peer-reviewed scientific literature. This sequence then serves as a seed for the family that is gradually extended with sequences that share statistically significant similarity.Only functional assignments based on experimental data are included in the CAZy database by the association of EC numbers to protein sequences. Therefore inferred functional assignments are not included. Experimental data are ideally a direct enzyme analysis, but also could include indirect evidence such as gene knockout experiments with extensive characterization. Because there is a shortage of EC numbers, relative to the number of functions characterized experimentally, some incomplete EC numbers such as 3.2.1.-, 2.4.1.-, 2.4.2.- and 2.4.99.- are also included in the database. In addition, as the described functions in CAZy are only of enzymatic nature, additional and complementary binding and inhibitory functions known to be associated with several CAZy proteins will be curated and explored in the near future.Carbohydrate-active enzymes, can exhibit a modular structure (Figure 1), where a module can be defined as a structural and functional unit (7,14). Each family in CAZy is dependent on the definition of a common segment in each full sequence that ultimately contains the catalytic or binding module. The definition of the limits within the sequence of the composing modules depends on available information derived from a combination of different approaches:
protein 3D structures,reported deletion studies andprotein-sequence analysis and comparisons.
Different sequence comparison tools are used to define enzyme families, particularly gapped BLAST (9) and HMMER (10) using hidden markov models (HMMs) made from each family. All the sequences corresponding to the catalytic and binding of carbohydrate-active enzymes are excised from the full protein sequence and grouped in a BLAST library. Positive hits against this ‘high quality’ library, are entered into the database by trained curators following manual check on a daily basis with a small number of sequences with high identity (>85%) ungapped alignments to previously examined sequences being entered automatically.

Modular annotation has been in fact applied to genome data released by the NCBI, with over 750 genomes analyzed. Approximately 1–3% of the proteins encoded by a typical genome correspond to CAZymes (10,11). In addition to publicly released sequences, annotation of proteins in recently sequenced genomes prior to full release are regularly performed by the CAZy team in collaboration with scientists from all over the globe.All too often, functional annotation methods employed during whole genome annotation are erroneous and lack consistent language (12,15). While sequence similarity to genes annotated by GO or best BLAST hits can be a good-starting point to assignment to pathways or possible general functions, such as serine/theonine kinase, many automatic functional assignments are unfortunately much more specific. This is particularly true in the case of CAZymes, since related families of the latter group together enzymes of widely differing specificity.The CAZy database employs practices that aim to eliminate the problems with automatic annotation. Biochemical characterization of new proteins from the literature is used to create new protein families, to annotate their referring entries and to update family descriptions (6). These biochemical assignments are also employed to help the manual curator estimate the likely general functions and add descriptions that indicate which enzymatically characterized proteins are related to new sequences. Inclusion of reference data compiled by communities centered on model organisms is considered for the future. Bibliographic references are included in CAZy by a specific layer that includes over 16 000 different bibliographic references. These references were extracted automatically from individual accessions using ProFal (16) and about one-third was entered manually.When functional predictions are made, they arise from manual curation by examination of closely related sequences and when biochemical information is not available, such as the case for many genome projects, very general functional tags are used to convey general functions of a family. Recently, we have begun further breaking down families into subfamilies in the hope of grouping proteins by specificity using sequence similarity. This would allow us to give more insights into possible functions. This new classification can also give insights into conserved active sites and active site specificity, when comparing biochemically characterized enzymes. Currently subfamily assignments are available publicly only for GH13 (14), GH1, GH2 and GH5 (released with this publication). This effort will be continued in the future with many more subfamilies being incorporated into the CAZy knowledge base in the future. Subfamilies identify subgroups of sequences that are more homogeneous in their functional properties. Most identified subfamilies are monospecific. If polyspecific, the functional variability is low and typically limited to two or three EC activities. There, often the known subfamily functions often share a substrate or product. Furthermore, rational enzyme engineering may be used to switch the functions for several cases (data not shown). Subfamilies also open the door for further enzymatic characterization—a few subfamilies as still no known activity—or for the identification of meaningful targets for structural characterization.Internal CAZy tools, such as our semi-automatic modular assignment presently allow the analysis of a larger number of sequences than a few years ago, making it possible to perform large-scale analyses, such as the annotation of CAZyme systems in genomes and metagenomic investigations of the breakdown of complex carbohydrates. A typical genome analysis begins with the assignment of protein models to one or several CAZy families (depending on the number of CAZy modules present within the sequence). This family assignment is then followed by the prediction of general functional classes using a manual examination of alignments to closely related sequences, taking care to identify the retention of active-site residues. Once a genome is categorized by family and functional classes, gene content analysis is utilized to give insights into how newly sequenced organisms might be similar or different from closely related species. Differences in genome content, i.e. relative family size, might reflect the relative diversity or complexity of the inherent biological processes (17) and therefore, the biology of the compared species. For example, differences suggesting a more pronounced pectin metabolism in ‘dicot’ Arabidopsis versus ‘monocot’ rice have been noted (17) as well as expected differences in cell-wall metabolism between short-lived annual Arabidopsis versus long-lived poplar tree have been suggested (18). With the advent of a variety of post-genomic techniques, a new vision of the CAZymes as significant components of carbohydrate-based systems now emerges. Examples include: N- and O-glycosylation of proteins, starch metabolism, biosynthesis of the cell-wall and its subcomponents. Geisler-Lee et al. (19) have combined bioinformatics and transcriptome analysis of various poplar and Arabidopsis tissues and organs and have shown that CAZyme transcripts are particularly abundant in wood tissues.In addition to a website facelift, the new CAZy website comes with a host of new features. Primarily, we are now offering users the ability to search the CAZy site for information by GenBank protein accession number, family or organism rather than navigate long static pages as prior to 12/31/2008 (Figure 2). To the new site we are also including, pages to describe new releases, new genomes and other new features. In addition, tools developed in the lab are available for interactive use.
(A) Once a search is performed, such as for a protein accession ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P00275"",""term_id"":""135741"",""term_text"":""P00275""}}P00275), the resulting page indicates the modular families that compose that protein. (B) Upon clicking the resulting links provided in A, users are directed to a page about the family and gives a listing of all annotated members.The CAZy database is a fluid database always changing and growing as additional data becomes available. In the last 2 years, the number of sequences in CAZY has nearly doubled and the number of available genomes is over 750. We believe this trend will continue in the coming years. Unfortunately, while sequencing is forever more rapid, progress in structural information and biochemical characterization is much slower. The number of biochemical data has grown only by 8% over the last 2 years (Figure 3). This means that the gap is widening between available sequences and biochemically characterized enzymes, making better methods for high-throughput biochemical characterization advantageous.
The number of protein containing CAZy modules were noted in December of the years 1999–2007. Within this set (Open circle), the number of enzymatically characterized proteins (triangle) and those with solved structures (open diamond) were also counted. In December 2007, <10% of proteins in CAZy were characterized enzymatically and <1% had a solved structure. In 8 years, the number of sequences has increased 14-fold, while the number of enzymatic and structural characterization has mearly doubled. Therefore, the porportion of proteins with functional and stuctural information is decreasing rapidly unless high throughput functional efforts are made in this category of enzymes.As started previously, we are actively pursuing the classification of subfamilies within each family. This further level of classification is important for instance to identify key residues or motifs important to define specificity. Finally, we hope to offer soon a page to submit sequences for a sequence similarity search and keyword search on our website.The CAZy database is available at www.cazy.org.

PMC2694162,Bioprospecting metagenomes: glycosyl hydrolases for converting biomass,False,"Throughout immeasurable time, microorganisms evolved and accumulated remarkable physiological and functional heterogeneity, and now constitute the major reserve for genetic diversity on earth. Using metagenomics, namely genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples, this biogenetic diversification can be accessed without the need to cultivate cells. Accordingly, microbial communities and their metagenomes, isolated from biotopes with high turnover rates of recalcitrant biomass, such as lignocellulosic plant cell walls, have become a major resource for bioprospecting; furthermore, this material is a major asset in the search for new biocatalytics (enzymes) for various industrial processes, including the production of biofuels from plant feedstocks. However, despite the contributions from metagenomics technologies consequent upon the discovery of novel enzymes, this relatively new enterprise requires major improvements. In this review, we compare function-based metagenome screening and sequence-based metagenome data mining, discussing the advantages and limitations of both methods. We also describe the unusual enzymes discovered via metagenomics approaches, and discuss the future prospects for metagenome technologies.In recent years, biofuels have attracted great interest as an alternative, renewable source of energy in the face of the ongoing depletion of fossil fuels, our energy dependence on them, and our growing environmental awareness of the critical consequences of burning such fuels. Plant biomass, the most abundant biopolymer on earth, has long been recognized as a potential sustainable source of mixed sugars for biofuel production. However, breakthrough technologies are still needed to overcome the several barriers to developing cost-effective processes for converting biomass to fuels and chemicals [1]. As yet, we have an incomplete understanding of the plant cell wall and its deconstruction and conversion; considerable research will be needed to better appreciate the fundamental and applied aspects of enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial hydrolysis and/or fermentation of plant cell walls.Estimates suggest that approximately 4–6 × 1030 prokaryotes inhabit the earth [2]. Being the oldest life form, prokaryotic microorganisms have evolved and accumulated remarkable physiological and functional diversity, thereby constituting the world's major reserve of genetic diversity. Traditional methods to tap this information are by cultivating the microorganisms, subsequently screening individual ones for the requisite phenotypes. However, about 95% to 99.9% of microorganisms have not been cultured by standard laboratory techniques [3]. One way to overcome this limitation is by improving cultivation-based methodologies [4,5].As a cultivation independent approach, Pace and colleagues [6] proposed a way to isolate directly the collective genomes from all microorganisms in a given habitat, and, in 1991, Schmidt et al. [7] undertook the first metagenome-based community characterization on amplified 16S rRNA genes. The subsequent improvement of sequencing technologies made feasible the metagenome shot-gun sequencing of environmental samples; however, most environmental communities are far too complex to be fully sequenced in this manner. Initial attempts were made to reconstruct the metagenomes of viral communities in the ocean and human feces [8-10], and subsequently of samples from the Sargasso Sea [11] and a biofilm from an acid mine drainage (AMD) [12]. However, since most marine communities are far richer in species diversity than the AMD biofilm, on the order of 100 to 200 species per milliliter of water [13,14], this further complicated their sequencing and assembly. Soil communities are even more complex, with an estimated species richness of about 4,000 species per gram of soil [13-15]. On the other hand, with recent developments in high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the 454 pyrosequencing (GS FLX Titanium Series, 454 Life Science, Roche) partly mitigating this problem, metagenomics is becoming an increasingly sophisticated approach to the study of complex DNA samples directly isolated from defined habitats [16]. According to the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) [17] until January 2009, 137 metagenomics projects were in various stages of sequencing, 72% of which were derived from environmental samples, 23% from endobiotic samples, along with 5% synthetic metagenomes. Forty-six of these projects were completed; data are available on the website Integrated Microbial Genomes with Microbiome Samples [18]Here, we review some recent metagenomic approaches to mining complex microbial communities, comprising both cultivable and non-cultivable microorganisms, for novel biocatalytic enzymes, such as glycosyl hydrolases (GHase) for industrial uses and biofuel production. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of the strategies and tools developed for targeted screening, as well as the future prospects of metagenomics in bioprospecting for new enzymes.In principle, directly isolating metagenomic DNA from the environment implies unbiased genomic representation; however, biases are introduced during its isolation, for example, resulting from differences in cell lyses. In searching for relatively under-represented genes, enrichment can increase the probability of their cloning, and hasten the process of discovering new genes. By exposing microbial communities to a selective pressure expected to entail the enrichment of microorganisms displaying the desired phenotypes (including substrate utilization, physical-, chemical-, and nutritional-selective conditions), the numbers of those community members with the desired phenotypes and corresponding target genes are successfully boosted. For example, using DNA isolated from enrichment cultures grown on cellulose as their major carbon source increased from three- to four-fold the isolation of GHase with cellulase activity from metagenome libraries, compared with the isolates from libraries made directly from total environmental DNA [19]. Also, we can remove eukaryotic community members by size-selective filtration, leaving behind enriched prokaryotic and archaeal populations [11]. Other enrichment techniques include stable isotope probing, affording a means to isolate microorganisms actively metabolizing the substrate and undergoing replication [20,21], suppressive subtractive hybridization [22-24], differential expression analysis [25], phage display, and affinity capture (reviewed by Cowan et al. [26]).Having isolated metagenomic DNA, two complementary approaches can be used for prospecting novel enzymes from it; function-based screening of expression libraries and sequence-based gene searches. In the former, metagenomic expression libraries are constructed and screened for target enzyme activities. For the latter, target genes are cloned after being amplified from metagenomic DNA by using polymerase chain reaction with conserved sequences as primers; alternatively, they may be directly discovered from metagenome sequence databases using bioinformatics tools, subsequently amplified, and cloned in the appropriate expression systems. Below, we detail these two approaches.Metagenome expression libraries are constructed by inserting fragmented metagenomic DNA into expression vectors based on plasmids, cosmids, fosmids, or phages, after which gene expression is examined in a suitable host system. The advantage of directly screening for enzymatic activities from metagenome libraries is that researchers access previously unknown genes and their encoded enzymes. Furthermore, the sequences and enzyme activities are functionally guaranteed. However, some potential drawbacks compromise this approach. Thus, before a clone correctly expresses an active enzyme, several requirements must be met. First, when functional enzymatic activity depends on more than one genetic subunit, the clone must contain the complete gene sequence, or even a gene cluster. This problem can be resolved by selecting suitable vector systems. For small target genes, DNA fragment libraries with inserts between 2 and 10 kilobase (kb) are constructed in plasmids or Lambda expression vectors, and then screened for enzyme expression. Larger gene clusters, preferentially necessitate expression libraries with inserts between 20 and 40 kb in cosmids and fosmids, and up to 100 to 200 kb in bacterial artificial chromosome vectors. Although common E. coli host strains have relaxed requirements for promoter recognition and translation initiation, many genes from environmental samples may not be expressed efficiently in heterologous hosts due to differences in codon usage, transcription and/or translation initiation signals, protein-folding elements, post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, or toxicity of the active enzyme. This obstacle is overcome partly by selecting suitable vector systems containing apposite transcription and translation-initiation sequences, and using suitable expression hosts, such as the E. coli Rosetta strains (Novagen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) that contain the tRNA genes for rare amino acid codons [27], or co-expression of the chaperone proteins, such as GroES, GroEL, and heat-shock proteins [28,29]. Alternatively, host systems such as insect cells, the yeast Pichia pastoris, and bacterial hosts such as Pseudomonas putida, Streptomyces lividans, or Bacillus subtilis were suitably improved for heterologous gene expression [30]. Furthermore, several modified function-based methods exist specifically for exploring metagenome libraries. Thus, Uchiyama and colleagues [31] developed substrate-induced gene-expression screening to rapidly identify clones that can be induced by a target substrate and display catabolic gene expression, while metabolite-regulated expression detects clones generating quorum-sensing gene-inducing compounds [32].Function-based metagenome library screening has uncovered a wide range of biocatalysts. Here, we highlight several published results that screened for polysaccharide and plant cell wall biomass-degrading enzymes, most belonging to GHase families. In most cases, colorimetric-based analyses on agar plates employing dye-linked substrates or reaction products staining were used for preliminary screening. Candidate clones were then confirmed by enzyme activity assays.Amylases attract much industrial interest and are the focus of many metagenome studies. Richardson et al. [33], Voget et al. [34], Yun et al. [35], and Lämmle et al. [36] detailed novel amylolytic enzyme activities from metagenome libraries; some of these enzymes were purified and characterized [33,35]. Cellulose is nature's most abundant biopolymer, and long has been recognized as a potential source of sugars for biofuel production. Voget and colleagues [37] obtained several cellulolytic clones by functionally screening a soil metagenome library from which they purified and characterized a cellulase. Rees et al. [38] screened a lake water metagenome library and retrieved four cellulolytic clones. From a metagenome library representing the microbial community present in the rabbit's cecum, several clones with cellulose activities were revealed [39]. Functional screening of metagenome libraries from extreme (high salinity and alkalinity) environmental samples (soil from Soda Lake, California, and lake sediments from Africa and Egypt) also disclosed cellulolytic clones [19]. Cellulolytic enzymes isolated from environments with extreme temperatures and pH values are receiving a lot of interest as these enzymes are expected to be better adapted to the conditions of industrial processes, such as the decomposition of recalcitrant plant cell wall biomass into fermentable sugars.Chitin, a compound of the fungal cell wall, is the second most abundant natural biopolymer that is broken down by chitinases. Cottrell et al. [40] acquired clones with chitinase activities from metagenome libraries derived from marine samples (filtrated from coastal sea water and estuarine water near the Delaware Bay). Hemicellulose consists primarily of xylan and constitutes the second most abundant polymer in plant biomass. Xylanase activities were detected and expressed from metagenome libraries representing the microbial communities of an insect gut [41], and the waste water from a dairy farm [42].The ester linkage between the 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid of glucuronoxylan and lignin alcohols is one type of covalent linkage connecting lignin and hemicellulose in plant cell walls. Esterases, which belong to the group of carboxylester hydrolases, hydrolyze such linkages. Esterase activities were detected from metagenome libraries of soil [43,44], lake water [38], drinking water [43], and the micro flora from bovine rumen [45]. From these libraries, clones with endo-β-1,4-glucanase activity and a clone with cyclodextrinase activity were identified [45]. Agarases are enzymes that liquefy agar by cleaving either the polymer's α-L-(1,3) linkage or its β-D-(1,4) linkage. Voget et al. [34] discovered six agarase genes in a soil metagenome library. The same library yielded two clones with pectate lyase activity, and one clone with 1,4-α-glucan branching enzyme activity [34]. Table ​Table11 summarizes the enzymes discovered via function-based screening, their metagenome origin, and the library types and sizes.Recently identified plant biomass-degrading enzymes through metagenomic approaches (metagenome libraries screening for enzyme activity)kb = kilobaseSequence-based screening methods rely on known conserved sequences, and cannot uncover non-homologous enzymes. Therefore, the drawback of this 'closed approach' is its failure to detect fundamentally different 'new' genes. However, unlike function-based methods, it can disclose target genes, regardless of gene expression and protein folding in the host, and irrespective of the completeness of the target gene's sequence. The success of this approach rests on meeting several conditions:(1) The more complex the community, the larger must be the sequencing effort. Here, the development of new sequencing technology, such as the next-generation 454-pyrosequencing, has changed the outcome. For instance, one of the first metagenome projects was the exploration of microbial communities in the drainage from acid mines [12], wherein only three bacterial and three archaeal lineages were detected. Nowadays, metagenome projects using new sequencing technologies not only generate greater total base pair reads but also have more even coverage of species within the community [17].(2) While the metagenomic approach captures representative DNA samples from diverse organisms, many sequence reads remain unassembled due to the variety of sizes of the environmental genomes, and their abundance. Therefore, a shift in focus emerged, from complete metagenome sequencing to bulk sequencing of as many possible genes and/or functions. In this latter approach, where there is less need to assemble sequences into contigs, the limiting factor becomes the lengths of the fragments that can be obtained for high-throughput screening and cloning. Ideally, the fragments must be long enough to contain the full open reading frame for the functions of interest. Accordingly, optimized 454 sequencing (approximately 450 nucleotide (nt) sequence length) looks more promising than extremely high-volume short-run (25 nt) sequencing [46,47], but still has its limitations for downstream cloning and expression of genes like GHase that vary in length from less than 1 kb to more than 20 kb. Gene-finding tools, such as MetaGene, were demonstrated to predict 90% of shotgun sequences [48].(3) New bioinformatics tools are needed for data mining, based not only on primary sequence homology but also able to predict protein structures, putative catalytic sites, and activities. With the betterment of protein classification tools, models might be designed to correlate enzyme mechanisms and protein folding. Based on this folding and the creation of putative active sites, gene function can be predicted [49-54]. We anticipate that soon sequence-based metagenome databases searches combined with bioinformatics tools will have a greater influence on mining novel biocatalyst genes than function-based methods.Several publications describe searching metagenome sequence databases in prospecting for genes and their enzymes that will be useful in biofuel production. For example, in sequencing a metagenome library of hindgut microbiota from the largest family of wood-feeding termites (Termitidae), Warnecke and colleagues [55] generated 71 million base pairs of sequence data. By detecting complete domains using global alignment, they identified more than 700 domains homologous to glycoside-hydrolase catalytic corresponding to 45 different carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) families [56], including a rich diversity of putative cellulases and hemicellulases. Schlüter and colleagues [57,58] sequenced, using 454-pyrosequencing technology, a metagenome library of the microbial community from the biogas fermenter of an agricultural biogas plant. From among the 141 million base pair sequences generated, bacteria that played dominant roles in methanogenesis and gene-encoding cellulolytic functions were identified from among the Clostridia spp. [57,58]. In the near future, we anticipate more publications on mining novel biocatalysts using sequence-based metagenome searches.According to GOLD [17], of the 137 metagenomic projects in the various stages of sequencing, 46 were finished (including 43 projects from 22 different environmental samples and 3 simulated communities), and the resulting data are available through the IMG/M website [18,56]. By searching through the list of 'genes with Pfam' (the protein family database) from every metagenome on the IMG/M website, our group retrieved 4,874 glycosyl/GHase homologues from these 46 completed metagenome databases. Then, to gain better insight into the diversity and representation of putative glycosyl hydrolases in these metagenomes, we downloaded the databases of translated sequences from all 43 environmental metagenome projects, and blast-searched them against the CAZy sequences for homologues of GHases (van der Lelie et al., unpublished data). As shown in Table ​Table2,2, using an e value < 10-40 as a cut-off threshold, we recognized 7,338 putative GHase homologues. The table also gives the metagenome size of each environmental sample, the number of homologues, and the number of putative GHases found per million base pairs. Generally, metagenome samples taken from environments that are characterized by a steady input and turnover of complex plant cell wall biomass have an increased abundance of putative GHases: the metagenomes from microbial communities derived from termite, human, and mouse guts displayed more putative GHase homologues (approximately 1.5% total gene count) than those from other samples, such as human oral microflora, uranium-contaminated groundwater or Singapore air sample (approximately 0.3% total gene count). Many of these metagenomic projects originally were targeted on different subjects, such as sulfate reduction, metal tolerance or marine archaeal anaerobic methane oxidation (denoted in descriptions of metagenome sources in Table ​Table2).2). Table ​Table33 lists the five most abundant GHase families for each environment (except the marine archaeal anaerobic methane-oxidation community that had only three GHase matches on 2.1 million base pairs). In most metagenomes, GHase family 13 represents the most abundant family. Its known activities include the following: α-amylase; pullulanase; cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase; cyclomaltodextrinase; trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase; oligo-α-glucosidase; maltogenic amylase; neopullulanase; α-glucosidase; maltotetraose-forming α-amylase; isoamylase; glucodextranase; maltohexaose-forming α-amylase; maltotriose-forming α-amylase; branching enzyme; trehalose synthase; 4-α-glucanotransferase; maltopentaose-forming α-amylase; amylosucrase; sucrose phosphorylase; malto-oligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase; isomaltulose synthase; and, amino acid transporter. The next most abundant is GHase family 23 (lysozyme type G; peptidoglycan lyase; also known in the literature as peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylase). Additionally, we found that members of the GHase family 2 (β-galactosidase; β-mannosidase; β-glucuronidase; mannosylglycoprotein endo-β-mannosidase; exo-β-glucosaminidase), and GHase family 3 (β-glucosidase; xylan 1,4-β-xylosidase; β-N-acetylhexosaminidase; glucan 1,3-β-glucosidase; glucan 1,4-β-glucosidase; exo-1,3-1,4-glucanase; α-L-arabinofuranosidase) are abundant in most environments. In fact, GHase family 13 (also known as the α-amylase family) is the largest sequence-based family of GHases, and encompasses several different enzyme activities and substrate specificities acting on α-glycosidic bonds. This might be a reason why GHase family 13 seemingly is the dominant family in most metagenomes. Clearly, homology, enzyme activity, and substrate specificity are not always well linked for GHases of the same family, thereby highlighting one weak point of homology-based screening for new GHase activities. Better classification and functional prediction of GHases should improve future bioprospecting of new ones for biofuel production.Glycosyl hydrolase homologues found in metagenome samplesaData source: IMG/M [18]; bonly protein coding sequences were included (no RNA genes); ctranslated sequences from all 43 environmental metagenome projects were blast-searched against the CAZy sequences for homologues of glycosyl hydrolases using an e value < 10-40 as a cut-off threshold; dGlycosyl hydrolase matches/total genes and matches per million base pairs provides an indication for the relative abundance of glycosyl hydrolases in the microbial community.Most abundant glycosyl hydrolase families found in different metagenome samplesaData source: IMG/M [18]; btotal number of GHase matches in each metagenome are given; translated sequences from all 43 environmental metagenome projects were blast-searched against the CAZy sequences for homologues of glycosyl hydrolases using an e value < 10-40 as a cut-off threshold; cthe five most abundant glycosyl hydrolase families are listed. GHX is short for glycosyl hydrolase family X; percentages of each glycosyl hydrolase family are indicated inside parentheses.Although the new ultra-fast sequencing technologies quickly generate a remarkable number of target gene candidates, functional assays are still needed to confirm them. Assays for protein function represent one of the most reliable and irreplaceable tools for mining target genes, and, therefore, developing high through-put functional screening methods is a priority for reducing the time exhausted in primary screening. Furthermore, such future screening methods might valuably be combined with other technologies, such as micro-arrays, biosensors, or proteomics tools to accelerate the discovery of new biocatalyst genes.The metagenomics approach provided valuable insight into a full range of microbial diversity in the environment, regardless of their cultivability. However, the complexity of microbial species, together with the limitations of the technology to cover fully whole genome sequences of every species present still pose a great challenge for metagenome research. A few bioinformatics programs are established for assembling and binning metagenome sequences, for gene prediction and annotation, estimating community composition, and data management (see Kunin et al. [60] for review). In addition, the European Union-funded 'MetaFunctions' project [61] also covers the development of 'metagenomes Mapserver', a data-mining system that correlates genetic patterns in genomes and metagenomes with contextual environmental data. Nevertheless, more innovative and sophisticated bioinformatics tools must be devised to assure continued valuable progress in the field of metagenomics.With the depletion of fossil fuels and growing environmental awareness, bioenergy production from renewable, non-food resources more and more enters into public focus. The natural gene diversity and complexity found in metagenomes is remarkable, affording us an ideal resource for mining of novel biocatalytics that efficiently break down recalcitrant plant biomass into fermentable sugars for generating biofuels and other chemical commodities. With the development of new biotechnologies and bioinformatics tools, our discovery of, and access to novel enzymes via metagenomic approaches potentially may significantly contribute to their future economical production from renewable resources.AMD: acid mine drainage; CAZy: carbohydrate-active enzymes; GHase: glycosyl hydrolase; GOLD: Genomes OnLine Database; IMG/M: Integrated Microbial Genomes with Microbiome Samples; kb: kilobase; nt: nucleotide.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.LLL participated in the metagenome data analysis and wrote the manuscript.

PMC2698378,Transcriptome and Secretome Analyses of Phanerochaete chrysosporium Reveal Complex Patterns of Gene Expression▿ †,False,"The wood decay basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium was grown under standard ligninolytic or cellulolytic conditions and subjected to whole-genome expression microarray analysis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of extracellular proteins. A total of 545 genes were flagged on the basis of significant changes in transcript accumulation and/or peptide sequences of the secreted proteins. Under nitrogen or carbon limitation, lignin and manganese peroxidase expression increased relative to nutrient replete medium. Various extracellular oxidases were also secreted in these media, supporting a physiological connection based on peroxide generation. Numerous genes presumed to be involved in mobilizing and recycling nitrogen were expressed under nitrogen limitation, and among these were several secreted glutamic acid proteases not previously observed. In medium containing microcrystalline cellulose as the sole carbon source, numerous genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes were upregulated. Among these were six members of the glycoside hydrolase family 61, as well as several polysaccharide lyases and carbohydrate esterases. Presenting a daunting challenge for future research, more than 190 upregulated genes are predicted to encode proteins of unknown function. Of these hypothetical proteins, approximately one-third featured predicted secretion signals, and 54 encoded proteins detected in extracellular filtrates. Our results affirm the importance of certain oxidative enzymes and, underscoring the complexity of lignocellulose degradation, also support an important role for many new proteins of unknown function.Global conversion of organic carbon to CO2 with concomitant reduction of molecular oxygen involves the combined metabolic activity of numerous organisms. The most abundant source of carbon is plant biomass, composed primarily of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Many microorganisms are capable of utilizing cellulose and hemicellulose as carbon and energy sources, but a much smaller group of filamentous fungi has evolved with the ability to depolymerize lignin, the most recalcitrant component of plant cell walls. Collectively known as white rot fungi, they possess the unique ability to efficiently depolymerize lignin in order to gain access to cell wall carbohydrates for carbon and energy sources. These wood decay fungi are common inhabitants of forest litter and fallen trees. As such, white rot fungi play an important, if not pivotal, role in the carbon cycle (for a review, see reference 15).The ∼30-Mb haploid genome of the most intensively studied white rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, has been sequenced by the U.S. Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute. Analysis of the draft genome (38) and substantially improved assembly and gene models (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Phchr1/Phchr1.home.html [53]) revealed many genes potentially involved in lignocellulose degradation. These genome resources have facilitated mass spectrometric identification of extracellular proteins in defined (43, 55), semidefined (54), and complex (1, 39, 41) media. In some instances, the investigations affirm the importance of well-characterized oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes, but considerable uncertainty persists with respect to the roles and interactions of hundreds of genes. To provide a more complete view of gene expression, we report here transcriptome and secretome analyses of P. chrysosporium grown under defined ligninolytic and cellulolytic conditions.RNA for microarrays was obtained from P. chrysosporium strain RP78 (Forest Mycology Center, Forest Products Laboratory) grown in the following media: (i) RB (replete B3 medium [30, 31]) with sufficient carbon and nitrogen harvested during log-phase growth; (ii) CLB (carbon-limited B3 medium) harvested during stationary phase; (iii) NLB (nitrogen-limited B3 medium) harvested during stationary phase; (iv) HBG (Highley's basal salts medium [20] supplemented with glucose); (v) HBA (Highley's basal salts medium supplemented with cellulose). RB medium contained (per liter): 1.73 g of trans-aconitic acid, 2 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g of CaCl2·2H2O, 1.6 g of ammonium tartrate, 10 g of glucose, and 1 mg of thiamine. The medium was supplemented with 10 ml of mineral solution containing (per liter): 1.5 g of nitrilotriacetic acid, 3 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g of MnSO4·H2O, 1 g of NaCl, 0.1 g of FeSO4·H2O, 0.1 g of CoSO4, 0.1 g of CaCl2, 0.1 g of ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g of CuSO4, 0.01 g of AlK(SO4) 2·12H2O, 0.01 g of H3BO3, and 0.01 g of NaMoO4·2H2O. A total of 50 ml of RB was inoculated with ∼106 spores in 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, and the stationary-phase cultures were harvested after 2 days at 37°C. CLB and NLB composition were identical except that glucose and ammonia tartrate were reduced to 2 g and 0.2 g liter−1, respectively. After incubation for 2 days, these nutrient-deprived cultures were flushed with oxygen and tightly stoppered. CLB and NLB cultures were harvested after 4 and 5 days, respectively. Transcript patterns and enzyme systems have been extensively studied using B3 media (reviewed in references 16, 28, and 45). Highley's basal medium contained (per liter): 2 g of NH4NO3, 2 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g of CaCl2·2H2O, 1 mg of thiamine, and 10 ml of the above-mentioned mineral solution. This basal medium was supplemented with 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose (HBG) or with 0.5% microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel, PH-101; Fluka Chemie, Switzerland) (HBA). Aliquots (250 ml) of medium were inoculated with ∼107 spores in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks, and the cultures were harvested after 5 days on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 37°C.Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of extracellular proteins included RB, HBA, and WBC or Wood's medium (59). WBC is known to support high yields of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH). Comparative analysis also considered protein patterns previously determined in NLB, CLB (53), and NMA (modified Norkran's medium with Avicel [13, 54]) and, characterized by others, in medium containing complex lignocellulose substrates (1, 41).Culture supernatants with all media were tested for lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP), glyoxal oxidase (GLX) and CDH enzyme activities. LiP activity, measured by veratryl alcohol oxidation (50), was detectable only in CLB and NLB at 65 and 8.8 nmol min−1 ml−1, respectively. Oxidation of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol was used to measure MnP (57) which, like LiP, was restricted to CLB and NLB at 2.6 and 11 nmol min−1 ml−1. GLX was measured using methylglyoxal as the oxidase substrate and phenol red as the substrate for horseradish peroxidase in a coupled assay (29, 30). CLB and NLB supernatants showed GLX activities of 2.6 and 3.4 nmol min−1 ml−1, respectively. Detection of CDH was based on reduction of 100 μM dichlorophenol-indophenol using cellobiose (500 μM) as the electron donor in 20 mM (pH 4.5) succinate buffer (2). CDH activity was detectable only in WBC (130 nmol min−1 ml−1) and NMA (63 nmol min−1 ml−1) cultures.From a data set of 10,004 unique alleles, each Roche NimbleGen (Madison, WI) array featured 12 unique 60mer probes per gene, all in triplicate. (Seven gene models composed mostly of repetitive DNA were represented by only 2 to 11 60mers.) Complete design details are available under platform {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GPL8022"",""term_id"":""8022""}}GPL8022 within the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/index.cgi).Total RNA was purified from the five above-mentioned media. In short, cultures were harvested by filtering through Miracloth (Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ), squeeze dried, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were stored at −80°C until use. Extraction buffer was prepared by combining 10 ml of 690 mM para-aminosalicylic acid (sodium salt) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with 10 ml of 56 mM tri-isopropylnapthalene sulfonic acid (sodium salt; Sigma-Aldrich) and placed on ice. To this was added 5 ml of 5× RNB (1.0 M Tris, 1.25 M NaCl, 0.25 M EGTA). The pH of the 5× RNB was adjusted to 8.5 with NaOH. The mixture was kept on ice and shaken just before use.Frozen fungal pellets were ground to a fine powder with liquid nitrogen in an acid-washed, prechilled mortar and pestle. The ground mycelia were transferred to Falcon 2059 tubes (VWR International, West Chester, PA), and extraction buffer was added to make a thick slurry. The samples were vortex mixed vigorously and placed on ice until all samples were processed. A one-half volume of Tris-EDTA-saturated phenol (Sigma-Aldrich) and a one-quarter volume chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to each sample, followed by vigorous vortex mixing. Samples were spun at 2,940 × g in a fixed-angle rotor for 5 min. The aqueous layer was moved to a new tube, and phenol-chloroform extractions were repeated until the interface between the aqueous and organic layers was clear. The final aqueous extractions were placed in clean 2059 tubes, to which was added 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2; diethyl pyrocarbonate treated) and 2 volumes of absolute ethanol. The tubes were shaken vigorously and stored overnight at −20°C.The tubes were spun 1 h at 2,940 × g, the supernatants were decanted, and the pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of RNase-free H2O. Total RNA was purified by using an RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol for RNA cleanup. RNAs were eluted from the RNeasy spin columns using two spins, for a final volume of 2 ml. The eluted RNAs were ethanol precipitated and stored overnight at −20°C. The RNAs were spun 1 h at 2,940 × g, washed once with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 50 to 100 μl of RNase-free H2O. Three biological replicates per medium were used (15 separate arrays).RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA and labeled with a Cy3 fluorophore for hybridization to the array by Roche NimbleGen (Iceland). In brief, 10 μg of total RNA was incubated with 1× first-strand buffer, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 100 pM oligonucleotide T7 d(T)24 primer, and 400 U of SuperScript II (Invitrogen) for 60 min at 42°C. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized by incubation with 1× second-strand buffer, 0.2 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.07 U of DNA ligase/μl, 0.27 U of DNA polymerase I/μl, and 0.013 U of RNase H/μl at 16°C for 2 h. (DNA ligase, DNA polymerase I, and RNase H were obtained from Invitrogen.) Immediately afterward, 10 U of T4 DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was added for an additional 5 min of incubation at 16°C. Double-stranded cDNA was treated with 27 ng of RNase A (EpiCenter Technologies)/μl for 10 min at 37°C. Treated cDNA was purified by using an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (Ambion), ethanol precipitated, washed with 80% ethanol, and resuspended in 20 μl of water. Then, 1 μg of each cDNA sample was amplified and labeled with 1 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs)/μl and 1 optical density unit of Cy3 fluorophore (TriLink Biotechnologies, Inc.) for 2 h at 37°C. Array hybridization was carried out with 6 μg of labeled cDNA suspended in NimbleGen hybridization solution for 17 h at 42°C. Arrays were scanned on an Axon 4000B scanner (Molecular Dynamics), and data were extracted from the scanned image by using NimbleScan v2.4. ArrayStar v2.1 (DNAStar, Madison, WI) software was used to quantify and visualize data. Analyses were based on three biological replicates per culture medium. Quantile normalization and robust multiarray averaging (21) were applied to the entire data set. Scatterplots of results are shown in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material. Unless otherwise specified, expression levels are based on log2 values. All MIAME compliant (4) microarray expression data have been deposited in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)'s GEO and are accessible through GEO series accession number {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE14736"",""term_id"":""14736""}}GSE14736.Competitive reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to quantify transcripts of the copper radical oxidase genes glx and cro2, as previously described (55). For the transcripts of CDH (cdh1), the upstream and downstream primers were 5′-GGCTCGCCCCAACTTCACTT-3′ and 5′-GTTGTACGGCAGCGACGAG-3′, respectively. These primers yielded cDNA and competitive template amplicons of 556 and 709 nucleotides, respectively.Soluble extracellular protein was concentrated from culture filtrates as previously reported (53, 54). After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fractionation, “in gel” digestion and MS analysis were performed as described elsewhere (www.biotech.wisc.edu/ServicesResearch/MassSpec/ingel.htm). An in-house licensed Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom) identified peptides using the 10,048 gene models in the v2.1 data set (53). To facilitate comparison, Mascot analysis was also extended to data previously analyzed by Spectrum Mill MS (Agilent). Mascot scores of ≥40 were considered highly significant. Throughout, protein similarity scores are based on the Smith-Waterman algorithm (46) using the BLOSUM62 matrix. P. chrysosporium protein model identification numbers are preceded by “Pchr.” Detailed information for each protein can be directly accessed by appending the model number to the following string: http://genome.jgi-psf.org/cgi-bin/dispGeneModel?db=Phchr1&id=X, where X is the one- to five-digit model number. We assigned function or “putative” function only when supported by direct experimental evidence or when comparisons to known proteins revealed conserved catalytic features and/or significant alignment scores (bit scores > 150) to known proteins within the Swiss-Prot database. All other proteins were designated “hypothetical,” and those with significant homology (bit scores > 150) to other conceptual translations within GenBank were considered “conserved hypothetical” proteins.Our analysis focused on transcript profiles in widely used defined ligninolytic (nutrient-limited B3 media) and cellulolytic (cellulose-induced) cultures. Essentially, the microarrays examined three pairwise comparisons: (i) carbon-limited (CLB) versus nutrient-replete B3 media (RB); (ii) nitrogen-limited (NLB) versus RB; and (iii) Highley's basal medium supplemented with avicel (HBA) versus glucose-supplemented basal salts (HBG). Of 10,004 genes represented on arrays, transcripts of 208, 163, and 136 genes exhibited ≥2-fold differences (P < 0.01) in transcript accumulation in the pairwise comparisons of CLB versus RB, NLB versus RB, and HBA versus HBG, respectively (Fig. ​(Fig.1A1A and see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Of these, 33, 63, and 70 genes were upregulated (accumulated ≥2-fold) in CLB, NLB, and HBA, respectively (Fig. ​(Fig.1B).1B). (GEO “superseries” {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE14736"",""term_id"":""14736""}}GSE14736 lists log2 and linear response signals for all 10,004 targets in all media, together with expression ratios, genome locations, and InterPro domains.)Venn diagrams illustrating the distribution of regulated genes (A and B) and MS-identified proteins (C). (A) Genes with transcript levels that change ≥2-fold in comparisons of nitrogen-limited and nutrient-replete media (NLB versus RB), carbon-limited and nutrient-replete media (CLB versus RB), and cellulose- and glucose-containing media (HBA versus HBG). (B) Genes with transcripts that are upregulated ≥2-fold in these same comparisons. (C) Genes encoding proteins identified by LC-MS/MS in NLB, CLB, and HBA. “Upregulation” is arbitrarily assigned to genes whose transcripts accumulate in NLB relative to RB, in CLB relative to RB, and in HBA relative to HBG. The corresponding “downregulated” genes are not enumerated in this figure but are listed in Table S3 in the supplemental material. In all cases, values within overlapping regions have not been subtracted from totals. For example, peptides corresponding to a total of 37 protein models were identified in HBA medium. Of the 37, 8 were also present in carbon-limited medium, and 4 of these were common to all three media. An additional 61 proteins were identified in Wood's cellulose-containing medium (WBC), and these are listed in Table S3 in the supplemental material.In these same media, LC-MS/MS unambiguously identified peptide sequences corresponding to 46, 23, and 37 genes (Fig. ​(Fig.1C).1C). MS data for CLB and NLB was previously acquired and subjected to Spectrum Mill MS (Agilent) analysis (53) but analyzed here by Mascot to simplify comparison. HBA MS data was not previously reported, nor were the 101 and 76 proteins identified in RB and in Wood's cellulose-containing medium (WBC), respectively. Complete listings of peptide sequences, scores, and corresponding gene models are presented in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material. Correlation coefficients between the peptide Mascot score and the microarray signal strength were 0.04, 0.36, 0.77, and 0.1 for RB (n = 101), NLB (n = 23), CLB (n = 46), and HBA (n = 37), respectively.In aggregate, our microarray and proteome analyses flagged 545 genes based on significant transcript regulation and/or on identification of specific peptide sequences in extracellular fluids. Table S3 in the supplemental material contains detailed information for all of these genes, including putative function, characteristics of the predicted proteins (pI, molecular weight, targeting signals), microarray signals for all replicates, Interpro hits, highest Swiss-Prot hits with scoring, genome localization, and MS scores from all media. For all gene models, supporting evidence, annotations, and analyses are available through the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute's genome portal at www.jgi.doe.gov/whiterot.Focusing on genes upregulated in ligninolytic (CLB and NLB) and cellulolytic (HBA) media, substantial differences were observed in the number and distribution of functional categories (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2). Among the more dramatic differences, the numbers of upregulated genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZYs) was significantly higher in HBA, while genes involved in nitrogen metabolism were predominant in NLB.Distribution of P. chrysosporium genes encoding upregulated transcripts in carbon limited B3 medium (CLB, inner ring), nitrogen-limited B3 medium (NLB, center ring), and Highley's basal medium containing avicel (HBA, outer ring). Parenthetical values following each category refer to the number of genes in CLB, NLB, and HBA.Nitrogen limitation, perhaps analogous to decayed wood (34), was accompanied by the accumulation of an impressive battery of transcripts involved in the mobilization and recycling of nitrogen (Table ​(Table1).1). Among these were various transmembrane proteins involved in the transport of small-molecular-weight nitrogenous compounds and an impressive family of related oligopeptide transporters (OPTs). Recent phylogenetic analysis (37) shows large families of OPT genes in P. chrysosporium, Coprinopsis cinereus, and Laccaria bicolor. Differential regulation of OPT genes has been observed in response to growth conditions and developmental state for the ectomycorrhiza L. bicolor and Hebeloma cylindrosporum (3, 37). In particular, H. cylindrosporum PTR2A is upregulated under nitrogen limitation, and transcripts of the homologous P. chrysosporium gene (protein model Pchr10757) are highly expressed, showing a modest increase in NLB (NLB/RB ratio of 1.89; see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Although coordinately expressed, no physical clustering of OPT genes was observed in the P. chrysosporium v2.0 assembly.Upregulated P. chrysosporium genes involved in nitrogen metabolismaTranscripts of five proteases were upregulated in nitrogen starved B3 cultures, and three of these (asp5, asp3, and prt53B) correspond to previously identified proteins (41, 53). No peptides were detected for the M38 (Pchr133689) and S10 (Pchr2647) families, although an earlier study had identified peptides from other genes representing the S10 peptidase family (53). Within the S53 family, only prt53B transcripts accumulated >2-fold (Table ​(Table1),1), but peptides corresponding to prt53D (Pchr129261), prt53E (Pchr26825), prt53A (Pchr133020), and a previously unidentified gene (Pchr125335) were also detected (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). As recently reported (36), the related basidiomycete C. cinereus contains an expanded family of extracellular fungalysins (MEROPS family M36), which are represented by a single sequence in P. chrysosporium, Pchr37396. The transcript accumulation of the P. chrysosporium gene was modest (NLB/RB ratio of 1.51), and no peptides were detected in any media (see the supplemental table in GEO {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE14736"",""term_id"":""14736""}}GSE14736).Unexpectedly, we observed transcript accumulation and peptide sequences of two glutamic acid proteases (Pchr131262 and Pchr43144), representatives of which had not been previously observed (53, 54) (Table ​(Table1).1). Peptides corresponding to a third family G1 representative, Pchr121400, were also detected (see Table S3 in the supplemental material), although significant transcript increases were not observed. In their analysis of the v1.0 assembly, Sims et al. (44) noted a large number of glutamic acid proteases, in contrast to other basidiomycetes. These authors also reported clustering of four G1-encoding genes, and the latest assembly extends the linkage to six genes (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3). Although the three genes encoding detectable protein lie within a 21-kb region, transcriptional regulation among the six linked genes follows no easily discernible pattern. For example, genes corresponding to Pchr120995 and Pchr4009 were expressed under all conditions examined, whereas those encoding Pchr131262 and Pchr43144 were significantly upregulated in cellulose-containing medium.Organization and expression of scaffold 5 cluster of family G1 proteases. Purple filled arrows denote G1 family peptidases. Protein models Pchr31964 and Pchr43144 (indicated by asterisks) are truncated at the 5′ termini, but alternative ab initio models Pchr3963 and Pchr4008, respectively, reveal complete sequence with predicted secretion signals (green fill). Vertical colored bars indicate microarray-derived expression results from nutrient-limited cultures versus nutrient-replete medium and from cellulose-containing medium versus glucose-containing medium. The lower right scale indicates the log2 signal strength. Peptides corresponding to models Pchr131262, Pchr43144, and Pchr121400 were identified by LC-MS/MS, and the corresponding Mascot scores are listed.Genes encoding CAZYs (5) also revealed dramatic differential regulation in response to culture conditions (Table ​(Table2).2). Table ​Table22 lists 70 genes exhibiting significant transcript accumulation and/or peptide scores. Expression of many of these genes was previously recognized in proteome studies, and detailed biochemical analyses have been performed on several endoglucanases (18, 51), cellobiohydrolases (52), endoxylanases (9), endo-1,3(4)-β-glucanase (26), α-galactosidases (17), β-1,3-glucanase (25), and xyloglucanase (22). In other instances, we have inferred putative function by sequence similarity to accessions within the Swiss-Prot database (see Table S3 in the supplemental material).P. chrysosporium CAZY genes exhibiting >2-fold upregulation and/or encoding peptides detected by LC-MS/MSaCertain glycoside hydrolase families are functionally heterogeneous. The P. chrysosporium v2.1 genome contains at least 13 sequences belonging to family 61, and six of these genes are clearly expressed under the conditions examined here (Table ​(Table2).2). The gene encoding Pchr121193 was dramatically upregulated and highly expressed in media containing microcrystalline cellulose as the sole carbon source (HBA). This observation, together with the clear presence of a highly conserved cellulose-binding domain, certainly support a role in cellulose degradation, possibly as an endoglucanase. Still, a recent investigation (24) points out the need for additional examination of the structure and activities of enzymes within family 61.Upregulated CAZY-encoding genes also included two polysaccharide lyases (PL families 8 and 14) and a carbohydrate esterase family 1 representative. The most accurate model for the latter, Pchr7224, features separate cellulose binding and catalytic domains. Based on similarity to Penicillium feruloyl esterases (32), the protein was tentatively identified as an acetyl xylanase esterase, possibly involved in hydrolyzing ester bonds in arabinoxylans. Peptides matching another carbohydrate esterase, Pchr130517, were detected in several media, and modest transcript accumulation was observed in CLB (ratio 1.77) and in HBA (ratio 1.89). The corresponding enzyme, a glucuronyl esterase, appears to belong to a new and distinct carbohydrate esterase family (11). The lyase sequences showed relatively little similarity to proteins of known function, although both are closely related (BLASTP bit scores of >350) to conceptual translations from L. bicolor and C. cinereus.β-1,3-Glucan and mixed-linkage β-1,3-1,4-glucans are common constituents of cell walls of certain cereal grains, grasses, and related plants, and chitin is a major component of the cell walls of yeasts and other fungi. Chitinases (GH18), α-trehalases (GH37), and other glycosidases may be involved in cell wall morphogenesis.The biochemistry and genetics of LiP and MnP have been intensively studied, and the observed influence of medium composition (Table ​(Table3)3) is consistent with previously reported Northern blot and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) results (reviewed in references 16 and 28). Earlier studies (47) had failed to identify any clear relationship between clustering and the transcriptional regulation of 8 LiP genes, and in the present study we extended the analysis to 16 additional genes interspersed within the lip cluster (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). In short, no obvious relationship(s) were gleaned from this analysis.Upregulated P. chrysosporium genes potentially involved in degradation of lignin and aromatic compoundsaGLX, thought to be physiologically coupled to extracellular peroxidases via peroxide generation, was also upregulated under nutrient starvation (Table ​(Table3)3) as previously established by Northern blots (48). Peptides corresponding to a structurally related copper radical oxidase gene, cro2 (Pchr134241), were identified, and while transcript levels were generally high, the gene was slightly downregulated in NLB, CLB, and HBA (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). The GMC oxidoreductases pyranose 2 oxidase (pox, Pchr137275) and aryl alcohol dehydrogenase (aad, Pchr11055) are also potentially involved in peroxide generation, and transcripts accumulated in CLB as previously reported (10, 40). No significant transcript accumulation was noted for several related GMC oxidoreductases, although peptides were detected for three genes distantly related to glucose oxidase (see Table S3 in the supplemental material).Other upregulated genes possibly related to lignin degradation include a family 67 P450 (Pchr138737) and a family 2 peroxidase (Pchr34295) (Table ​(Table3).3). These enzymes may be involved in the intracellular metabolism of low-molecular-weight lignans and other breakdown products. We also observed upregulation of genes encoding O-methyltransferase (see Table S3 in the supplemental material) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (Table ​(Table1)1) in both CLB and NLB. These enzymes might be involved in multiple pathways, including the biosynthesis of veratryl alcohol (23). Secreted by P. chrysosporium, veratryl alcohol has been implicated in lignin depolymerization, although the precise mechanism remains uncertain (reviewed in reference 16).Also implicated in lignin degradation, CDH transcript accumulation was most pronounced in cellulose-containing medium (Table ​(Table3).3). This enzyme contains separate iron reductase and dehydrogenase domains and can generate highly reactive hydroxyl radical capable of depolymerizing cellulose and lignin (for a review, see reference 19). Although high transcript levels were observed in HBA, no protein was detected by LC-MS/MS, and no activity could be measured in that medium. Transcript accumulation was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. ​(Fig.4).4). In contrast, the protein and activity were easily detected in NMA and WBC cultures (Table ​(Table3),3), and we therefore presume some form of posttranscriptional regulation is operative. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the production of active CDH in cultures is particularly sensitive to growth buffers such as succinate, acetate, and phosphate, a factor that could also be physiologically relevant (2). The CBM1-containing gene cir1, closely related to the reductase domain of cdh1 (60), was also upregulated in HBA, but no peptides were detected.Transcript levels of copper radical oxidase (cro2), CDH (cdh1), and copper radical oxidase (glx) as determined by qRT-PCR (A) and microarray (B).An impressive 193 genes encoding proteins of unknown function were regulated ≥2-fold and/or detected by MS (for full details, see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Of these, 111 were closely related (bit scores > 150) to at least one NCBI conceptual translation, often derived from the basidiomycetes C. cinereus, L. bicolor, or Postia placenta. Transcript accumulation >2-fold was observed for 12, 23, and 24 “hypothetical” genes in CLB versus RB, NLB versus RB, and HBA versus HBG, respectively. Peptide sequences corresponding to 55 genes were detected, and 40 of these were not previously reported. Transmembrane helices (TMHMM v.2.0 [www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/]) were present in ≥18 predicted proteins, and secretion signals (SignalP v.3.0; www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) were observed in 61 models. Also potentially relevant to their function, we identified putative glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (http://mendel.imp.ac.at/sat/gpi/fungi_server.html), mitochondrial signal sequences (TargetP v.1.1;/www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/), and carbohydrate binding modules (www.cazy.org/) in nine, three, and three sequences, respectively. BlastP and CLUSTAL W (49) analysis of all 193 hypothetical proteins distributed 37 proteins into 16 groups each containing between two and four members each. Fifty genes encoding hypothetical proteins were located within 10 kb of one another (25 pairs). In several instances, the closely linked genes were structurally related and/or similarly regulated (Table ​(Table44).Tandemly arranged paralogs encoding hypothetical proteins with secretion signalsaA complete characterization of the P. chrysosporium secretome will illuminate the repertoire of enzymes involved in lignocellulose depolymerization. Computational analysis of the v2.1 annotations had previously predicted 769 secreted proteins (53). Although useful, such predictions are likely incomplete since many models feature inaccurate 5′ termini, and some proteins with signal peptides are secreted into the cell wall or into vacuoles or are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, certain proteins may be secreted in the absence of a recognizable signal. Clearly, direct experimental support for secretion is preferred.Substantial progress has been made using MS-based protein identification (1, 39, 41, 43, 54, 55), but these approaches have limitations. Low-abundance, low-molecular-weight, and unstable proteins are less likely to be detected. Highly glycosylated proteins and/or those adhering to cell walls or substrate may also escape detection. Incomplete annotation may be problematic under some circumstances, as previously observed for a GH45-encoding gene (54).Microarrays offer a complementing perspective on gene expression, although here too, limitations must be considered. Although there is generally a good correlation between expression levels and LC-MS/MS identification of secreted proteins, exceptions such as CDH were noted. Other examples of highly transcribed genes with putative secretion signals, but without LC-MS/MS support, include a putative aldose-1-epimerase. In contrast, high scoring peptides were sometimes associated with relatively low transcript levels. For example, peptides corresponding to class 3 lipase Pchr8996 were easily detected (Mascot score 652) in CLB, but the microarray signal for the gene (log2 11.7) was somewhat lower than the genomewide average signal (log2 12.39 ± 1.18). Similarly, multiple, high-scoring peptides were assigned to hypothetical models Pchr5499 (Mascot score 1128) and Pchr5500 (Mascot score 673) in HBA, but the array values of log2 10.8 and 10.5, respectively, were well below the average signal in this medium (12.14 ± 1.30). Interestingly, these tandemly arranged hypothetical proteins do not feature canonical secretion signals, but SecretomeP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SecretomeP/) analysis predicts potential “nonclassical” signals. Possibly, such proteins are stable and accumulate during growth, although transcript turnover/instability may also be involved.Irrespective, transcript and LC-MS/MS patterns alone cannot firmly establish the role of specific genes in lignocellulose depolymerization. In most instances, enzyme characterization and/or genetic suppression are necessary. However, such approaches are technically challenging with filamentous basidiomycetes, particularly on a high-throughput basis. Complementary approaches such as microarrays and LC-MS/MS, albeit imperfect, provide a filter for focusing on the more promising genes.A distinguishing feature of the P. chrysosporium genome is the occurrence of large and complex families of related sequences including genes encoding cytochrome P450s, peroxidases, glycoside hydrolases, proteases, copper radical oxidases, and multicopper oxidases. In some instances, a close linkage has been observed, but there is scant evidence relating transcriptional regulation and such clustering. This was previously demonstrated for the lignin peroxidases (47) and again here for the G1 family proteases (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3). The role of genetic multiplicity remains unclear. Structurally related genes may encode proteins with subtle differences in function, and such diversity may provide the flexibility needed in changing environmental conditions (pH, temperature, and ionic strength), substrate composition and accessibility, and wood species. Alternatively, some or all of the genetic multiplicity may merely reflect functional redundancy. Functional characterization of individual genes has been limited.Nutrient-limited B3 medium has been widely used in studies of ligninolysis, and our results provide a broad view of potentially important proteins. Supporting the close physiological connections between GLX and the extracellular peroxidases of P. chrysosporium, coordinate upregulation was observed (Table ​(Table3).3). GLX has a regulatory mechanism responsive to peroxidase, peroxidase substrates, and peroxidase products (e.g., phenolics resulting from ligninolysis) (33). The oxidase becomes inactive in the absence of a coupled peroxidase system but is reactivated by lignin peroxidase and nonphenolic peroxidase substrates. Conversely, phenolics prevent activation by lignin peroxidase. GLX is also activated by lignin in the coupled reaction with LiP (33). The basis for this modulation in GLX activity is probably related, at least in part, to the redox interconversion (E1/2 = 0.64 V versus NHE, pH 7) of active and inactive forms of the enzyme (58).Two glucose oxidases have been reported in P. chrysosporium cultures: glucose 1-oxidase from P. chrysosporium ME-446 and glucose 2-oxidase or pyranose 2-oxidase from P. chrysosporium K3 (reviewed in reference 28). While predominantly intracellular in liquid cultures of P. chrysosporium, evidence supports an important role for pyranose 2-oxidase in wood decay, with no evidence for glucose 1-oxidase (8). Pyranose 2-oxidase is preferentially localized in the periplasmic space and associated membranous materials and, as expected, peptides were not detected in extracellular fluids. The P. chrysosporium pyranose 2-oxidase transcript patterns are similar to lignin peroxidases and GLX, supporting a role in lignocellulose degradation (10). Peptides corresponding to three glucose-oxidase-like sequences have now been detected (see Table S3 in the supplemental material), but none exhibited substantial upregulation under nutrient limitation, and only transcripts matching the Pchr6270-encoding gene showed an increase in the cellulose-containing medium, HBA. Previously designated gox1, this model is related (Smith-Waterman score = 480) to Aspergillus niger glucose-1-oxidase (38). The function of gox1 and related genes is yet to be determined.Structurally related to glucose oxidases (56), several putative aryl alcohol oxidase genes have been identified in P. chrysosporium. Specifically, Pchr135972, Pchr37188, and Pchr6199 are 46.3, 43.8, and 39.0% identical, respectively, to the aryl alcohol oxidases from Pleurotus eryngii (gi3851524). However, none of the corresponding transcripts accumulated under the conditions examined. The precise role(s) of these enzymes remain uncertain, but they may support a redox cycle by supplying extracellular peroxide, perhaps coupled to intracellular aryl alcohol dehydrogenase (56). Transcripts matching the latter protein model (Pchr11055) were significantly upregulated under nutrient limitation (Table ​(Table33).Of course genes highly expressed, but not necessarily upregulated, may also play a crucial role in lignin depolymerization. For example, genes encoding a methanol oxidase (Pchr126879) and catalase (Pchr124398) are highly expressed in all media (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). In the brown rot fungus, Gloeophyllum trabeum, methanol oxidase may generate peroxide at or near the hyphal surface (7). The peroxide is hypothesized to spontaneously react with Fe2+ to form hydroxyl radicals that depolymerize cellulose. Similar nonenzymatic Fenton reactions have been implicated in lignin and cellulose depolymerization in P. chrysosporium (reviewed in reference 28). Since demethoxylation of lignin is common to white and brown rot, oxidation of methanol may be a crucial reaction. Catalase activity has been identified in the periplasmic space of P. chrysosporium grown under ligninolytic conditions (6), and recent MS studies associated the model Pchr124398 protein with membrane fractions (42).Other expressed genes include several potentially important in posttranslational processing. Transcripts of a mannose-6-phosphatase encoding gene, mpa, showed modest increase in CLB and, as previously observed (53), the peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Evidence suggests that this enzyme dephosphorylates certain LiP isozymes (reviewed in reference 28). Proteolytic processing of peroxidases (reviewed in reference 28), cellulases (14), and CDH (12) may also play an important role in wood decay, and our results identify several candidate peptidases. Peptides corresponding to two family G1 proteases were identified solely in HBA, and the corresponding transcripts were substantially upregulated (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3). Five protease genes showed substantial accumulation in NLB relative to RB. Of these, Pchr8468 was among the most highly upregulated genes in the genome (NLB/RB ratio 10.3) and Pchr2647 was predicted to contain a GPI anchor. Likely, these observations reflect acquisition and recycling of nitrogen, but interactions with LiP cannot be ruled out. No significant (>2-fold) upregulation of proteases was observed under carbon limitation (CLB).Not unexpectedly, we observed peptides and upregulated transcripts matching well-characterized cellulases in HBA. These included CBH2 (GH6), CBH1s (GH7s), and several GH5 endoglucanases. The potential involvement of several highly expressed GH61s in cellulose degradation merits additional study. Other genes upregulated in HBA are likely involved in hemicellulose degradation, and these include various xylanases, mannanase, α- and β-galactosidases, polygalacturonase, arabinofuranosidase, xyloglucanases, and feruloyl esterase. None of the CAZY encoding genes were upregulated in nitrogen-starved medium (NLB), although transcripts of several β-1,3-glucanase genes increased substantially under carbon limitation. Of these, lam55 (25) was among the most highly expressed (log2 15.5) and upregulated (HBA/HBG ratio of 13.2) genes in CLB (Table ​(Table2).2). Since hyphal cell walls contain β-1,3-glucans and chitin, GH16 and GH55 enzymes may be involved in morphogenesis and nutrient recycling.Many of the 193 expressed hypothetical proteins observed here are undoubtedly involved in lignocellulose degradation. One-third of the sequences featured easily identifiable secretion signals, and peptides corresponding to 54 gene models were detected in extracellular filtrates. Especially intriguing among secreted proteins, Pchr138739 features a clear N-terminal cellulose-binding domain (CBM1), and transcription of the gene was substantially upregulated (ratio of 5.58) in HBA. Similarly, the gene encoding serine-rich protein Pchr138739 showed high transcript levels (log2 14.3) and upregulation (ratio of 3.80) in HBA.Most genes encoding hypothetical proteins lack canonical secretion signals, although other structural features and expression patterns provide clues about function. Of the three genes upregulated >2-fold in both CLB and NLB, models Pchr8832, Pchr600, and Pchr1903 feature sequences supporting mitochondrial transport (TargetP, www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/), a GPI anchor, and transmembrane location, respectively. Protein model Pchr6670 contains a centrally located transmembrane region and shows similarity to various cell surface proteins if low-complexity serine- and proline-rich regions are included in the BLASTP queries. The corresponding gene is substantially upregulated in NLB and in HBA. In this instance, as in many others mentioned above, a role in lignocellulose degradation, if any, requires additional biochemical and/or genetic analysis. Consideration of gene structure, transcriptional regulation, and protein secretion provides a filter for focusing on the more promising targets.This study was supported by National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, grant 2007-35504-18257 to the Forest Products Laboratory; by U.S. Department of Energy grant DE-FG02-87ER13712 to the University of Wisconsin-Madison; and by National Institutes of Health grant GM060201 to the University of New Mexico.▿Published ahead of print on 17 April 2009.†Supplemental material for this article may be found at http://aem.asm.org/."
PMC2709373,Coordinate Regulation of Glycan Degradation and Polysaccharide Capsule Biosynthesis by a Prominent Human Gut Symbiont*,False,"Bacteria in the distal human gut have evolved diverse abilities to metabolize complex glycans, including the capacity to degrade these compounds as nutrients and to assemble their component sugars into new polymers such as extracellular capsules. The human gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is well endowed with the ability to metabolize both host- and diet-derived glycans. Its genome contains 88 different polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) for complex glycan catabolism and eight different gene clusters for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis. Here, we investigate one of the prominent mechanisms by which this gut symbiont regulates many PULs involved in host mucin O-glycan degradation; namely, transcriptional regulation via the concerted interactions of cell-envelope-localized TonB-dependent transporters, extra-cytoplasmic function σ factors and anti-σ factors, which participate together in a regulatory pathway termed trans-envelope signaling. Unexpectedly, we found that several different trans-envelope signaling switches involved in PUL-mediated O-glycan degradation also modulate capsular polysaccharide synthesis. A novel regulatory pathway, which is dependent on expression of O-glycan-targeting outer membrane proteins, governs this coordinated regulation of glycan catabolism and capsule synthesis. This latter finding provides a new link in the dynamic interplay between complex glycan metabolism, microbial physiology, and host responses that occurs during colonization of the gut.The adult human distal gut is home to a microbial consortium (microbiota) that plays critical roles in nutrient digestion (1). This community of ∼10–100 trillion microbes is generally dominated by two bacterial divisions (phyla), the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes, and harbors a collective genome, the microbiome, that is several orders of magnitude larger than the human genome (2–4). An important function encoded within the microbiome is production of degradative enzymes that target the chemically diverse pool of complex glycans that are constantly inundating the gut. Because many of the complex dietary polysaccharides that we consume transit our proximal gastrointestinal tract intact, these glycan degrading (glycolytic) activities augment human digestive physiology by providing catabolic functions we have not evolved. Thus, the microbiota allows us to assimilate otherwise indigestible dietary nutrients, and it is probable that competition for these nutrients is a major factor that shapes the composition and metabolism of this community (2).In addition to being glycan consumers, many members of the microbiota possess the ability to synthesize new polysaccharides de novo. Many of these newly synthesized molecules take the form of secreted capsular polysaccharides, composed of myriad sugars combined via an array of glycosidic linkages. Some gut bacteria have the ability to reversibly alter their capsule composition, and this phenomenon is important for evasion of host adaptive immunity (5, 6). Expression of the zwitterionic capsular polysaccharide A from the human gut symbiont Bacteroides fragilis reduces the host immune response toward pathogenic bacteria by suppressing inflammatory pathways (7). Bacterial production of capsular polysaccharides is associated with increased resistance to phage, complement, and antimicrobial peptides (8–10). Extracellular polysaccharides are mediators of bacterial interactions with both other microbes and biotic/abiotic surfaces during the process of biofilm formation (11). Thus, variable expression of capsular polysaccharides is a trait that likely influences the dynamic relationship between microbiota members as well as how some of these species interact with their hosts.Among the species prominently represented in the distal gut microbiota, members of the Bacteroidetes are particularly adept at degrading a variety of glycans present in our diet (starches, fructans, pectins, and hemicelluloses) and in the gut mucosa (O- and N-linked glycans and glycosaminoglycans) (12). Comparative and functional genomic studies in several Bacteroidetes species have revealed that these Gram-negative bacteria deploy similar sets of extracellular proteins, termed Sus-like systems, to bind and degrade diverse glycan structures (13, 14). Sus-like systems are encoded by polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs)3; these clusters ubiquitously encode homologs of a TonB-dependent oligosaccharide transporter (SusC) and an outer membrane lipoprotein (SusD) involved in glycan binding and also typically encode glycolytic enzymes (i.e. glycoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases, and carbohydrate esterases) (15). Molecular genetic analyses of several PULs in the human gut symbiont, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, have confirmed that these systems are subject to activation via a variety of different transcription factors, which respond to the monosaccharide content and linkage information contained in glycans that they target as growth substrates (14, 16). Thus, we hypothesize that each Bacteroidetes Sus-like system is a regulated, substrate-specific system for targeting a distinct glycan. The presence of dozens of systems in each species equips it to handle many different complex carbohydrate substrates (13).B. thetaiotaomicron dedicates ∼18% of its 6.26-Mb genome to 88 individual PULs. In a recent study involving gnotobiotic mice, we determined that a subset of these loci are deployed during foraging on host mucin O-glycans (14). This attribute enables B. thetaiotaomicron to persist in the distal intestine when dietary glycan intake is scarce and also to be transmitted from a mother to her newborn pups when they consume a milk diet that is naturally devoid of complex, difficult to digest dietary polysaccharides. B. thetaiotaomicron expresses at least 16 different PULs in response to mucin O-glycans, and at least some of these systems are transcriptionally activated by chemically distinct glycosidic cues that may exist within the same glycan molecule (e.g. the disaccharides Gal-β1,3-GalNAc or Gal-β1,4-GlcNAc). The need to recognize the many different linkages and sugar combinations present in O-glycans may explain much of the seeming redundancy in PUL expression toward these substrates, which are composed of five principal monosaccharides that can be linked together into dozens of different heterogeneous structures (17), each of which could be recognized by a different PUL.A second notable feature of the response of B. thetaiotaomicron to mucin O-glycans is transcriptional activation of PULs by extra-cytoplasmic function σ (ECF-σ) factor/anti-σ factor pairs. To date, this class of regulators has not been implicated in controlling PULs that target any other class of glycans (14). These transcription factors are predicted to form a signal transduction pathway by coupling with specialized SusC-like proteins (“signal transducing SusC-like transporters”) that import mucin-derived oligosaccharides into the periplasm (Fig. 1A). Upon recognition of substrate by a signal transducing SusC-like transporter, these three proteins are thought to work together to activate PUL transcription via a mechanism termed “trans-envelope signaling”; protein contacts made in both the periplasm (transporter/anti-σ interaction) and at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane (anti-σ/ECF-σ interaction) transduce a signal across the entire bacterial cell envelope that results in activation of the ECF-σ transcription factor (18).Positive feedback model of PUL regulation. A, schematic of a hypothetical Sus-like system regulated by trans-envelope signaling and the PUL at which it is encoded (note that gene number and enzyme content is variable between different PULs). The left half of the Fig. illustrates the sequence of events leading to system priming in the “off” signaling state: (i) initial expression of ECF-σ (green) from a housekeeping σAB promoter (dashed arrow with a black circular base) results in a small amount of PUL gene expression via the ECF-σ-dependent transcript; (ii) simultaneous production of anti-σ (red), which physically interacts with both the SusC-like transporter (purple) and the cytoplasmic ECF-σ, causes the system to be held in the default off state unless glycan substrates are present. The right half illustrates events leading to amplified expression (“on” state) of the Sus-like system: (i) a cognate substrate (e.g. mucin O-glycan) is bound and then transported through the transducing SusC-like transporter; (ii) substrate transport initiates an allosteric signal that is transmitted from the SusC-like protein to the anti-σ factor via periplasmic contacts and then to the ECF-σ factor via cytoplasmic contacts; (iii) propagation of the trans-envelope signal results in ECF-σ activation and increased expression of the ECF-σ-dependent promoter(s) (dashed arrow with a green circular base) located upstream of nearby genes encoding structural and enzymatic components of the Sus-like system. B, comparison of induction levels for 12 trans-envelope signaling systems that respond to host glycans. The -fold induction (plotted on the y axis) relative to MM-glucose is shown for genes encoding ECF-σ factors (green data points), anti-σ factors (red data points), transducing SusC-like proteins (purple data points), and SusD-like proteins (orange data points) from 12 different PULs that are regulated by trans-envelope signaling. Data points represent individual genes, and horizontal black bars represent average -fold induction for each gene class in GeneChip expression experiments. The y axis is shown on log10 scale to allow visualization of differences in ECF-σ expression.These putative trans-envelope signaling switches would operate in a manner analogous to the ferric dicitrate (Fec) signaling system of Escherichia coli (18). However, the number of these putative trans-envelope signaling switches in B. thetaiotaomicron is extraordinarily large; i.e. the ferric dicitrate system is uniquely represented in E. coli, whereas B. thetaiotaomicron has 26 such systems. We previously found that B. thetaiotaomicron activates at least 12 of its 26 putative switches in the presence of mucin O-glycan components, raising two key questions about how this signal transduction mechanism integrates the information contained in extracellular O-glycans. First, do simultaneously activated systems act exclusively of one another to sense various O-glycans, or can cross-talk occur between systems? Second, do trans-envelope signaling switches exert global effects on the B. thetaiotaomicron transcriptome that extend beyond regulation of the local PUL genes to which they are linked?In this report we explore each of these questions about how B. thetaiotaomicron mobilizes its various “utensils” for dining on glycans available in its host habitat through a series of molecular genetic and biochemical experiments. Our results validate the proposed trans-envelope signaling mechanism and reveal that only minor amounts of cross-talk occur between simultaneously active switches. We also show for several different sensory systems that B. thetaiotaomicron coordinates its glycan catabolism and capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis. Thus, a component of this species adaptation to life in the gut is co-regulation of nutrient intake and surface antigenicity, a finding that sheds light in the quest to understand the elaborate web of interactions between our diet, our gut microbiota, and our human physiology.Bacterial strains and plasmids are summarized in supplemental Table S1. B. thetaiotaomicron was routinely grown in Tryptone-yeast extract-glucose medium (19) or on brain-heart infusion (BD Biosciences) agar supplemented with 10% horse blood (Colorado Serum Co.). Antibiotics were added as appropriate: erythromycin (25 μg ml−1), gentamicin (200 μg ml−1), tetracycline (2 μg ml−1), and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (200 μg ml−1). Minimal medium (MM)-glucose cultures were grown as previously described in either test tubes or in a batch fermentor (5-ml and 800-ml culture volumes, respectively) (14). B. thetaiotaomicron mutant strains were constructed by either suicide plasmid insertion (denoted as Ω mutants) or by unmarked gene deletion (denoted as Δ mutants). Each method was used exactly as described in previous publications (14, 20).Transcriptional profiling was performed using custom Affymetrix GeneChips containing probesets representing >98% of 4779 predicted protein-coding genes in the B. thetaiotaomicron genome (21). GeneChip targets were prepared from whole bacterial RNA (15) and hybridized to the microarrays according to standard Affymetrix protocols. Data were normalized using Microarray Suite 5 software (Affymetrix) and processed using GeneSpringGX 7.3.1 software (Agilent) according to a previously described workflow (14), except that -fold change cutoffs of 2.5 and 5 were used as indicated in the analyses reported in this work. All GeneChip data used in this study are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Further details concerning bacterial growth conditions, experimental parameters, and the GEO accession numbers for each experiment are provided in supplemental Table S2. In addition to the software and analysis described above, we also used the program DNA-Chip Analyzer (dChip) software (22) to generate the heatmap image shown in supplemental Fig. S4.Additional measurement of transcript levels was performed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR using a Stratagene Mx3000P machine, previously described reaction conditions (15), and the primers listed in supplemental Table S3. In all cases, transcript abundance was assayed at 78 °C.Protein interactions between trans-envelope signaling components were probed by yeast two-hybrid assay using the Matchmaker Library Construction kit (BD Biosciences), the manufacturer's instructions, and the oligonucleotides described in supplemental Table S3. Sequences encoding either the N-terminal domains of signal-transducing SusC paralogs or the entire ECF-σ controlled by trans-envelope signaling, were ligated in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the vector pGBKT7. Sequences encoding either the N- or C-terminal domains of anti-σ factors were ligated in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain in the vector pGADT7-rec. Fusion vectors were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae test strain AH109 and selected on medium lacking l-leucine and l-tryptophan (Leu-, Trp-), which corresponds to the nutritional selection genes present in pGBKT7 and pGADT7-rec, respectively. Strains containing potentially interacting fusion proteins were screened on synthetic defined medium lacking l-leucine, l-tryptophan, adenine, and l-histidine (Leu-, Trp-, Ade-, His-), which imposes the additional requirement of interaction between GAL4 activation and binding domain fusion proteins to recover adenine and l-histidine prototrophy. Identical cell suspensions were replica-plated onto both types of media, and growth was scored after incubation for 2 days at 30 °C.Capsular polysaccharides were extracted from wild-type and mutant strains grown in a 1.2-liter Bioflo 110 batch fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific; 800 ml culture volumes in MM-glucose (5)). Briefly, cultures were grown to mid-log phase (A600 for three biological replicates were 0.60, 0.59, and 0.62 for wild type; 0.60, 0.63, 0.61 for ΩBT3992, and 0.73, 0.76, and 0.73 for a ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2 double mutant). Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min and immediately frozen at −80 °C. Each cell pellet was thawed by the addition of 50 ml of warm water. Phenol (90% w/w; 50 ml) was then added, and the mixture was held at 65 °C with gentle stirring for 1 h followed by incubation at 4 °C overnight. The extraction mixture was subsequently centrifuged at 1600 × g for 20 min to separate the aqueous and phenol phases, and the aqueous phase was collected and dialyzed (1-kDa cutoff) exhaustively against deionized distilled water. Dialyzed samples were lyophilized to dryness and dissolved in 20 ml of boiling double distilled H2O followed by continuous agitation overnight at 4 °C. Samples were subjected to two consecutive rounds of centrifugation to remove insoluble particulates, the first at 7,000 × g for 20 min and the second at 150,000 × g in an ultracentrifuge for 4 h (both steps at 4 °C). Finally, the cleared sample was lyophilized and dissolved in hot (95 °C) double distilled H2O at a concentration of 10 mg ml−1.Neutral and acidic sugars were assayed in extracellular polysaccharide samples by high pH anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) after acid hydrolysis of the samples in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid (100 °C for 4 h). Thirteen individual peaks corresponding to different sugars were distinguished under the conditions used. Nine of these eluted identically to known standards, whereas four did not behave like any of the standards examined (fucose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, glucose, mannose, galacturonic acid, glucuronic acid, and iduronic acid). Because both of the unknown monosaccharides that were abundant in CPS2 eluted similarly to acidic sugar standards, we also ran a sample of acid-hydrolyzed alginic acid, which is composed of mannuronic and guluronic acids. The presence of N-acetylgalactosamine and N-acetylglucosamine, which were deacetylated during acid hydrolysis, was inferred from the presence of galactosamine and glucosamine, respectively.For India ink staining, B. thetaiotaomicron strains were grown to late exponential phase in MM-glucose (A600 values were 1.10, 1.16, and 1.04 for wild type, 1.10, 1.22, and 0.87 for ΩBT3992, and 1.10, 1.19, and 0.75 for ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2). A 20-μl aliquot of the fresh culture was mixed gently on a slide with an equivalent amount of India ink (Higgins Ink), a cover glass was added, and a paper towel was firmly pressed over the slide to blot away extra liquid. Cells were imaged at 630× magnification by phase contrast microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop 2 MOT plus). Capsule measurements were determined from micrographs using ImageJ 1.40g software (rsb.info.nih.gov). A total of 150 individual cells were measured for each bacterial strain analyzed, 50 from each of the three individual experiments. Four measurements were made per cell and averaged to generate a single average capsule width.Samples for quick-freeze, deep-etch scanning electron microscopy were taken from fresh MM-glucose cultures grown to similar points in late exponential phase as for the India Ink staining experiments (A600 values of 1.2, 1.0, and 1.2 for wild type, ΩBT3992 and ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2). Samples were processed and imaged according to previously described methods (23–25). Briefly, a 5-ml suspension of the culture was gently centrifuged, and the resulting bacterial pellet was layered onto a thin slice of aldehyde-fixed rat lung (used for support during freezing). The pellet was put onto a liquid helium-cooled copper block in a homemade “Cryopress” quick-freeze machine. The frozen pellet was then freeze-fractured in a standard Balzer's freeze etching unit and immediately “deep-etched” for 2 min at −104 °C. The specimen was then rotary-replicated with ∼2 nm of platinum applied from an angle of 20° above the horizontal and “backed” with a ∼10-nm film of pure carbon. Replicas were separated from the bacteria by brief floatation on a solution of 3–6% sodium hypochlorite (as household bleach) and finally washed several times in double distilled H2O before being picked up on 75-mesh Formvar-coated microscope grids. Replicas were viewed in a JEOL transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV and photographed at 50,000× initial magnification.The start of the BT1053 transcript was mapped using the 5′-RACE system for rapid amplification of transcript ends kit (Invitrogen) and a mixture of total cellular RNA purified from B. thetaiotaomicron grown in MM-glucose and MM-neutral O-glycans. The kit employs terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase to add a polydeoxycytidine sequence to the 5′ ends of transcripts before PCR amplification using a gene-specific primer and a universal primer complementary to polydeoxycytidine. Therefore, we were unable to identify the precise transcriptional start site for BT1053 due to the possibility that this transcript may have initiated at a cytidine residue. However, we mapped the probable transcription start site to within two possible initiating nucleotides (see supplemental Fig. S1 for details).Deduced protein sequences for the ORFs described in supplemental Fig. S2 were aligned using ClustalW in the MegaAlign component of the Lasergene software package (DNAStar). Signal sequences and transmembrane helices were predicted using the programs SignalP and Toppred, respectively (26, 27).As noted in the Introduction, our previous custom GeneChip-based, whole genome transcriptional profiling of B. thetaiotaomicron grown in a variety of MM formulations containing purified host glycans revealed that this species expresses at least 12 PULs that are coupled to ECF-σ/anti-σ trans-envelope signaling switches to catabolize mucin O-glycans (herein referred to as “O-glycans”) (14). When we analyzed individual gene expression patterns in these PULs, we noted that the ECF-σ gene associated with each locus did not exhibit similarly increased levels of transcription as the remaining genes in the cluster; during bacterial growth under conditions that resulted in maximum expression of each PUL, the ECF-σ genes in these 12 loci only exhibited an average induction of 1.8-fold (Fig. 1B). In contrast, genes encoding the anti-σ, SusC-, and SusD-like proteins associated with these same 12 systems exhibited average induction values of 21-, 119-, and 150-fold, respectively. Thus, the host glycan components that stimulate each of these systems do not equivalently influence ECF-σ expression, suggesting that these transcription factors are not auto-regulated and may be transcribed by RNA polymerase containing a different σ factor. Coupled with the mechanistic model of transcriptional control postulated for trans-envelope signaling (see the Introduction and Fig. 1A), this observation suggests a positive feedback loop in which expression of each PUL-encoded Sus-like system is “primed” by housekeeping σ factor-directed transcription of the coupled ECF-σ gene. In other words, a consistent amount of each ECF-σ is expressed from each locus and subsequently activates expression of both the associated anti-σ factor and the structural and enzymatic functions involved in glycan processing. In the absence of an inducing glycan, a small amount of each system is produced in an “off” state. When a glycan is recognized by a particular SusC-like transporter, a trans-envelope signal is sent that results in PUL activation and an amplified catabolic response toward the target glycan from which the transported saccharide was derived. Thus, by constitutively producing small amounts of each Sus-like system, B. thetaiotaomicron constantly surveys its environment for the various glycans that these systems recognize, equipping the cell to generate a rapid response upon substrate detection.To determine whether PUL-associated ECF-σ genes are indeed expressed from “housekeeping” promoters, we mapped the transcription start site of one such gene, BT1053, that is associated with a single, O-glycan-inducible PUL (BT1032–53). Transcription of this gene is initiated downstream of a promoter containing just 1-bp difference relative to the −7/−33 consensus established for the primary σ-factor, σAB, previously identified in Bacteroides species (28). Similar putative promoter sequences were identified upstream of 24 of 26 ECF-σ genes examined (supplemental Fig. S1A). In conjunction with the expression data described above, this finding supports the model that expression of each ECF-σ-regulated Sus-like system is indeed primed by housekeeping transcription. Moreover, we were able to locate examples of similar σAB promoter sequences upstream of several other classes of PUL-associated transcriptional activators (supplemental Fig. S1B), suggesting that expression of other Sus-like systems may be primed in a similar way as those controlled by trans-envelope signaling.Trans-envelope signaling has not been investigated in an organism such as B. thetaiotaomicron that harbors multiple different systems that may be simultaneously activated within the same cell (18). Therefore, we first sought to define the signaling specificities of multiple trans-envelope signaling systems as well as to validate the signaling mechanism of at least one individual system.The predicted physical interactions between trans-envelope signaling protein components were examined for five ECF-σ-linked PULs that are simultaneously expressed at high levels in the distal guts of gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with B. thetaiotaomicron (14). A matrix of 50 different protein interactions were assayed for the 5 selected systems; 25 possible combinations for the SusC-like transporter/anti-σ interaction, which occurs in the periplasm, and 25 possible combinations for anti-σ/ECF-σ interaction, which occurs in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). All 10 cognate interactions (i.e. those between protein components from the same PUL) were detected by yeast two-hybrid analysis. However, none of the remaining 20 non-cognate interactions was detected between periplasmic signaling partners, whereas just 4 non-cognate interactions were detected between cytoplasmic signaling partners. Thus, we were able to demonstrate protein interactions between both periplasmic and cytoplasmic signaling partners, and these interactions appear to be largely system-specific. Despite the evidence for signaling cross-talk provided by four non-cognate cytoplasmic interactions, additional experiments described below in which individual ECF-σ regulons were artificially activated via anti-σ mutation suggest that these non-cognate interactions between cytoplasmic signaling components do not result in biologically relevant cross-talk between PUL regulators.Protein interactions between trans-envelope signaling components. A, yeast two-hybrid assays of interactions between periplasmic trans-envelope signaling components (SusC-like protein N-terminal transducing domains and anti-σ C-terminal domains). B, yeast two-hybrid assays of interactions between cytoplasmic trans-envelope signaling components (ECF-σ factors and anti-σ N-terminal domains). Each grid represents a matrix of 25 different interactions tested for each signaling node. Panels on the left show growth of all possible interacting pairs under non-selective conditions that do not require protein interactions (Leu-, Trp-). Panels on the right show replicate growths of the same interacting partners shown on the left but under selective conditions (Leu-, Trp-, Ade-, His-); colony growth under this condition indicates protein interaction in the assay. Cognate interactions are highlighted with red circles, and non-cognate interactions are highlighted with blue circles. Gene names at the top and left of columns/rows indicate the source genes tested. The precise coding sequences used for yeast two-hybrid partner fusions are illustrated in supplemental Fig. S2. Colony growth was photographed after 2 days of growth at 30 °C.To further test the model of glycan-induced trans-envelope signaling proposed in Fig. 1A, we constructed a series of mutants in the genes encoding signaling components of one O-glycan-induced PUL (BT1032–53; see Fig. 3A for a map of this locus) and evaluated the effects of these perturbations on the ability of this PUL to be activated in response to O-glycans (Fig. 3B). This PUL was chosen for mechanistic analysis because it is highly induced in vitro in response to neutral O-glycans (14), which can be purified in abundance from porcine gastric mucosa, and because the system's anti-σ gene (BT1052) was not positioned upstream of the signal transducing susC-like transporter. This latter point is critical because it allowed construction of a plasmid insertion mutant in the anti-σ gene (BT1052) without the possibility of introducing polar effects on downstream genes that might also be involved in signaling.Molecular genetic analysis of trans-envelope signaling. A, schematic of the BT1032–53 PUL, which is induced in response to mucin O-glycans. Key genes that were subjected to mutational analysis are indicated with locus tag numbers, and all genes are labeled according to the key provided in Fig. 1; white boxes in this schematic represent genes with annotated functions other than those indicated in Fig. 1. B, a histogram showing the responses of 22 genes contained within the BT1032–53 PUL to different growth and/or bacterial genetic backgrounds. For wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron grown in a preparation of neutral O-glycans (14), most genes in this PUL show increased expression relative to a MM-glucose reference (yellow bars). Individual disruptions of genes encoding either the signal transducing SusC-like protein (BT1042, purple bars) or the ECF-σ associated with this system (BT1053, green bars) result in nearly complete loss of PUL activation during growth in the neutral O-glycan mixture. Conversely, de-repression of the trans-envelope signaling switch via anti-σ mutation (red bars) results in PUL expression during growth on glucose as a sole carbon source, which does not ordinarily cause induction of these genes. Values are based on normalized GeneChip expression data. Bars indicate -fold changes in expression relative to duplicate reference datasets derived from 5-ml cultures grown in MM-glucose. All bars represent the average response of each gene in two replicate datasets.Growth of wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron in MM containing neutral O-glycans stimulated expression of this locus; all genes between BT1032 and BT1053, with the exception of an annotated integrase/tyrosine recombinase (BT1041), showed induction, suggesting that they are controlled by ECF-σBT1053. In contrast to wild type (yellow bars in Fig. 3B), two different mutants, a deletion of the ECF-σ gene BT1053 and a plasmid insertion in the signal transducing susC-like gene BT1042, eliminated the ability of this system to be induced during growth on neutral O-glycans (green and purple bars in Fig. 3B). Neither of these mutants exhibited noticeably altered growth rates in vitro when using neutral O-glycans as the sole carbon source, suggesting that redundancy in the B. thetaiotaomicron ability to use this host-derived substrate may compensate for loss of this one Sus-like system (data not shown).To test whether the signaling defect observed with the BT1042 insertion mutant was due to specific loss of BT1042 or the result of a polar effect that silences the downstream genes (BT1043–45), we made a plasmid insertion in the adjacent downstream gene in the operon (BT1043) and evaluated the ability of this PUL to undergo normal activation. In response to neutral O-glycans, the ΩBT1043 mutant exhibited normal activation of “probe” genes in this PUL (BT1040 and BT1046) to levels that were similar to, or slightly greater than wild type (supplemental Fig. S3). Moreover, complementation of ΩBT1042 in trans with a wild-type copy of BT1042, but not the downstream BT1043–45 genes, restored induction of PUL genes to levels that were similar to wild type (data not shown). Thus, the only product of this operon required for signal transduction is BT1042. Together, these results demonstrate that the specialized TonB-dependent transporter associated with this system (BT1042) is required to propagate a signal that results in gene activation. The effect of this signal is ultimately mediated through a cognate transcription factor, ECF-σBT1053, which also needs to be present to activate PUL gene expression.Multiple Sus-like systems involved in O-glycan catabolism, including the BT1032–53 system, are simultaneously expressed both in vitro during growth on O-glycans and in vivo in the distal mouse gut (14). The genetic experiments described above demonstrate that the trans-envelope signaling switch encoded within the BT1032–53 PUL is essential for its regulation. We also wished to determine whether loss of the positive-acting components of this particular trans-envelope signaling switch (BT1042 and BT1053) influenced other cellular responses to O-glycans, such as expression of other PULs. Therefore, we individually profiled our BT1042 and BT1053 mutants in MM-neutral O-glycans to see if loss of one trans-envelope signaling switch influenced expression of other PULs. As described in the supplemental material, expression of only one of nine PULs that were highly expressed in MM-neutral O-glycans was diminished in the BT1042 and BT1053 signaling mutants, and this was the BT1032–53 PUL to which these genes belonged (supplemental Fig. S4).Our model predicts that active signaling from BT1042 through ECF-σBT1053 proceeds through the inner membrane-spanning anti-σBT1052. In the absence of O-glycans, this anti-σ should act as a repressor of ECF-σBT1053 and, upon O-glycan recognition, transmit the signal it receives from BT1042 to ECF-σBT1053, resulting in release of its transcriptional activity. Thus, inactivation of the anti-σBT1052 repressor should result in constitutive expression of genes controlled by ECF-σBT1053. Experiments with the E. coli ferric dicitrate (Fec) system have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of the anti-σFecR is initially required for ECF-σFecI maturation (29). With these thoughts in mind, we constructed a plasmid insertion mutant in BT1052 that resulted in a C-terminal truncation of the anti-σ gene (see supplemental Fig. S2B for the precise point of truncation). This mutant is expected to still express the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of anti-σBT1052 required for ECF-σBT1053 maturation but is lacking the periplasmic domain required for coupling with SusCBT1042 in the periplasm. As anticipated, GeneChip profiling of this mutant during growth on glucose as a sole carbon source revealed expression of genes within the BT1032–53 PUL, even though no inducing O-glycans were present (red bars in Fig. 3B). This ability to artificially de-repress individual trans-envelope signaling switches in the absence of an external inducing glycan allowed us to probe the breadth of the signaling regulon associated with each system.To define select trans-envelope signaling system transcriptional regulons, we constructed a series of five individual anti-σ factor disruptions aimed at causing de-repression of genes activated by each ECF-σ. The five disrupted anti-σ genes are components of the same five systems analyzed above by yeast two-hybrid analysis: BT1052, BT1618, BT3992, BT4356, and BT4249/BT4248 (the latter gene was originally annotated as two distinct divergent ORFs but was later confirmed to undergo site-specific recombination to generate a single full-length anti-σ gene (14); because the upstream BT4249 ORF was specifically targeted, this mutant is referred to as ΩBT4249).Each anti-σ gene was disrupted using a plasmid insertion strategy that resulted in a truncated anti-σ gene and native expression of the 5′ end of the ORF, which encodes the cytoplasmic domain (truncation points are indicated in supplemental Fig. S2B). Each of the targeted anti-σ genes had previously exhibited increased expression during activation of its O-glycan-responsive PUL (Fig. 1B). Thus, we initially verified the effectiveness of our anti-σ disruptions by confirming induction of the remaining 5′ region of each gene using quantitative PCR. In each of the five mutant strains, anti-σ gene expression was increased 11–387-fold during growth in MM-glucose when compared with wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron, suggesting successful derepression (data not shown). Three mutants (ΩBT1618, ΩBT4249, and ΩBT4356), in which the disrupted anti-σ gene resides immediately upstream and in the same orientation as the adjacent sus-like genes, resulted in apparent polar effects on their downstream genes. This phenomenon, which was indicated by reduced or absent expression of downstream genes relative to the MM-glucose reference, was not anticipated due to the relatively large intergenic regions between the disrupted anti-σ and downstream sus-like genes (51, 114, and 161 bp). Nevertheless, it prohibited us from directly observing induction of the downstream genes.To identify genes in the individual regulons associated with each of the trans-envelope signaling switches, we used our custom B. thetaiotaomicron GeneChips to generate whole-genome transcriptional profiles for each mutant strain as well as for the reference isogenic wild-type control. Each strain was grown to mid-exponential phase in MM-glucose, a condition that does not stimulate expression of any of these systems in wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron (three replicates were performed per strain; absorbance values at which cultures were harvested are provided in supplemental Table S2). Compared with wild type, a total of 295 genes exhibited expression changes ≥2.5-fold in 1 or more of the 5 different anti-σ mutants; 221 of these genes had higher expression than wild type, whereas 74 had lower expression (summarized in Table 1; for complete gene lists, plus -fold change values and their statistical significance, see supplemental Table S4). In the case of the two anti-σ disruptions where polar effects on downstream genes were not observed (ΩBT1052 and ΩBT3992), we were able to confirm increased expression of genes within the immediately adjacent PUL. Based on (i) autoregulation of the 5′ regions of the three anti-σ genes for which polarity was observed and (ii) previous evidence linking the ECF-σ genes associated with these three systems to PUL activation (14), we infer that similar regulation of adjacent genes also occurs in these systems.Summary of genes with >2.5-fold expression changes in anti-σ mutantsa Note that these categories are not mutually exclusive.b These anti-σ disruptions were polar on downstream Sus-like outer membrane components. Therefore, they do not show de-repression of these linked PUL components. For a gene list, see supplemental Table S4.Beyond regulation of adjacent PUL genes, other transcriptional changes were detected, especially in the non-polar BT1052 and BT3992 mutants (Table 1). These responses included induction of glycolytic functions that were not immediately linked to the PULs analyzed; a total of 12 genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes (as defined in the CAZy data base (30)) were up-regulated, and 9 of these belonged to CAZy families with known relevance to O-glycan catabolism (Table 2). Thus, activation of individual ECF-σ regulons results in expression of glycan degrading functions that may augment the effectiveness of each PUL in substrate processing. Although we could not determine whether the activated ECF-σ factors directly or indirectly influence expression of these genes, the fact that their regulation occurs in MM-glucose medium reveals that their expression is linked to activation of the trans-envelope signaling switch per se and not to the sensing of glycan products liberated during O-glycan processing.Induction of CAZy functions that are unlinked to de-repressed PULsActivities that are relevant to mucin O-glycan degradation are shown in bold.In addition to glycan degrading functions, some regulation of unlinked PUL genes was also observed (Table 1 and Fig. 4A). This phenomenon was most striking in the ΩBT3992 mutant, which caused up-regulation of genes in two different PULs. One PUL (BT0206–14) is not conspicuously paired with its own regulator. However, a second PUL (BT4403–07) is associated with its own ECF-σ/anti-σ gene pair, BT4402 and BT4403, respectively, and is likely regulated by its own dedicated trans-envelope signaling switch (the ECF-σ gene BT4402 is not listed with this PUL in Fig. 4 because it does not exhibit induction). Experiments described below suggest that the likely mechanism of increased BT4403–07 expression is via ECF-σBT3993 interaction with the BT4403–07 promoter(s) rather than anti-σBT3992 maturation of ECF-σBT4402 (i.e. cross-activation occurs at the level of ECF-σ/promoter and not via anti-σ/ECF-σ interactions). However, it is important to note that the average induction of the BT4403–07 PUL genes was only 16-fold in ΩBT3992 (-fold change values determined from normalized GeneChip intensities), whereas genes in the cognate BT3983–88 locus were up-regulated 336-fold in the same strain and dataset (supplemental Table S4).Other loci regulated by ECF-σ factors. A heatmap illustrating the transcriptional responses of genes in two PULs, BT0206–14 and BT4403–07 (A), and five B. thetaiotaomicron CPS synthesis loci (B) to mutation of five individual anti-σ factors and consequent de-repression of their corresponding ECF-σ-dependent regulons. Responses of individual genes within the locus tag range noted for each cluster are shown and are based on -fold change values determined from GeneChip datasets. Three biological replicates were performed for each anti-σ mutant and -fold changes quantified by referencing each gene to the average expression values observed in three datasets obtained from wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron grown in MM-glucose. -Fold change values are calibrated to the color bar shown at the right. Note that each of the PULs shown in panel A exhibits a specific response to disruption of anti-σBT3992, which activates ECF-σBT3993 but not other regulators. Also, four different CPS loci (CPS8, CPS1, CPS2, and CPS3) are activated differently in the various anti-σ mutants. One locus, CPS4, exhibits transcriptional repression under two conditions. Three remaining B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 capsule loci (CPS5–7), which did not respond to any of the conditions tested, are not shown.An unanticipated phenomenon was observed for all but one of the de-repressed ECF-σ regulons analyzed; artificial activation of these systems by anti-σ disruption in MM-glucose medium resulted in altered expression of some of the eight CPS gene clusters contained in B. thetaiotaomicron. These responses compose the largest class of regulated genes that are unlinked to the five trans-envelope signaling switches that we analyzed (Table 1). The B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 type strain encodes 8 distinct CPS loci, each containing 15–32 genes that catalyze the transformation of activated precursor sugars (e.g. a nucleoside diphosphate-glucose), into various sugar derivatives, which are subsequently secreted and linked together to form a capsule (31, 32). Independent disruptions of four different anti-σ genes (BT1052, BT1618, BT3992, and BT4356) resulted in increased expression of four different CPS gene clusters (CPS8, CPS1, CPS2,and CPS3; Fig. 4B). Moreover, disruption of BT3992 and BT4356 resulted in reduced expression of CPS4, which ordinarily is the most highly expressed locus during in vitro growth and growth in vivo when dietary plant glycans are present (15, 21). Complementation of the ΩBT1052 mutant with a wild-type copy of BT1052, expressed under its native promoter, reduced expression of the two CPS loci (CPS8 and CPS1) that were activated in this mutant back to wild-type levels (Table 1 and supplemental Table S4), demonstrating that anti-σ disruption is causal to the observed CPS expression phenomenon.To further investigate the effects on capsule production, we selected the ΩBT3992 mutant for subsequent studies because it had the largest impact on capsule gene expression, an average 84-fold induction of the 21 genes comprising CPS2 (supplemental Table S4; -fold-change values were determined from normalized GeneChip intensities). We first analyzed extracellular capsule size in this mutant using two different techniques, standard light microscopy with India ink staining and quick- freeze, deep-etch scanning electron microscopy. Capsule width was measured in India ink-stained samples of wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron and compared with both the ΩBT3992 mutant and a ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2 double mutant (Fig. 5A); in this latter strain, ECF-σBT3993 was de-repressed, but the 21 genes comprising CPS2 were also deleted. The ΩBT3992 mutant, the only strain that retained elevated CPS2 expression, exhibited a significant increase in capsule size (average capsule width was 1.4 times greater than wild-type and 1.5 times greater than the ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2 double mutant; p values were 2.8e−27 and 6.8e−43, respectively, according to Student's t test; n = 150 individual cells scored/strain).Capsule production by the ΩBT3992 mutant. A, histogram plot of capsule sizes determined by India ink staining of the isogenic wild-type (black bars), ΩBT3992 (red bars), and the ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2 double mutant (gray bars) strains. Capsule sizes from a total of 150 individual cells were measured for each strain, 50 from each of three different experiments. p values are provided above the ΩBT3992 distribution and are color-coded based on the dataset (wild-type or double mutant) to which the ΩBT3992 distribution was compared. Representative images of India ink-stained encapsulated cells are provided in supplemental Fig. S5. B, quick-freeze, deep-etch scanning electron micrographs of wild-type and ΩBT3992 and ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2 double mutant cells, illustrating their capsule morphology. The capsule appears thicker in the ΩBT3992 mutant but of similar density as the other two strains. The width of each capsule (c) is indicated by a yellow line. The bacterial cell (b), inner membrane (im), and outer membrane (om) are labeled for reference. Magnification is 50,000×. C, analysis of monosaccharides present in wild-type and ΩBT3992 and ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2 double mutant capsules. A total of 13 different sugars were differentiated by HPAEC-PAD; nine of these eluted at the same time as known monosaccharide standards (see labels above histogram bars), whereas four compounds (labeled as unknown 1–4) did not correspond to any known standards used. Note the abundance of two uniquely represented and unknown sugars (unknowns 3 and 4) in the ΩBT3992 capsule. Total extracellular polysaccharides were extracted from cells grown in MM-glucose, and three biological replicates were performed for each strain. Values shown represent the average -fold increase of each sugar relative to the average present in wild-type cells, and error bars represent the S.D. Instances where sugar abundance in the ΩBT3992 mutant differed significantly from wild-type are indicated with asterisks (*, p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01 by Student's t test). Histogram bars are arranged along the x axis based on their elution points under the HPAEC-PAD conditions used (negative charge increases toward the right side of the graph). Representative HPAEC-PAD traces are provided in supplemental Fig. S6. Fuc, fucose; GalA, galacturonic acid; GlcA, glucuronic acid; IdoA, iduronic acid.To gain a higher resolution view of the capsules expressed by these strains, we also examined their structures by quick-freeze, deep-etch scanning electron microscopy (Figs. 5B). Scanning electron microscopy micrographs confirmed the increased capsule size in the ΩBT3992 mutant and that this phenotype was diminished to near wild-type levels in the ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2 double mutant. Most notably, these high magnification views of the B. thetaiotaomicron capsule reveal the density and complexity of this bacterium's glycan-rich surface, an environment through which all assimilated nutrients, including the many other complex glycans that this species is capable of degrading, must pass to reach the cell surface.Finally, we analyzed the compositions of the capsules produced by the wild-type and ΩBT3992 and ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2 strains. Extracellular polysaccharides extracted from bacterial cells grown to mid-exponential phase in MM-glucose were acid-hydrolyzed and assayed to determine their sugar content (Fig. 5C). Thirteen different sugars were detected; nine eluted identically to known monosaccharide standards, but four did not correspond to any standards used but were clearly distinguishable from the monosaccharide standards (see supplemental Fig. S6 for representative HPAEC-PAD traces). Compared with wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron, the sugars present in the ΩBT3992 capsule differed substantially. Two unidentified sugars that behaved similarly to acidic monosaccharides became more prominent with increased expression of CPS2, and these two sugars were diminished in the ΩBT3992/ΔCPS2 double mutant. Thus, in cells grown in vitro using glucose as a sole carbon source, the increased transcription of CPS2 clearly translates into a cellular phenotype; production of a larger surface capsule that differs biochemically from that usually expressed by wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron.We attempted to culture B. thetaiotaomicron and another species with broad saccharolytic potential, Bacteroides ovatus, on a capsule extracted from the ΩBT3992 mutant. Neither species was able to use this extracted material as a sole carbon source. However, this lack of growth was not due to toxic inhibitors introduced during capsule extraction as the addition of glucose to minimal medium containing extracted CPS2 restored growth (data not shown). Based on these results, we concluded that the new cellular transcriptome expressed upon mutation of anti-σBT3992, which primarily involves increased expression of the O-glycan Sus-like system BT3983–88 (Fig. 6A), is associated with a regulated alteration of cell surface glycan chemistry. Possible physiologic reasons for the coordinated regulation of glycan metabolism with capsule structure are discussed below under “Prospectus.” To explore the basis of this coordination in more detail, we sought to characterize the regulatory pathway leading to increased CPS2 expression.Different regulatory pathways mediate CPS locus and PUL expression. A, a schematic of the BT3983–94 PUL. ORFs are color-coded according to the legend in Fig. 1, and predicted glycoside hydrolase (GH) activities are provided based on CAZy family designations. The white ORF in the middle of the locus is BT3989, a hypothetical gene that does not exhibit induction with the adjacent genes and may not be involved in PUL function. B, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of gene expression from three loci in wild-type (black bars) and ΩBT3992 (red bars) and ΩBT3992/ΔBT3983–88 (gray bars) strain backgrounds. Two genes, BT3983 and BT3984, encoding outer membrane protein components of the BT3983–94 Sus-like system, exhibit strong induction when anti-σBT3992 is disrupted. Note that these two transcripts are absent and, therefore, are not detectable in the ΩBT3992/ΔBT3983–88 double mutant. Similarly, two genes (BT0463 and BT0482) positioned near the beginning and end of CPS2, show induction in the ΩBT3992 strain. However, this induction is reduced to wild-type levels in the ΩBT3992/ΔBT3983–88 double mutant, indicating that expression of the BT3983–88 Sus-like components is required for CPS activation. A probe gene (BT0206) from one PUL (BT0206–14) that is unlinked to BT3992 is also dependent on expression of the BT3983–88 for its activation. Conversely, induction of a transcript (BT4404) from another unlinked PUL (BT4403–07) in both mutant strains indicates that the induction of unlinked genes is not always dependent on the presence of outer membrane components. Similarly, regulation of BT3992 is unaffected by loss of the Sus-like proteins. C, expression of genes in the ECF-σBT3993 regulon in isogenic wild-type (black bars) and ΩBT3992 (red bars) and ΩBT3992/ΔBT3993 (green bars) strains. Loss of ECF-σBT3993 eliminates activation of all genes in the regulon. Most notably, expression of BT4404, a component of the ECF-σ-linked BT4403–07 PUL, is reduced to wild-type levels. Thus, the cross-talk between these loci must occur at the level of ECF-σBT3993 activation of the BT4404 promoter and not at other, non-cognate signaling nodes, such as anti-σBT3992 activation of ECF-σBT4403, which would still be intact in the ΩBT3992/ΔBT3993 strain. D, a model summarizing the results of data presented in panels B and C. Note that the unknown signaling pathway that controls CPS2 and BT0206–14 expression is also dependent on the trans-envelope signaling pathway, which is required for expression of the BT3983–88 Sus-like system. IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane.Two of five de-repressed ECF-σ regulons (disruptions of anti-σ genes BT1052 and BT3992) resulted in the strongest inductions of CPS loci (13- and 81-fold average induction of CPS8 and CPS2, respectively; Fig. 4 and supplemental Table S4). In contrast to the remaining two anti-σ disruptions (BT1618 and BT4356), which resulted in 4.1- and 6.5-fold changes, respectively, neither of these two mutants that caused the larger changes in CPS expression was associated with polar effects on their downstream sus-like genes. This observation led us to hypothesize that the transcriptional activation pathway(s) leading to CPS expression is dependent on the presence of components of the Sus-like outer membrane systems. Therefore, we reconstructed the anti-σ BT3992 gene insertion (ΩBT3992) that caused de-repression of CPS2 in a strain that also had a deletion of the entire BT3983–88 operon, which encodes the primary mucin O-glycan-responsive outer membrane system regulated by this trans-envelope signaling switch (see Fig. 6A for a schematic of this PUL). This double mutant (ΩBT3992/ΔBT3983–88) was grown to mid-log phase in MM-glucose medium, alongside the isogenic wild-type strain and the original ΩBT3992 single mutant, to determine whether loss of BT3983–88 influences CPS2 expression (Fig. 6B). Remarkably, quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of transcript abundance revealed that the ΩBT3992/ΔBT3983–88 double mutant was unable to activate expression of probe genes (BT0463, BT0482, and BT0206) belonging to the CPS2 locus and the unlinked BT0206–14 PUL. In contrast, control assays indicated successful depression of the ECF-σBT3993 regulon in this double mutant; de-repression was confirmed by probing autoregulation of BT3992 as well as a gene (BT4404) from the unlinked BT4403–07 PUL, neither of which exhibited dependence on BT3983–88 for their expression.Thus, a different signaling pathway, which requires expression of a Sus-like outer membrane system, controls CPS2 and BT0206–14 expression (Fig. 6D). The components of this pathway that ultimately influence these loci are unknown. However, we can eliminate the possibility that the mechanism responsible for activating these loci is simply the result of ECF-σBT3993 recognition of the CPS2 and BT0206–14 promoters; more likely, it involves another pathway that begins with expression of one or more proteins in the BT3983–88 system and ends with activation of the CPS2 promoter.Finally, we probed expression of the CPS2 locus and the two different unlinked PULs that exhibited activation in the ΩBT3992 strain in an additional ΩBT3992/ΔBT3993 double mutant that also lacks ECF-σBT3993. Although this mutant expresses the same de-repressed truncated version of anti-σBT3992 as the single mutant described above, the absence of ECF-σBT3993 renders it incapable of activating gene expression through its cognate ECF-σ factor but could allow it to signal via non-cognate anti-σ/ECF-σ interactions. Like CPS2 and the BT0206–14 PUL, we found that the BT4403–07 PUL also requires ECF-σBT3993 for activation (Fig. 6C).Therefore, the two unlinked PULs that show activation by ECF-σBT3993 each appear to be controlled by different routes; one system (BT0206–14) is regulated by a similar mechanism as CPS2 and is dependent on expression of Sus-like proteins, whereas the other system is likely induced by ECF-σBT3993 activation of a related promoter residing upstream of BT4403–07 (see Fig. 6D for a model). This latter case provides a likely example of ECF-σ/promoter cross-talk between two similar PULs and may reflect their recent duplication and diversification from a single ancestral locus (13). Future experiments will be required to explore each of these regulatory pathways in more detail, especially the unanticipated connection between expression of the BT3983–88 Sus-like system and the CPS2 and BT0206–14 loci.Metabolism of complex carbohydrates is a fundamental force shaping the evolution of the human distal gut microbiota. In this competitive ecosystem, the needs of gut symbionts to efficiently harvest complex glycans as nutrients must be balanced with their simultaneous need to shield themselves from harmful environmental factors, including the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system, phage attacks, and antimicrobial peptides produced by the host and/or members of a microbial community. A common mechanism employed by many bacteria to protect against some of these environmental assaults is to produce polysaccharide capsules, which are often varied within subpopulations of the same species (e.g. by phase variation) to pre-adapt some lineages to future challenges (6). Although phase variation of microbial surface structures is frequently accomplished through random alterations in gene expression, such as promoter inversion, we show here that a broadly saccharolytic human gut symbiont, B. thetaiotaomicron, also modulates its surface by directly coordinating CPS production with its expression of Sus-like outer membrane proteins deployed during glycan acquisition. In turn, expression of Sus-like systems is primarily controlled by a variety of positive-acting transcription factors (e.g. ECF-σ factors and hybrid two-component systems, plus others), whose influence may be modulated by additional forms of regulation, such as catabolite repression and recombinational gene shuffling.4 Thus, B. thetaiotaomicron uses a complex signaling network to link the nutrient milieu of its gut environment with its extracellular capsule.The immediate physiologic benefit obtained from coupling CPS synthesis to glycan catabolism remains obscure. However, the observation that B. thetaiotaomicron endures the metabolic cost of building a novel capsule structure encoded by CPS2 de novo, which differs chemically from the O-glycans targeted by the BT3983–88 Sus-like system and cannot be subsequently re-assimilated as a nutrient, supports the notion that this regulated cellular event plays some role in facilitating glycan acquisition. From this perspective, the high magnification scanning electron microscopy views of the B. thetaiotaomicron capsule are insightful; all cellular glycan catabolism by outer membrane-localized Sus-like systems must occur after substrates have transited the “forest” of the surface capsule, which can be several hundred nanometers thick. It is possible that one role of coordinated CPS and Sus-like system expression is to optimize the miscibility of target glycans and other nutrients within this capsule layer. A second possibility, which is not incompatible with the previous explanation, is that some capsule structures interfere with the glycan binding sites of certain Sus-like systems. Coordinated expression of a non-interfering capsule (e.g. CPS2 when BT3983–88 is expressed), which differs in its chemistry from the environmental glycans being targeted as nutrients, could alleviate this interference. Finally, work in the related gut symbiont B. fragilis has shown that at least one metabolic salvage pathway (l-fucose assimilation) serves as a non-de novo source of monosaccharides for CPS synthesis (33). B. fragilis adds l-fucose to several of its surface capsules but only does so when this sugar is salvageable from the growth environment. Although we show that expression of the CPS2 gene cluster by B. thetaiotaomicron directs synthesis of a capsule containing at least two prominent sugars when only glucose is present in the medium, it is possible that expression of this system in the context of actual O-glycan degradation, and the consequent availability of sugars other than glucose in the growth milieu, could result in additional linkages being added to the CPS2 polymer.Taken together, the findings reported here reveal a link between some of the complex glycans encountered in the mammalian gut (mucin O-glycans) and the surface glycan structures of B. thetaiotaomicron, a representative of one of the two prominent bacterial phyla commonly inhabiting this human body habitat (2). In light of previous experiments, which observed shifts in CPS expression upon alteration of the types of dietary glycans being consumed by gnotobiotic mice colonized with B. thetaiotaomicron (15, 21), similar mechanisms may mediate coordination of glycan degradation and CPS synthesis in response to the presence of dietary and/or microbial carbohydrates. Additional studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that expression of at least one B. thetaiotaomicron CPS locus, CPS4, confers a fitness advantage in vivo in the distal gut of gnotobiotic mice (5). However, in gnotobiotic mice with an engineered and sustained CPS4-specific secretory IgA response, continued CPS4 expression becomes a disadvantage to the bacterium. Thus, a series of dynamic regulatory links likely couple the complex glycan milieu of the gut and the responses of the host immune system to the expressed surface carbohydrate repertoire of this and other gut Bacteroides in order to support sustained colonization. Future experiments will be required to further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying these regulatory pathways. The results should provide important insights into the complex and dynamic relationship between our diets, the structures and functions of our gut microbial communities, and our host physiology.The University of California at San Diego Glycotechnology Core Resource skillfully performed all glycan analyses.

PMC2714936,A Cell Wall–Degrading Esterase of Xanthomonas oryzae Requires a Unique Substrate Recognition Module for Pathogenesis on Rice[W],False,"Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo) causes bacterial blight, a serious disease of rice (Oryza sativa). LipA is a secretory virulence factor of Xoo, implicated in degradation of rice cell walls and the concomitant elicitation of innate immune responses, such as callose deposition and programmed cell death. Here, we present the high-resolution structural characterization of LipA that reveals an all-helical ligand binding module as a distinct functional attachment to the canonical hydrolase catalytic domain. We demonstrate that the enzyme binds to a glycoside ligand through a rigid pocket comprising distinct carbohydrate-specific and acyl chain recognition sites where the catalytic triad is situated 15 Å from the anchored carbohydrate. Point mutations disrupting the carbohydrate anchor site or blocking the pocket, even at a considerable distance from the enzyme active site, can abrogate in planta LipA function, exemplified by loss of both virulence and the ability to elicit host defense responses. A high conservation of the module across genus Xanthomonas emphasizes the significance of this unique plant cell wall–degrading function for this important group of plant pathogenic bacteria. A comparison with the related structural families illustrates how a typical lipase is recruited to act on plant cell walls to promote virulence, thus providing a remarkable example of the emergence of novel functions around existing scaffolds for increased proficiency of pathogenesis during pathogen-plant coevolution.The coevolution of plants and their pathogens has given rise to elaborate attack-counterattack strategies. The first barrier faced by plant pathogens is the rigid and chemically complex host cell wall. The ability to secrete specific hydrolytic enzymes to sever different components of the plant cell wall is a major virulence attribute of phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria (Albersheim et al., 1969). While cellulases, xylanases, polygalacturonases, and pectate lyases degrade the main polysaccharide constituents of the plant cell walls, enzymes like pectin esterases cleave the ester cross-links between the polysaccharide fibrils and loosen the cell walls (Esquerre-Tugaye et al., 2000).Cell wall damage not only provides a point of entry to the pathogen but also acts as a mark of invasion that the plant can sense. Degradation products that are released by the action of cell wall–degrading enzymes on plant cell walls can induce potent innate immune responses of plants (Darvill and Albersheim, 1984; Ryan and Farmer, 1991). These defense responses include the synthesis of antimicrobial compounds, such as phytoalexins, and the strengthening of plant cell walls through deposition of callose, as well as programmed cell death reactions. Thus, it appears that the cell wall–degrading enzymes serve dual functions. They are required for virulence, but their activity also induces host defense responses. Successful microbial plant pathogens are able to overcome this difficulty because they have the capability to suppress these innate immune responses (Jha et al., 2005).The genus Xanthomonas includes bacteria that cause more than 300 different diseases on a wide variety of economically important crops, such as rice (Oryza sativa), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), pepper (Capsicum annuum), cabbage (Brassica oleracea), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), and lemon (Citrus limon). One member of this genus, Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo) causes bacterial blight, a serious disease of rice. This bacterium employs a battery of enzymes that includes a lipase/esterase (LipA), cellulase (ClsA), xylanase (XynB), and cellobiosidase (CbsA) to degrade rice cell walls (Rajeshwari et al., 2005; Jha et al., 2007). These enzymes are secreted by a specialized apparatus called the type II secretion (T2S) system (Ray et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2005). The T2S system and the enzymes secreted through it are important for the virulence and pathogenesis of Xoo. Mutations in the T2S system cause a complete loss of virulence on rice, while mutations in the genes for individual T2S secreted proteins, such as LipA and ClsA, cause partial loss of virulence (Ray et al., 2000; Rajeshwari et al., 2005; Jha et al., 2007). A double mutant in the lipA and clsA genes results in a more severe loss of virulence, suggesting a redundancy in the functioning of these proteins. In addition to the above, mutations in the gene for an in planta expressed cellulase (EglXoB) affect Xoo virulence (Hu et al., 2007). Treatment of rice leaves and roots with LipA, ClsA, and CbsA proteins induces rice defense responses, such as callose deposition and programmed cell death. The actual elicitors of the defense responses appear to be soluble cell wall degradation products that are released following the action of these enzymes on rice cell walls (Jha et al., 2007). This is in sharp contrast with the previously described fungal xylanases, which have been shown to function as direct elicitors of defense responses through recognition of a particular sequence motif in the xylanase by a specific plant receptor (Ron and Avni, 2004).LipA is a 42-kD protein with tributyrin and Tween 20–degrading activity, a general indicator of lipase/esterase function (Rajeshwari et al., 2005). LipA homologs are present in several gram-negative bacteria, including all xanthomonads whose genomes have been sequenced. The LipA homologs are poorly characterized and categorized as conserved hypothetical proteins or putative secretory lipases, indicating that these proteins have a lipase/esterase activity different from the feruloyl esterases, pectin esterases, and cutinases that are involved in plant cell wall degradation (Vorwerk et al., 2004; Bauer et al., 2006).In an effort to understand the basis of LipA function, we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of LipA. Analysis of LipA interactions with β-octyl glucoside, a small molecule captured during ligand screening, led to the structure-based identification of a distinct ligand binding module in LipA. We created several point mutations in this module and confirmed its role in ligand binding, virulence, and elicitation of host defense responses using a battery of in vitro and in planta assays, demonstrating the essentiality of this unique module in Xoo pathogenesis.LipA is an α/β hydrolase fold protein with a nine-stranded central mixed β-sheet surrounded by α-helices in a typical α/β hydrolase topology (Nardini and Dijkstra, 1999) and an additional N-terminal short strand and helix. The canonical catalytic triad residues Ser-176, His-377, and Asp-336 (Figure 1A) are positioned similar to several other hydrolases. The nucleophilic S176 lies on a strand-turn-helix elbow, forming a G-X-S-X-G motif that is conserved in hydrolases (Jaeger et al., 1999). The distinctive feature of the LipA structure is the presence of a 108–amino acid domain present as an insertion between the β6 and β7 strands, corresponding topologically to the lid insertion position of triacylglycerol lipases (Figure 1B). This insertion domain consists of seven α-helices with one 310 helix.Three-Dimensional Structure of LipA.(A) Stereoview of the ligand-bound structure of LipA showing two bound molecules of β-octyl glucoside and the catalytic triad. The hydrolase domain is depicted in pink and the ligand binding domain in green. The ligand molecules (yellow) Ser-176, Asp-336, and His-377 are given in a stick representation.(B) Topology diagram of LipA. The β-sheets are shown as arrows, α-helices as cylinders, and 310 helices as rectangles. The αD set of helices form the ligand binding domain (green).(C) Residues lining the BOG-bound tunnel are shown. Electron density of the two BOG molecules is a 2Fobs-Fcalc map contoured at 1σ value. The amino acids are shown as yellow sticks. Active-site Ser-176 is highlighted. The residues from the LipA structure without BOG are superimposed and shown in gray.LipA exhibits low sequence identity (≤20%) with characterized hydrolase fold proteins. It shows 17% sequence identity, DALI Z-score of 31.5, and a root mean square deviation of 2.7 Å over 326 Cα atoms with Candida antarctica lipase CalA, indicating a high structural similarity despite low sequence similarity (Holm and Sander, 1998; Ericsson et al., 2008). CalA also has a lid domain equivalent in size to the LipA lid-like domain. A DALI search with the LipA lid-like domain neither identifies the CalA lid nor any other protein of known structure as a structural homolog. However, a manual structural superposition of the two proteins indicates a considerable fold similarity also in the lid region (Figure 2B). The sequence identity between the two domains, when considered without the hydrolase domains, is only ∼9% with a root mean square deviation of 3.2 Å over 92 aligned Cα atoms. Other structural hits for the entire LipA are mostly acyl-amino acid peptidases (Protein Data Bank [PDB] code: 1VE6) and dipeptidyl peptidases, (PDB code: 2D5L), which do not possess a similar lid-like domain, and the structural similarity is limited to the hydrolase domain only (see Supplemental Table 1 online) (Bartlam et al., 2004; Ito et al., 2006). An interesting feature in the structure is the presence of at least two Ser-His conserved clusters on the face opposite to the region that contains the canonical catalytic triad. These may be nonfunctional clusters, but their position and partial similarity to general hydrolase active sites is certainly worth noting (see Supplemental Figure 1 online).The LipA Ligand Binding Tunnel Has a Carbohydrate-Anchoring Pocket.(A) Cartoon representation of the ligand binding tunnel. The two black filled circles indicate the stretch of residues 28 to 36 for which the electron density is missing.(B) Superimposition of the lid domains of LipA (yellow) and CalA (blue). BOG and PEG are shown as yellow and blue sticks, respectively. Active-site Ser residues for LipA and CalA are shown in yellow and blue, respectively.(C) Important BOG1-specific interactions in the carbohydrate-anchoring pocket of LipA are main-chain mediated and shown as dashed lines with distance in Å.(D) Multiple sequence alignment of LipA ligand binding domain with homologous regions in other bacteria. Residues marked in green are amino acids lining the tunnel, and the red dots indicate the residues in the carbohydrate-anchoring pocket that were mutagenized. The black dots represent 39– to 45–amino acid inserts in the sequences of the corresponding proteins that are not shown in the figure. The black cylinders indicate α-helices.We screened for putative ligands of LipA using detergents and fatty acid additives that could mimic its in planta substrate(s) using cocrystallization. LipA cocrystallized with the glycoside detergent β-octyl glucoside (BOG) in the same crystallization condition as that of the wild type. The cocrystal structure showed two molecules of bound BOG (Figure 1A). One molecule (referred to as BOG1) has B-factors, indicative of relative mobilities of the atoms, in the range of 18 to 23 Å2, while the other molecule (BOG2) is loosely bound, indicated by higher B-factors (45 to 50 Å2). An electron density map contoured around the ligands is shown in Figure 1C. The ligand acyl chains, placed very close to each other (6.9 Å), reveal a 30-Å tunnel in the LipA structure that passes adjacent to the active-site residues and ends very close to the outer surface of the protein (Figure 2A). The BOG2 glucose moiety hangs out of the tunnel facing the solvent. The proximity of the BOG1 terminal methyl group with the Ser-176 active site residue (3.8 Å) strengthens the idea that this tunnel in LipA could be involved in substrate binding. The putative entry side opening is very broad (20 Å), and a narrow exit point between Ile-287, Val-290, and Ser-220 is also evident. Root mean square deviation upon Cα superimposition of the wild-type and ligand-bound LipA structures is only 0.29 Å, indicating almost no structural changes upon ligand binding (Figure 1C). The side chains also superimpose well between the two structures, indicating a relatively rigid pocket employed for binding BOG. The lid-like domain may also not exhibit any domain motion with respect to the hydrolase-fold upon ligand binding, unlike large movements seen in conventional lid domains of lipases during interfacial activation (Nardini and Dijkstra, 1999). An interesting feature common to both wild-type and BOG-bound structures is the absence of electron density for the region from residues 28 to 36 (Figure 2A, black dots) in the vicinity of the BOG2 site, indicating that these residues are very flexible or unstructured, possibly due to the absence of the natural substrate. This sequence is conspicuously absent in other closely related Xanthomonas strains (see Supplemental Figure 2 online). Considering the position of the missing fragment, which marks the base of the entrance to the tunnel, this region might be involved in holding a long-chain substrate and positioning its entry into the tunnel.The glucoside moiety of BOG1 interacts with the main chain atoms of LipA at the extreme end of the tunnel, ∼15 Å away from the active-site Ser, in a pocket made of three Gly residues and a few other polar residues (Figure 2C). To ascertain whether the pocket would confer carbohydrate specificity, we looked at the possibility of several other sugars besides β-d-glucose occupying the pocket and found that except β-d-xylose, all other sugars that were examined face clashes from the residues surrounding the pocket (see Supplemental Table 2 online). BOG1 β-d-glucose O2 is held, albeit loosely, by main-chain oxygens of Asn-228 and Ser-218, O4 is held by O: Trp-219, and O6 by O: Gly-231 (Figure 2D). Important intramolecular interactions keep Gly-231 and Trp-219 in position even in the LipA structure without BOG, indicating that the pocket is held in place and that a case of substrate-induced fit may not be applicable. Structural coordinates of various sugar conformers with the same pucker as β-d-glucopyranose were superimposed in silico with the glucosyl moiety of the BOG bound in LipA (see Supplemental Table 2 online). Epimers of β-d-glucose (i.e., β-d-mannose and galactose) have axially located O2 and O4, respectively, and face a severe hydrophobic clash when superimposed on the BOG1 sugar ring with the same pucker. Similarly, steric hindrances toward the axial O1 exclude the possibility of binding to α-d- sugars.Isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) experiments confirmed these structural predictions. The calorimetric binding of LipA versus BOG fits into a one-site model (Figure 3A), while that of LipA versus β-octyl galactoside could be fitted into a sequential two-site model, indicating that the two modes of binding are different. Since the overall binding affinities can be used as indicators of the strength of binding, we compared LipA versus BOG Kd (76.7 μM) to LipA versus β-octyl galactoside Kd (739.5 μM). The 10-fold reduction in the binding affinity of β-octyl galactoside compared with BOG is in accordance with our proposition that the tunnel has a sugar-anchoring pocket with a predetermined, though moderate, affinity for β-d-glucose.LipA Exhibits BOG Binding and Esterase Activity.(A) Binding isotherm of LipA titrated against BOG using ITC. Top panel, raw titration curve; bottom panel, heats fitted by nonlinear regressional curve fitting using one site binding model.(B) Presence of a zone of clearance indicates LipA activity on short-chain triacylglycerides (1) C4 (tributyrin) and (2) C6 (tricaproin), while no activity is seen on (3) C8 (tricaprylin). Holes punched on the right side contain LipA, and the ones on the left side contain buffer.(C) Loss of esterase activity in the S176A active-site mutant protein. Tributyrin clearance activity of (1) buffer; (2) LipA (wild-type) protein; and mutant LipA proteins (3) S176A, (4) N228W, (5) G231A, (6) G231I, (7) G231F, and (8) G221I. Plates were photographed after 2 h of incubation at room temperature.Conspicuously, the rest of the tunnel is lined with several hydrophobic residues that trace the tunnel from the entrance to the sugar-anchoring pocket. Presence of this hydrophobic pocket suggests that the moderate specificity conferred by the few hydrogen bonds on the sugar moiety of the ligand is sustained by extensive hydrophobic interaction of the acyl chain with the rest of the residues lining the LipA tunnel. Glycoside ligand binding by LipA using recognition pockets for both carbohydrate and acyl chain components provides a rationale for the lack of detection of free sugar binding in ITC assays and in ligand screening experiments. The BOG-bound LipA structure may not be directly relevant in the in planta context since BOG is a nonhydrolyzable compound that has not been identified as a component of plant cell walls. However, the BOG complex provides valuable insights into the possible mode of natural ligand binding and the selectivity role of LipA.A search for LipA sequence homologs using BLAST in the nonredundant database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) identifies a wide range of proteo- and actinobacteria with one or more LipA-like proteins in their genomes (with an E-value of 10−7 and lower). A structure-based sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree was generated using these sequences (see Supplemental Data Set 1 and Supplemental Figure 3 online) using CalA as an outgroup. LipA sequences of Xanthomonas strains and Xylella fastidiosa, the closely related plant pathogen, cluster together with a high bootstrap value. A small subset of these LipA homologs, consisting solely of the genus Xanthomonas and the organisms demarcated as the blue group in Supplemental Figure 3 online, contains a LipA-like ligand binding domain. Interestingly, despite a high conservation of residues surrounding the tunnel region identified in the LipA-like proteins in this subset, it appears that the carbohydrate recognition is present only in genus Xanthomonas. This proposition is based on our structural analysis indicating Gly-231 as the crucial residue for the sugar ring positioning. Any substitution at this position would protrude into the pocket and abolish sugar anchoring. Gly-231 is invariant in all Xanthomonas LipA proteins with one exception (Figure 2D). Xanthomonas campestris pv campestris (strain ATCC 33913) XCC2374 has Thr in place of Gly-231 of LipA, although the strain has an additional LipA-like protein XCC2957 that retains Gly-231. A LipA-like protein in the soil bacterium Ideonella, with 27% identity to LipA, has been functionally characterized recently (Shinohara et al., 2007). Interestingly, it has been shown to degrade β-hydroxy palmitic (C16) acid methyl ester. We generated a homology model of this protein based on the LipA structure (see Supplemental Figure 4 online). The model indicates the presence of a longer hydrophobic tunnel lacking a carbohydrate binding site in the LipA-like protein from Ideonella and is in agreement with its substrate specificity.Structural superposition of LipA with CalA illustrates that the polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule bound in CalA structure occupies a very different ligand binding pocket (Figure 2B). The analogous region in Xoo LipA is packed with hydrophobic amino acids, and the PEG molecule will have substantial clashes with them. In addition, the CalA region that superimposes on the LipA carbohydrate-anchoring pocket is predominantly occupied by the main chain of a loop, indicating that there is no room for such a pocket in CalA. Therefore, it is clear that the pocket in LipA is unique in nature with a carbohydrate-anchoring site located far away from the solely acyl binding pocket of CalA. This finding, along with the phylogenetic study, advocates for LipA-like proteins to be grouped as a distinct class of cell wall–degrading esterases.Movement of a small flap-like lid in lipases is implicated in the phenomenon of interfacial activation in response to highly hydrophobic triacylglycerides (Verger, 1997). Esterases act on less hydrophobic substrates and generally lack lid domains (Jaeger et al., 1999). When present, the lid remains permanently open, such as in fungal feruloyl esterases (Hermoso et al., 2004). The lid is absent in certain lipases, cutinases, acetylxylan esterases, and cholesterol esterases (Martinez et al., 1992; Chen et al., 1998; Ghosh et al., 1999; van Pouderoyen et al., 2001). The presence of an unusually large seven-helical domain in place of the usual lid and the absence of any evident movement upon ligand binding in LipA prompted us to check whether LipA has lipase or esterase activity. We found that LipA can degrade smaller chain length triacylglycerides like C4 (tributyrin) and C6 (tricaproin) but lacks activity on C8 (tricaprylin) or longer triacylglycerides (Figure 3B). It is negative for triolein hydrolyzing activity assessed by the olive oil-rhodamine B assay, for which all true lipases are positive. LipA shows maximum enzymatic activity on p-nitrophenyl (pNP) butyrate (C4) compared with pNP-acetate (C2), pNP-hexanoate (C6), and higher chain length pNP esters (see Supplemental Figure 5A online). The specific activity plot of LipA with pNP-butyrate (see Supplemental Figure 5B online) also indicates the esterase activity as the uniform sigmoidal plot is indicative of an absence of interfacial activation (Martinelle et al., 1995). Moreover, this experiment suggests that the natural ligand of LipA is likely to contain aliphatic chains as is also indicated by the presence of several hydrophobic residues in the tunnel leading to the carbohydrate-anchoring site from the catalytic Ser-176.To validate our structural prediction that the tunnel present in LipA structure is involved in substrate recognition, we generated several point mutations in LipA. Gly-231 was identified as a crucial residue mediating main chain interaction of LipA with BOG. The close proximity of this amino acid with the sugar ring of BOG suggests that the smallest replacement at this position would have a severe effect on LipA action; therefore, Gly-231 was mutated to Ala, Ile, and Phe. The residue Asn-228 was mutated to Trp to block the tunnel just below the carbohydrate-anchoring pocket, which would protrude into the acyl-chain binding region. Gly-221, another invariant Gly located in the sugar-anchoring pocket (Figure 2D), was mutated to an Ile. However, Gly-221 has no direct interaction with the sugar ring of BOG (Figure 2C). When tested for tributyrin degrading activity, all these mutants show zone of clearance (Figure 3C). It clearly indicates that a small substrate, such as tributyrin, would not require occupying the tunnel up to the sugar pocket that is located ∼15 Å away from the active-site Ser-176. We also checked for enzyme activity in a S176A mutant of LipA protein, and absence of a zone of clearance on tributyrin plates indicates that the LipA active-site indeed employs the nucleophilic Ser-176.The in vitro binding of BOG to LipA or its mutant proteins was assessed using ITC. LipA, upon titration with BOG, shows a moderate binding affinity with a Kd value of 76.7 μM (Figure 3A). S176A mutant LipA protein has Kd values of BOG binding similar to that of wild-type LipA, indicating that the tunnel for BOG binding is intact despite a loss in enzymatic activity. All three Gly-231 mutant proteins of LipA display reduced binding of BOG with G231F mutant protein of LipA showing an almost 25-fold reduction from wild-type enzyme (Table 1). Therefore, the presence of the tunnel is crucial for BOG binding, which is not affected in the context of the inactive S176A mutant. N228W and G221I mutant proteins of LipA bind to BOG with affinities similar (less than twofold reduction) to that of wild-type LipA, suggesting that these changes in the sugar binding pocket do not have a significant effect on BOG binding.Binding Parameters and Thermodynamics of BOG Titration with Wild-Type LipA and Mutants Calculated Using ITCThe Xoo LipA-deficient strain BXO2001 shows reduced virulence on rice compared with BXO43, the wild-type strain (Rajeshwari et al., 2005). We transferred expression constructs for wild-type LipA and various point mutants into BXO2001. Expression of LipA protein in the culture supernatants of these Xoo strains was confirmed using polyclonal rabbit anti-LipA antibodies (see Supplemental Figure 6 online). Upon inoculation on rice, the strain expressing the S176A mutant protein of LipA exhibits reduced virulence (at a level that is comparable to the BXO2001 strain), confirming that the enzymatic activity of LipA is essential for optimal levels of virulence on rice. Remarkably, the Xoo strains expressing G231A, G231I, G231F, and N228W mutant proteins of LipA exhibit a virulence deficiency similar to that observed in the case of BXO2001. However, the strain expressing the G221I mutant protein of LipA exhibits wild-type levels of virulence (Figure 4). A reduction in virulence caused by either blocking the acyl chain binding region beneath the sugar anchor site (N228W) or obstructing the sugar-anchoring pocket (Gly-231 mutants) specifically proves that the tunnel is indeed involved in natural substrate binding. Virulence proficiency of the G221I mutation indicates that this does not affect binding of the natural substrate in the host as indicated by in vitro binding studies also.Virulence Phenotypes of LipA Mutants.(A) Xoo strains were inoculated on rice leaves, and lesion lengths were measured after 7 d. At least 10 leaves were used per strain. Similar results were obtained in another independent experiment. Error bars represent sd. Values marked with an asterisk are significantly different from the values obtained for BXO43 at P < 0.05 in a Student's two-tailed t test for independent means. BXO43 (wild-type Xoo), BXO2001 (LipA− mutant), and various strains that express either wild-type LipA or mutant LipA proteins from the pHM1 plasmid in the BXO2001 background are shown.(B) Photographs of lesions caused by (1) BXO43, (2) BXO2001, and (3) pG231F. The latter two strains exhibit reduced disease symptoms (brown lesions) compared with BXO43.LipA treatment elicits rice innate immune responses that are considered as a reaction to LipA-mediated degradation of rice cell walls (Jha et al., 2007). A marker of plant defense responses, in general, is the cell wall fortification by rapid deposition of a β-1,3-glucan polymer called callose around the site of pathogen entry (Bestwick et al., 1995). LipA is known to induce callose deposition at the site of infiltration in rice leaves, and we investigated the ability of various LipA mutants to induce callose deposition. Wild-type and mutant LipA proteins were purified and infiltrated into rice leaves. Callose deposits appear as fluorescent spots upon staining with aniline blue and observation under UV light. Infiltration with the mutant LipA proteins S176A, G231A, G231I, G231F, and N228W results in background levels of callose deposition, similar to that observed in buffer-treated leaves, while leaves infiltrated with the LipA-G221I mutant exhibit levels of callose deposition that are no different from those observed in leaves infiltrated with the strain expressing wild-type LipA (Figure 5).LipA Mutant Proteins Are Deficient at Induction of Defense Response–Associated Callose Deposition in Rice Leaves.(A) to (D) Light microscope images (×10 resolution; bars = 100 μm) of rice leaves infiltrated with buffer (A), wild-type LipA (B), S176A LipA (C), and G231F LipA (D). Purified proteins were infiltrated into rice leaves and stained for callose deposition. The callose deposits appear as sharp bright fluorescent spots as against the dull white spots representing the trichomes.(E) Number of callose deposits in leaf zones infiltrated with buffer, wild-type LipA, or various mutant proteins. Mean and sd were calculated for number of callose deposits from a leaf area of 0.60 mm2. Data were collected from four leaves in each experiment (three experiments indicated as ExpI, ExpII, and ExpIII) and four different viewing areas from the infiltrated region of each leaf. Asterisks indicate that the values obtained after treatment with G221I are significantly different at P < 0.05 compared with wild-type LipA values from the same experiment.Localized programmed cell death (PCD) is another important host defense response to pathogen attack (Pennell and Lamb, 1997). Rice roots were treated with the purified wild-type and mutant LipA proteins, stained with propidium iodide (PI) and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. PI is excluded from live cells, and its internalization is indicative of cell death. Rice roots treated with wild-type LipA take up PI, and the PI staining material is dispersed within the cell. This is indicative of DNA fragmentation caused by PCD. S176A mutant protein-treated roots showed absence of PCD. Similarly, the Gly-231 mutants and the N228W mutant protein treatments resembled buffer-treated roots with no evidence of LipA-induced PCD (Figure 6). Treatment of rice roots with the three purified Gly-231 mutant proteins (Gly-231 mutated to Ala, Ile, or Phe) show similar in planta phenotypes, proving that substrate binding in the natural context would be perturbed by any bigger residue substitution that might protrude into the sugar binding pocket. The N228W mutation affects LipA function in planta, indicating that it disrupts binding to the natural substrate. However, this mutation does not affect BOG binding, possibly because BOG might be smaller than the natural substrate. The Gly-221 mutant protein is able to induce PCD. The lack of any in planta phenotypes associated with the G221I mutation suggests that this change can be tolerated, possibly because of the presence of this residue on a less-packed region.LipA Mutant Proteins Are Deficient at Induction of Defense Response–Associated PCD in Rice Roots.Rice roots were treated with purified proteins (either wild type or mutant LipA), stained with PI, and examined under a confocal microscope to assess the extent of DNA fragmentation. The control buffer-treated roots (A) exhibit a prominent cell wall–associated autofluorescence but no internalization of PI into the cells. Treatment with either wild-type (B) or G221I (H) LipA resulted in cell death (intake of PI) accompanied by dispersed intracellular staining, which is indicative of nuclear fragmentation. No cell death is seen in roots treated with S176A (C), N228W (D), G231A (E), G231I (F), or G231F mutant proteins (G). Bars = 20 μm.Two mutant proteins of LipA (G231F and N228W) were cocrystallized with BOG at the same concentration as used for obtaining wild-type LipA-BOG cocrystals. The 2Fobs-Fcalc map contoured at 1σ before the inclusion of the mutated residue in the refinement clearly shows the protrusion of the bulkier residue in the binding pocket. G231F and N228W mutant protein structures could be superimposed with wild-type LipA with a root mean square deviation of 0.10 and 0.38 Å, respectively for 387 Cα atoms. Both structures showed an absence of BOG density in the lid-like domain, clearly due to the obstruction of the carbohydrate pocket caused by G231F (Figure 7A) or a blocking of the tunnel region by Trp due to N228W mutation (Figure 7B). Together, the mutant structures confirm that the phenotypes associated with these mutants are a direct consequence of blocking the pocket and not due to any major structural changes in the protein.The LipA Ligand Binding Tunnel Is Blocked in the G231F and N228W Mutant Proteins of LipA.The mutant structures have been superimposed with the wild-type LipA structure in both figures. Both mutant and wild-type structures are shown as green cartoons and superimpose completely except at the site of mutations. Electron density is shown only around the mutant residues that occlude the region occupied by BOG1 (shown as white stick) in the wild-type structure.(A) An unbiased 2Fobs-Fcalc map contoured at 1σ demonstrates disruption of the glucosyl ring binding site in the G231F mutant.(B) N228W obstructs the tunnel as shown in the unbiased 2Fobs-Fcalc map contoured at 1σ electron density around the mutant residue. The mutant structures have been superimposed with the wild-type LipA structure in both figures.The plant environment imposes a strong selective pressure on bacterial pathogens for the evolution of a repertoire of divergent and specialized proteins that promote colonization and survival within their hosts. Gain of new functions in proteins is frequently accomplished by modulation of preexisting functionally versatile folds (Thornton et al., 1999; Goldstein, 2008). The α/β hydrolase fold is one of the most promiscuous folds, found in numerous hydrolytic enzymes of diverse substrate specificity and exhibiting extensive sequence variability across several genomes (Ollis et al., 1992; Orengo et al., 1997; Hegyi and Gerstein, 1999; Holmquist, 2000). Esterases and lipases constitute a large group of hydrolase fold proteins. Several insertions and deletions in the basic hydrolase scaffold are found in nature, each change evolving toward hydrolyzing esters found in the local habitats of the pertinent organisms, thereby altering the substrate specificity (Nardini and Dijkstra, 1999). The lid domain of true lipases is a specific adaptation for long-chain triacylglycerols. Association of the catalytic hydrolase domain with additional nonlid noncatalytic domains for specialized substrate binding has been seen in prolyl oligopeptidases and brefeldin A esterase (Wei et al., 1999; Szeltner and Polgar, 2008). Our Xoo LipA crystal structure reveals a hitherto unidentified mode of substrate binding in a canonical α/β hydrolase, fine-tuning esterase activity for a plant-associated function. Structural comparison with CalA clearly demonstrates that the lid domain has been functionally converted into a plant cell wall–degrading esterase by engineering a distinct substrate recognition tunnel. This is a remarkable example of acquisition of a specialized function for increased proficiency in plant pathogenesis using an existing scaffold to act on a complex polysaccharide-rich milieu.The BOG-bound structure of LipA defines a clear path and space for substrate entry in the ligand binding domain, an 18-Å-wide opening that narrows to 8 Å near the active site and remains so up to the end of the tunnel. The BOG complex, although obtained fortuitously, suggests that the natural ligand of LipA is very likely to have a stereochemistry resembling monosaccharide-alkyl chain-ester linkage, since the Gly-231 residue found to be important for BOG–LipA interaction also plays a crucial role in the biological activity of LipA. The fact that the mutation of Asn-228 does not affect BOG binding while it disrupts in planta activity of LipA shows that there are differences between BOG and the natural ligand of LipA. Also supporting this architecture of the natural ligand is the fact that β-octyl galactoside shows much weaker binding to LipA in ITC experiments compared with BOG, indicating that LipA has a higher specificity for β-d-glucoside compared with β-d-galactoside. Therefore, mechanistically, LipA might act on an amphiphilic molecule with a glucose (or perhaps, xylose) moiety attached to a long (substituted) acyl chain (or aryl ring) of a length of 16 to 18 carbons (∼30 Å) with an ester bond situated ∼15 Å from the sugar ring. Presence of an aliphatic chain in the natural ligand is indicated by the stretch of hydrophobic residues lining the LipA ligand binding tunnel just below the carbohydrate anchor site as well as by the activity of LipA on pNP acyl esters.LipA could act on alkyl ester cross-links between long polysaccharide chains, which need to be cleaved to make the polysaccharide chains accessible to other degradative enzymes. LipA may also chew the same chain at several points and thus may be able to accept substrates of varying lengths. Such a compound can be predicted to be a part of the lignin component of the rice cell walls, since short alkyl chains and alkyl groups esterified to aryl moieties are reported in the lignocellulosic cross-links that connect the polysaccharide chains (reviewed in Buranov and Mazza, 2008). Several cyclo-alkyl rings linked to glucose, for example, furostanol glucosides, have been identified from plant cell walls and are possible candidates for LipA action (Arthan et al., 2006). A comparison with the inhibitor-bound structures of other hydrolases in the PDB indicates that, upon binding to the substrate binding tunnel in LipA, the carboxylate part of the ester would probably occupy the tunnel while the alcohol part would hang out of the enzyme. The alcohol part of the ester can be of varied characteristics since the LipA tunnel opens very wide toward the BOG2 binding site. Existing knowledge of the precise ester-linked polymers in plant cell walls, especially rice, is limited owing to their enormous complexity (Carpita, 1996; Somerville et al., 2004; Knox, 2008). However, as our understanding of the architecture of the plant cell wall improves, clarity on the selectivity aspect of LipA function mediated by the substrate binding pocket will also increase.Our study clearly demonstrates that the disruption of either the catalytic Ser or the sugar-anchoring site 15 Å away leads to the abrogation of LipA in planta functions. Therefore, LipA function requires grabbing a cell wall component in the ligand binding tunnel and cleaving the ester linkage at the active site, illustrating the existence of a crucial functional interplay between these two distinct regions of the molecule. The cell wall damage and/or release of soluble elicitors is a cue for induction of host innate defense responses, and a loss of LipA activity leads to an inability to provoke these responses. This substantiates the earlier observations showing that heat-inactivated LipA failed to induce rice innate immunity (Jha et al., 2007). Therefore, the result of LipA action, and not the LipA molecule itself, is required for eliciting rice responses like PCD and callose deposition. Contrastingly, fungal xylanases can elicit plant defense responses through physically binding to a plant receptor (Ron and Avni, 2004).LipA-mediated Xoo pathogenesis is dependent on the presence of the substrate recognition module. It is highly probable that the whole genus Xanthomonas employs this mode of substrate recognition for proficient pathogenesis. The carbohydrate binding domain of LipA is very distinct compared with the carbohydrate binding modules in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (Cantarel, 2008). In general, noncatalytic carbohydrate binding modules are reported to enhance the activity of their catalytic counterparts by facilitating substrate proximity and increasing the efficiency of substrate binding in plants (Boraston et al., 2004). Our data clearly show that the LipA substrate binding domain is an essential modular noncatalytic domain appended to the catalytic hydrolase to recognize alkyl glycoside substrates where the ester bond is located quite far away (15 Å) from the sugar binding site. Taking into account the absence of structural homologs for the glycoside recognition domain and its conservation across the Xanthomonas group, LipA-like proteins constitute a new class of cell wall–degrading enzymes with a unique mode of substrate recognition. Identification or generation of such distinct plant biomass-degrading enzymes is an active area of research (Gilbert et al., 2008). Addition of LipA-like enzymes to the existing cell wall–degrading enzymatic preparations provides a new dimension for the production of clean eco-friendly biofuels from agricultural waste and other sources of plant material.The LipA substrate binding domain may have been acquired by a common ancestor of Xanthomonas and Xylella strains from evolutionarily distant but ecologically coexisting nonpathogenic bacteria like the soil/plant-associated Burkholderia and fine-tuned to act on carbohydrate-linked carboxylic esters. Diverse complex polysaccharides esterified to largely uncharacterized phenolics and aliphatics dominate the plant and soil interface environments, perhaps enforcing evolution of such specializations in the hydrolase fold. Our study offers a glimpse into a plant habitat-specific adaptation of the common esterase activity and provides a solid platform to study secretory esterases from several other important pathogenic bacteria. It might also provide an opportunity to create a battery of small molecule inhibitors for this family of enzymes, which could be developed for potential application in crop fields.The overexpression, purification, and crystallization of LipA was reported by Aparna et al. (2007). Briefly, for overexpression of LipA in its secreted form, a pHM1 expression construct in which the gene is cloned under the constitutive lac promoter in Xoo strain BXO2008, was used (primers listed in Supplemental Table 4 online). The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the culture supernatant of BXO2008 using cation exchange and size exclusion chromatography and crystallized at a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 at 298K in two types of monoclinic crystals differing in unit cell dimensions. Plate-shaped type I crystals were obtained in 48% PEG 400, 0.10 M MES, pH 6.0, and diffracted to 1.89 Å resolution. The unit cell parameters were found to be a = 93.1, b = 62.3, c = 66.1 Å, and β = 90.8°. The rod-shaped type II crystals have unit cell parameters of a = 103.6, b = 54.6, c = 66.3Å, and β = 92.6°. The crystals were obtained from a reservoir solution containing 12% PEG 6000 and 0.10 M MES, pH 6.7, and diffracted to 1.86 Å resolution (Aparna et al., 2007). LipA structure was solved by the Multiple Isomorphous Replacement method. The type II crystals, being more reproducible, were used for heavy atom derivatization. A high-throughput crystallization facility (Alchemist screen making system and Minstrel High-throughput crystal imaging system [Rigaku]; Matrix Hydra eDrop [Thermo Fisher Scientific]) was used to prepare crystallization solutions and generate several LipA crystals for heavy atom derivatization. Isomorphous crystals soaked in heavy atoms (Hampton) like 10 mM K2PtCl2 for 2 to 15 min and 10 mM Sm (NO3)2 soaks of 20 to 25 min were used for heavy atom substitution. Long soaks of 1 h were used for the Hg salt thimerosol to obtain substitution.LipA sequence was predicted to contain a signal-peptide cleavage site between residues 29 and 30 by the software SIGNAL-P. LipA was purified as indicated above, resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and electrotransferred using ECL semidry transfer unit (Amersham Biosciences) on a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The band of 39 kD corresponding to LipA detected after Ponceau Red staining of the blot was excised and subjected to Edman N-terminal sequencing using a Procise cLC N-terminal amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems) as per the manufacturer's instructions. N-terminal sequencing confirmed the cleavage of a 29–amino acid signal peptide, and the corresponding electron density could not be detected. Electron density for the first residue after the signal peptide (residue 1) and the region from residues 28 to 36 was not detected in the LipA structure solved using either crystal forms.The heavy atom soaked crystal data (see Supplemental Table 3 online) were collected on an in-house MAR Research MAR345dtb image plate detector using Cu Kα x-rays of wavelength 1.54 Å generated by a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating-anode generator. Data were processed using the HKL package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The SOLVE run with four Pt, one Sm, and one Hg data sets gave a figure of merit 0.45 and Z score 40 (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999). Phase extension and improvement was performed using DM (Cowtan, 1994). RESOLVE could build only 150 Ala residues and 30 side chain residues out of 397 expected amino acids (Terwilliger, 2003). Iterative rounds of chain building using the experimental map for the rest of the 217 residues and RESOLVE runs for localized loop building were performed. The structure was refined using CNS. Structure visualization and a part of model building were done using the software O (Jones et al., 1991). The final structure was refined to R/Rfree values of 16.1/18.7% at 1.86 Å resolution. Data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 2. The LipA wild-type crystals were soaked with several detergents, and hydrophobic ligands from Hampton additive screen and BOG-bound crystals were obtained using a concentration of 17.5 mM ligand. Molecular replacement using MOLREP (Computational Collaborative Project, Number 4, 1994) on the data set of the BOG-bound crystal resulted in two molecules of BOG binding in the LipA structure. This structure was refined to R/Rfree of 18.8/23.2%, respectively, at 2.1 Å resolution. A similar concentration of BOG and 3 mg mL−1 concentrations of purified proteins of mutants G231F and N228W were used to obtain the mutant cocrystals. Both structures were also solved using molecular replacement as described above. PROCHECK was used to assess the stereochemistry of the structures.Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsModeling of LipA homologs was done using Modeller9v4 software (Marti-Renom et al., 2000). The DALI server was used for structural homology searches (Sali and Blundell, 1993). The NCBI BLAST server was used for identifying sequence homologs, ClustalW (EBI server) for multiple sequence alignments, and MEGA v.4 was used for preparing phylogenetic trees and bootstrap analysis (Altschul et al., 1990; Thompson et al., 1994; Tamura et al., 2007). MOLE was used as a PYMOL plugin to visualize the tunnel (Petrek et al., 2007).The in vitro binding of BOG to LipA and the LipA point mutants was measured by ITC using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal). ITC Buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl) was used for diluting the protein and dissolving BOG. All samples were degassed prior to titration. The 40 μM protein sample (1.8 mL) was titrated against 150 μL of 2 mM BOG over 50 injections at 303K. The change in heat of the proteins upon titrating with BOG was measured, integrated, and fitted into a one-site binding model for calculation of Ka, ΔHapp, and TΔS using the Origin 7.0 software (MicroCal) for curve fitting and data analysis. The parameters Kd and ΔG were calculated using formulae Kd = Ka−1 and ΔG = ΔH – TΔS, respectively. The heat of dilution of BOG was measured by a blank titration of ligand into the buffer, and this was subtracted from the binding isotherms of the wild-type and mutant proteins. The β-octyl galactoside titration was also performed similarly, and a sequential two-site model was used to fit the raw data in this case. Overall Kd for β-octyl galactoside was calculated using the equation 1/√K1K2 where K1 was 8.8×103 and K2 was 230.The lipA gene was cloned into the pBSKS plasmid (Stratagene) and mutated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene; primers listed in Supplemental Table 4 online). The mutant lipA genes were excised as KpnI-HindIII fragments, cloned into the multicloning site of broad-host range vector pHM1, and transformed into Xoo strain BXO2001 that has an insertion mutation in the lipA gene (Innes et al., 1988; Rajeshwari et al., 2005). Presence of the lipA point mutations was confirmed by sequencing of the LipA gene from each strain. Expression of mutant LipA proteins was confirmed using rabbit polyclonal anti-LipA antibodies generated in this study at 1:5000 dilution and 1:10,000 dilution of anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase–conjugated goat IgG from Sigma-Aldrich. As described previously, Xoo strain BXO2008 containing the lipA gene on the broad-host range vector pHM1 was used as a source of wild-type LipA (Aparna et al., 2007). The LipA mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity using similar protocols.Tributyrin (C4), tricaproin (C6), tricaprylin (C8), tricaprin (C10), trilaurin (C12), and tripalmitin (C16) (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as substrates in plate assays for LipA activity (Smeltzer et al., 1992). Briefly, 0.5% suspensions of the triglyceride substrates were prepared in a buffer containing 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mM CaCl2, sonicated at 30 W for 3 min to emulsify the substrates, mixed with an equal volume of 2% agarose solution and solidified in Petri plates. Fifty microliters of 0.5 mg mL−1 of purified wild-type and mutant LipA proteins were added to the wells cut into each substrate plate and assayed for a zone of clearance. Triolein (C18:1) activity was assayed using the olive oil-rhodamine B plate assay (Kouker and Jaeger, 1987). In this assay, 2.5% ultrapure olive oil and 0.001% fluorescent Rhodamine B dye were mixed with 1% agarose solution, emulsified using sonication at 30 W for 3 min, and solidified in a Petri plate. Subsequently, 50 μl of 0.5 mg mL−1 of purified wild-type LipA was added to the wells cut into the plate and assayed for appearance of a zone of clearance. All assays were performed at room temperature.LipA substrate specificity on pNP esters was determined using a spectrophotometric assay with pNP acetate (-C2), pNP butyrate (pNP-C4), pNP caprylate (-C8), pNP caprate (-C10), pNP laurate (-C12), pNP myristate (-C14), pNP palmitate (-C16), and pNP stearate (-C18) as substrates. The spectroscopic assays were performed at OD405 after a 10-min incubation of the substrates with LipA in 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Further assessment of the optimal LipA activity was done using pNP butyrate (pNP-C4) as the substrate over 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 5.5 to 9.0, and at various temperatures between 10 and 70°C. LipA enzyme kinetics (see Supplemental Figure 7 online) was also performed using pNP butyrate (pNP-C4) in 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, at room temperature. Eight different substrate concentrations (between 10 μM and 1 mM) were used to determine the initial rate of reaction of the enzyme.The following Xoo strains were used for virulence analysis: BXO43 (wild-type strain; rifampicin resistant), BXO2001 (lipA1∷bla; Ampr derivative of BXO43; Lip− insertion mutant), BXO2008 (lipA1∷bla; pHM1-lipA+; Specr Ampr derivative of BXO2001), and lipA point mutations expressed using pHM1 in the BXO2001 background (Rajeshwari et al., 2005). These strains were grown to saturation in peptone-sucrose medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. The cultures were pelleted down by centrifugation and resuspended in sterile water (3 mL) at a concentration of ∼109 cells/mL. Surgical scissors dipped in these bacterial suspensions were used to clip the leaf tips of greenhouse-grown, 40-d-old plants of the Taichung Native-1 (TN-1) rice variety, which is susceptible to Xoo (Kauffman et al., 1973). Lesion lengths were measured 7 d after inoculation.Purified wild-type and mutant LipA proteins (0.1 mg mL−1) were infiltrated into leaves of 10-d-old TN-1 rice seedlings using the blunt end of a 1-mL syringe as described (Jha et al., 2007). Fourteen hours later, the infiltrated zone (∼1 × 1 cm) was cut from the leaf, destained with 70% ethanol at 65°C, stained with 0.5% aniline blue for 4 h, and observed under an Axioplan2 epifluorescence microscope using a blue filter (excitation wavelength of 365 nm) and ×10 objective (Hauck et al., 2003).Seeds of TN-1 rice cultivar were germinated on 0.5% sterile agar in Petri dishes. After 2 to 3 d, root tips (∼0.5 cm) were excised from the seedlings and treated with 0.5 mg mL−1 of either the wild-type and mutant LipA proteins or buffer (10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0). After incubation for 16 h, roots were washed and stained with 1 mg mL−1 PI for 20 min and mounted in 50% glycerol on glass slides. The samples were observed under an LSM-510 Meta Confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) using ×63 oil immersion objectives and He-Ne laser at 514-nm excitation as described (Jha et al., 2007).The full-length wild-type LipA protein was used to generate anti-LipA polyclonal antibodies in rabbit. Preimmune serum was collected from the uninjected animal to serve as a negative control for the antibodies following subdermal injection of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5 mg mL−1 of the protein and Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) and a booster dose of the same composition 10 d later. The serum containing the polyclonal antibodies was collected 15 d after the booster dose and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min to remove blood cells. Expression of mutant LipA proteins was confirmed using anti-LipA serum at 1:5000 dilution and 1:10,000 dilution of anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase–conjugated goat IgG from Sigma-Aldrich.Coordinates and structure factors of the two wild-type LipA, BOG-bound LipA, G231F, and N228W mutant structures have been deposited at the PDB with codes 3H2G, 3H2J, 3H2K, 3H2H, and 3H2I, respectively.

PMC2719112,"Activation of β-Glucan Synthases by Wall-Bound Purple Acid Phosphatase in Tobacco Cells1,[W][OA]",False,"Wall-bound purple acid phosphatases have been shown to be potentially involved in the regulation of plant cell growth. The aim of this work was to further investigate the function of one of these phosphatases in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), NtPAP12, using transgenic cells overexpressing the enzyme. The transgenic cells exhibited a higher level of phosphatase activity in their walls. The corresponding protoplasts regenerating a cell wall exhibited a higher rate of β-glucan synthesis and cellulose deposition was increased in the walls of the transgenic cells. A higher level of plasma membrane glucan synthase activities was also measured in detergent extracts of membrane fractions from the transgenic line, while no activation of Golgi-bound glycan synthases was detected. Enzymatic hydrolysis and methylation analysis were performed on the products synthesized in vitro by the plasma membrane enzymes from the wild-type and transgenic lines extracted with digitonin and incubated with radioactive UDP-glucose. The data showed that the glucans consisted of callose and cellulose and that the amount of each glucan synthesized by the enzyme preparation from the transgenic cells was significantly higher than in the case of the wild-type cells. The demonstration that callose and cellulose synthases are activated in cells overexpressing the wall-bound phosphatase NtPAP12 suggests a regulation of these carbohydrate synthases by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process, as well as a role of wall-bound phosphatases in the regulation of cell wall biosynthesis.Plant cell walls contain acid phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.2) that are potentially involved in regulating cell growth processes. Recently, we suggested that the wall-bound purple acid phosphatase NtPAP12 from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) functions as a protein phosphatase (Kaida et al., 2008) and promotes cellulose synthesis (Sano et al., 2003). Its transcription level was significantly increased in protoplasts during wall regeneration (Kaida et al., 2003). Interestingly, addition of the phosphatase to the protoplasts accelerated β-glucan deposition, whereas the addition of antibodies directed against the phosphatase prevented β-glucan deposition (Sano et al., 2003). Part of the β-glucans formed by tobacco protoplasts during the early stage of wall regeneration consist of β-1,4-glucans (Shea et al., 1989). It was hypothesized that the same enzyme may be involved in the biosynthesis of callose and cellulose and that the biosynthesis of either polysaccharide may be controlled by phosphorylation (Delmer, 1999). However, experimental data showed that the cellulose and callose synthase catalytic subunits are encoded by different genes (Pear et al., 1996; Arioli et al., 1998; Cui et al., 2001; Doblin et al., 2001; Hong et al., 2001a; Li et al., 2003; Brownfield et al., 2007). Indeed, these proteins show no significant sequence similarity and are grouped in different glycosyltransferase families in the CAZY database (http://www.cazy.org), family 2 for cellulose synthase and family 48 for callose synthase (Cantarel et al., 2009). Thus, it is currently admitted that callose and cellulose synthases correspond to two different enzyme proteins. Notwithstanding the existence of two different enzymes catalyzing the polymerization of callose and cellulose, it is possible that the two activities are coregulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, but this remains to be demonstrated. Several putative cytoplasmic phosphorylation sites have been identified in cellulose synthase in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) using a phosphoproteomics approach (Nühse et al., 2004) but their regulatory function was not determined. A more recent report on the identification of the phosphorylation sites of AtCesA7, which is a cellulose synthase subunit involved in secondary cell wall formation in Arabidopsis, points toward a role of phosphorylation events in regulating the turnover of cellulose synthase by proteolysis through a proteasome-dependent pathway (Taylor, 2007). The implication of phosphorylation in the regulation of β-glucan synthases has also been proposed in pea (Pisum sativum) stems (Ray, 1973). In addition, sodium fluoride, which inhibits the action of phosphoprotein phosphatases was shown to increase by 5-fold β-glucan synthase activity from corn (Zea mays) in the presence of Ca2+, possibly in a calmodulin-dependent manner (Paliyath and Poovaiah, 1988). Overall, phosphorylation seems to play an important role in the regulation of the activities of plant β-glucan synthases, including cellulose synthase, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and resulting effects are poorly understood.To shed light on the possible function of NtPAP12 in the regulation of β-glucan and cellulose biosynthesis, expression of the phosphatase was induced at the early stage of wall regeneration in tobacco protoplasts (Kaida et al., 2003). Here we have exploited this system to demonstrate both in vivo and in vitro that overexpression of NtPAP12 activates the plasma membrane-bound cellulose and callose synthases, while Golgi β-glucan synthases and xyloglucan xylosyltransferases were not affected. Our work reveals that NtPAP12 is involved in the regulation of callose and cellulose synthases and, indirectly, in cell growth and morphogenesis.To determine the localization of NtPAP12 in protoplasts undergoing cell wall regeneration, an aliquot of the protoplast suspension overexpressing the phosphatase gene was transferred to a coverslip coated with polylysine and incubated in the medium for wall regeneration. At the early stages of regeneration (0–60 min), the cells were subjected to lysis with a low osmotic buffer to obtain immobilized disc-shaped protoplast ghosts designated as plasma membrane sheets (Hirai et al., 1998). A double detection based on immunofluorescence labeling of purple acid phosphatase and Calcofluor White staining of β-glucans was subsequently performed. Fluorescence microscopy showed that the purple acid phosphatase could be visualized between the plasma membrane sheets and the polylysine-coated coverslip immediately after the beginning of the incubation, and its deposition increased with incubation time (Fig. 1). β-Glucan microstructures had also been formed on the plasma membrane sheets between the sheets and the polylysine-coated coverslip (Fig. 1). The β-glucan stained with Calcofluor White first emerged as dots at many loci within a few minutes after the beginning of the incubation, and short microstructures, most likely microfibril aggregates, were clearly visible after about 15 min of incubation. Merged images showed that phosphatase deposition and β-glucan formation seem to occur near the surface of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). A series of optical section images were recorded using steps of 0.6 μm depth from the membrane to the outside of the walls (Fig. 2). Purple acid phosphatase was detected in the walls with a higher intensity in the sections closest to the membrane. The intensity of the signal gradually decreased in the outer layers of the scan. It seems likely that the phosphatase is essentially present in close proximity to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). The β-glucan microstructures appeared to be uniformly distributed at the surface of the membrane and formed a 3-μm thick extracellular layer (Fig. 2).Deposition of purple acid phosphatase (PAP) and β-glucan on plasma membrane sheets during time course. Plasma membrane sheets were prepared from protoplasts cultured in the wall-regeneration medium for 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Purple acid phosphatase was detected with anti-wall-bound purple acid phosphate antibodies and β-glucan was stained with Calcofluor White. Each image was joined from five 0.6 μm optical section images. Bar = 50 μm.Series of optical section images (0.6 μm) from the plasma membrane surface to the outer part of the cell wall. Plasma membrane sheets were prepared from protoplasts cultured in the wall-regeneration medium for 30 min. Purple acid phosphatase (PAP) was detected using anti-wall-bound purple acid phosphate antibody and β-glucan was stained with Calcofluor. Bar = 50 μm.We produced transgenic tobacco cells (XD-6) that overexpressed NtPAP12 under the control of an enhanced constitutive promoter, the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Mitsuhara et al., 1996), to study the role of purple acid phosphatase in the walls of tobacco cells. Transgenic cells overexpressing NtPAP12 and wild-type cells at logarithmic phase were harvested and the levels of expression of the enzyme were measured by both western blot using antiphosphatase antibodies and assaying phosphatase activity. Considerably more of the 220-kD polypeptide was present in the walls of the transgenic cells than in those of the wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). Although the amount of the 120-kD polypeptide in the walls of the transgenic and wild-type cells was comparable, as judged by western blotting, the amount of the 220-kD polypeptide was significantly higher in the walls of the transgenic cells compared to those of the wild-type cells. The phosphatase occurs as a 120-kD dimer composed of two subunits of 60 kD in the Golgi, and this dimer is translocated to the walls where it forms a tetramer of 220 kD (Kaida et al., 2008). The activity of the phosphatase was 20-fold higher in the walls of the transgenic cells compared to the wild-type cells (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the induction of NtPAP12 during wall regeneration (Kaida et al., 2003), the level of the 220-kD polypeptide was rather high in the regenerating walls of the wild-type cells and even higher in those of the transgenic cells (Fig. 3). The levels of activity in the nascent walls on the protoplasts overexpressing NtPAP12 doubled at the early stage of the regeneration compared to those in the wild-type protoplasts (Fig. 3D).Expression levels of purple acid phosphatase (PAP) and acid phosphatase activities in the transgenic cells overexpressing NtPAP12 and in the wild-type cells. SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions was performed on 20 μg of wall proteins prepared from cells at a logarithmic growth phase (A) or from protoplasts regenerating walls for 30 min (B). In each case, immunoblot analysis was performed using rabbit anti-wall-bound purple acid phosphatase antibody. C and D, Acid phosphatase activity in the walls from suspension-cultured tobacco cells at the exponential phase (C) or from protoplasts at the early stage of wall regeneration (D). White circles, Wild-type protoplasts; black circles, transgenic protoplasts overexpressing NtPAP12. The activity values represent the mean of three incubation mixtures for each reaction with individual values varying from the mean by <5%.β-Glucan formed at the surface of the protoplasts overexpressing NtPAP12 as judged by Calcofluor White staining (Supplemental Fig. S1). The amount of polysaccharide synthesized by the transgenic protoplasts after 60 min regeneration were about 2-fold higher than in the case of the wild-type protoplasts (Table I). Based on methylation analysis, terminal, 3-linked, and 4-linked Glcs were each increased in the regenerated walls of the transgenic cells compared to wild-type cells, by factors of 1.8, 2.4, and 1.7, respectively (Table II). This indicates that the expression of the phosphatase was accompanied by enhanced β-glucan deposition, during which β-glucan synthases might be activated. In suspension-cultured cells the overexpression of NtPAP12 provoked an increase of cellulose deposition during cell growth compared to the wild-type cells, while the pectin content was slightly decreased (Supplemental Fig. S2). Altogether these results demonstrate that overexpression of NtPAP12 increased callose and cellulose deposition in tobacco cells.Amount of extracellular polysaccharides formed by protoplasts at 60 h after onset of wall regenerationTotal polysaccharides of cell walls isolated from wild-type and transgenic protoplasts, and total polysaccharides secreted by wild-type and transgenic protoplasts into the cell wall regeneration medium were determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (see “Materials and Methods”). Average and sd values were obtained from three different experiments. PAP, Purple acid phosphatase.Sugar linkages of polysaccharides from the regenerated walls of protoplastsGlycosyl linkages were determined as methylated alditolacetates by gas-liquid chromatography. Average and sd values were obtained from three different experiments. PAP, Purple acid phosphatase.To further investigate whether the overexpression of NtPAP12 is accompanied by higher callose and cellulose synthase activities in vitro, we measured the activity of glucan synthases in digitonin extracts of microsomal preparations from transgenic and wild-type tobacco cells. Glucan synthase activities increased with increasing amounts of membrane proteins in the assay mixture for both enzyme preparations (Fig. 4A). However, after 10 min incubation of the detergent extracts in the presence of UDP-Glc, the incorporation of Glc into glucans was twice as high in the case of the transgenic cells at any protein concentration tested (Fig. 4A). The Glc incorporation was also systematically higher during the time course in the case of the detergent extracts from the transgenic cells (Fig. 4B). In particular, glucan formation from enzyme extracts from the transgenic cells was about 2-fold higher during the initial phase of incorporation and 2.7-fold higher at the extent of incorporation, compared to wild-type cells.In vitro synthesis of β-glucans and product characterization. A, Reaction performed in the presence of variable amounts of protein during 10 min in conditions favoring cellulose biosynthesis (see “Materials and Methods”). White circles, Wild type; black circles, cells overexpressing purple acid phosphatase (PAP).

Ten micrograms of protein was used for each reaction. White circles, wild type; black circle, cells overexpressing purple acid phosphatase. The values represent the mean of three incubation mixtures for each reaction with individual values varying from the mean by <5%. C, Paper chromatography of the enzymatic hydrolysates (cellulase) corresponding to the β-glucans synthesized in vitro in conditions favoring cellulose biosynthesis. 14C-Polysaccharides formed from UDP-[14C]Glc were precipitated with 70% ethanol containing 1 mm EDTA and washed four times with ethanol. Radioactive products (278 Bq) were used for the wild-type and the transgenic cells. Arrows 1, 2, 3, and 4 indicate the position of Glc, laminaribiose, cellobiose, and cellotriose, respectively. D, Thin-layer chromatography of the methylated alditol acetates corresponding to the glucans synthesized in vitro. Radioactive products treated by the acetic/nitric acid reagent were used for the wild-type (56 Bq) and the transgenic cells (111 Bq). Arrows 5 and 6 indicate 3-linked Glc and 4-linked Glc, respectively.To confirm the nature of the reaction products, the insoluble material obtained from the in vitro synthesis experiment was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis with a cellulase and the hydrolysate was analyzed by paper chromatography. The analysis revealed that the hydrolysate corresponding to the glucans from the transgenic cells contained significantly higher amounts of cellobiose and cellotriose compared to the situation in wild-type cells (Fig. 4C). Laminaribiose was also faintly observed in the hydrolysates. In addition, the overall amount of glucan synthesized was significantly higher for the transgenic cells than for the wild-type cells, thereby confirming the results obtained prior to product characterization (Fig. 4, A and B). Altogether these results showed that the phosphatase significantly accelerated the synthesis of β-1,4-glucan together with callose.The glucan products after treatment with the acetic acid/nitric acid (Updegraff) reagent (Updegraff, 1969) were also subjected to methylation analysis and the resulting permethylated alditol acetates were analyzed by paper chromatography (Fig. 4D). The alditol acetate characteristic of 4-linked Glc (1,4,5-tri-O-acetyl-2,3,6-tri-O-methyl-d-glucitol) was detected in the preparations obtained from both the wild-type and the transgenic cells. The intensity of the spot was about twice as high in the case of the product from the transgenic cells compared to that of the wild-type cells (Fig. 4D). This confirms a higher synthesis of cellulose in the transgenic cells. Altogether these data indicated that cellulose synthase activity was higher in the cells overexpressing NtPAP12.To further analyze the extent of activation of glucan synthases from different types of membranes, we fractionated the microsomal fraction into intracellular and plasma membranes and measured glucan synthase activities in preparations from both the wild-type and the transgenic cells (Table III). In agreement with the data presented above, the activity of callose synthase, which is located in the plasma membrane and catalyzes the incorporation of Glc from UDP-Glc into 1,3-β-glucan (glucan synthase II), was 1.8-fold higher in the preparation from the transgenic cells than in the preparation from wild-type cells. However, no difference in activity was observed for the Golgi-located 1,4-β-glucan synthase (glucan synthase I) or xyloglucan xylosyltransferase, which shows that the overexpression of NtPAP12 did not affect glycan synthases from the Golgi membranes. The phosphatase instead promotes the activities of callose and cellulose synthases (Tables II and III; Fig. 4), which are located in the plasma membrane.β-Glucan synthase activities in the Golgi and plasma membranes fractionated from total microsomal fractionsAverage and sd values were obtained from three different experiments. PAP, Purple acid phosphatase.Our data demonstrate that the activities of callose and cellulose synthases are enhanced by the overexpression of the wall-bound purple acid phosphatase in tobacco cells. This is supported by several lines of evidence: (1) the transgenic protoplasts regenerating a cell wall exhibit a higher rate of β-glucan synthesis; (2) the higher level of phosphatase activity in the walls of the transgenic cells is correlated with a higher level of glucan synthase activities in detergent extracts of microsomal fractions; (3) the higher glucan synthase activities observed in the transgenic line are specific for the plasma membrane, whereas no activation of Golgi-bound glycan synthases was detected; and (4) product characterization based on enzymatic hydrolysis and methylation analysis unequivocally demonstrates that the glucans synthesized in vitro by the detergent extracts from both the wild-type and transgenic cells are callose and cellulose, and that the amount of each glucan synthesized by the enzyme preparation from the transgenic cells is higher than that synthesized by the fraction from the wild-type cells. It seems likely that callose synthase activity is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. It remains, however, to determine whether the phosphorylation event occurs directly on the callose synthase catalytic subunit or on another protein that itself controls callose synthase activity. A number of proteins have been identified to be potentially involved in the regulation of callose synthases; they could be the target of NtPAP12. These include phragmoplastin, the GTP-binding protein Rop1, and a UDP-glucosyltransferase potentially associated to the callose synthase complex (Hong et al., 2001a, 2001b). However, the localization of Rop1 on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane is not compatible with the localization of the product of the NtPAP12 gene, which is located in the cell wall. In addition, phragmoplastin is thought to interact only with the callose synthase complex responsible for cell plate formation (Hong et al., 2001a) while our data suggest a general activation of callose synthase activity in protoplasts regenerating a cell wall. Similarly, in the case of cellulose synthase, the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process may occur directly on the catalytic subunit itself. This is supported by the identification of several phosphorylation sites in cellulose synthases from Arabidopsis (Nühse et al., 2004). However, these sites were predicted to be located on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, which is not compatible with the cell wall localization of NtPAP12. The identification of phosphorylation sites in cellulose synthase was also reported for AtCesA7, which is involved in secondary cell wall formation in Arabidopsis (Taylor, 2007). The data point toward a role of phosphorylation in regulating the turnover of cellulose synthase by proteolysis through a proteasome-dependent pathway (Taylor, 2007), which again implies a cytoplasmic phosphorylation event. Thus, the information available to date combined with our present data suggest that the wall-bound NtPAP12 phosphatase from tobacco is involved in the regulation of the cellulose synthase activity by acting on an unidentified membrane protein, which may lead to the promotion of cellulose synthesis. NtPAP12 was shown to be secreted to the wall via the classical secretion pathway involving Golgi vesicles (Sano et al., 2003; Kaida et al., 2008). Since the levels of Golgi-located glycosyltransferases were not affected in the tobacco cells overexpressing NtPAP12, it can be hypothesized either that NtPAP12 is not functional in the Golgi but only in its final destination, i.e. the cell wall, or that the Golgi-bound glycosyltransferases are not regulated by phosphorylation. Further work is needed to demonstrate whether NtPAP12 is involved in the coregulation of callose and cellulose synthases as suggested earlier (Delmer, 1999).Arabidopsis contains a large family of purple acid phosphatases, which is composed of 29 genes, 28 of which have signal peptides that are potentially involved in the transfer of the proteins to the wall and/or vacuole. As the amino acid sequence of NtPAP12 is most similar to that of AtPAP10 (amino acid identity higher than 80%), the analysis of the corresponding knockout plants is in progress in our laboratory to further characterize the function of these proteins.The tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cell line XD-6 derived from tobacco var. Xanthi and the transgenic cells overexpressing NtPAP12 (Kaida et al., 2003) under the S35 constitutive promoter were cultured in 40 mL of Murashige and Skoog medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing 3% Suc and 4.5 μm 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in 100-mL flasks. The flasks were shaken at 110 rpm at 25°C for 10 d.NtPAP12 was amplified from tobacco cDNA (Kaida et al., 2003) by PCR using a forward primer (5′-CTGGATCCTGGTGTGCAAAAATGGGTGTG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TTCACGATTTGGTTACCATGGACTC-3′). Next, the cDNA was digested with BamHI and SacI, then introduced into the binary vector under the control of an enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Mitsuhara et al., 1996), and the plasmid was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404.The transformation of tobacco cells was performed according to the method described previously (An, 1985). Tobacco cells (cell line XD-6) were cocultivated with the bacteria for 4 d at 26°C. Then the cells were cultured in 40 mL of Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 500 μg/mL cefotaxime. When the culture reached the stationary phase, 3 mL of culture was transferred to fresh medium supplemented with 200 μg/mL kanamycin and 500 μg/mL cefotaxime. After an additional 10 culture cycles in the selective medium, we established a transgenic cell line that had been cultured more than 200 times in the presence of 50 μg/mL kanamycin. During inoculation, the phosphatase activity was always determined using phosphotyrosine as a substrate. The specific activity of phosphatase was always more than 20-fold higher for the transgenic cells (0.3 unit/mg total proteins) than for the wild-type cells (0.014 unit/mg total proteins) over a period of 5 years. All of the following experiments were performed using a culture medium devoid of antibiotics.Protoplasts were obtained by digestion of cell walls of suspension-cultured tobacco cells with 1.5% (w/v) cellulase (Cellulase Onozuka RS, Yakult) and 0.05% (w/v) pectolyase Y-23 (Seishin Pharmaceutical) in the presence of 0.48 m mannitol at pH 5.2 for 40 min. The protoplasts were filtered through a 60-μm nylon mesh and purified by sedimentation through 13.7% Suc solution at 170g for 1 min. Then, they were washed with 0.48 m mannitol and cultured in a medium for cell wall regeneration (Nagata and Takebe, 1970) at a density of 105 protoplasts mL−1 at 26°C, and harvested by centrifugation at 170g for 1 min. The cell wall regeneration medium (pH 5.8) contained 20 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.0 mm KNO3, and 2.0 mm MgSO4 as major component, 1.0 μm KI and 0.01 μm CuSO4 as minor component, 1.0 μg L−1 thiamine, 100 μg L−1 inositol, 2.0 μg L−1 Gly, and 0.48 m mannitol.Localizations of extracellular purple acid phosphatase and β-glucans were determined using plasma membrane sheets (Hirai et al., 1998). The protoplasts were immediately transferred to a coverslip that had been coated with poly-l-Lys (molecular weight 70,000–150,000, Sigma-Aldrich), and covered with the medium for cell wall regeneration. After incubation, the protoplasts were subjected to lysis in 50 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 6.8) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm EGTA, then fixed with 50 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 6.8) containing 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde, 1 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% glycerol. Membrane permeabilization was induced by treatment with 50 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 6.8) containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm MgSO4, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% glycerol for 5 min. Prior to immunostaining, the membrane sheets were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1 m Gly, and 0.05% Triton X-100 for 20 min. Purple acid phosphatase was detected with a rabbit antitobacco purple acid phosphatase antibody and Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated antirabbit IgG (Invitrogen). β-Glucan microfibrils were stained with 0.002% Calcofluor White. The membrane sheets were subsequently embedded in an antifading reagent (SlowFade Light; Invitrogen) and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX50) equipped with a confocal laser-scanning head system (Leica TCSNT).Suspension-cultured tobacco cells were homogenized in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0) buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, using a Teflon-glass homogenizer at 1,500 rpm for 20 min. The wall materials were collected on nylon mesh (pore size, 50 μm) and washed with 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.0) by centrifugation at 5,000g for 20 min. The wall-bound phosphatase was extracted with the same buffer containing 0.7 m NaCl. The extract was concentrated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 65% saturation. Following centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min, the pellet was dissolved with 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.0) and dialyzed against the same buffer.The protoplasts cultured in the medium for cell wall regeneration were harvested by centrifugation at 500g for 2 min and homogenized in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol using a Teflon-glass homogenizer at 1,200 rpm for 3 min. The homogenate was overlaid on 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0) containing 40% Suc and centrifuged at 40,000g for 30 min. The wall fraction (pellet) was collected and washed with 10 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.0) by centrifugation at 10,000g for 15 min. The wall-bound phosphatase was extracted with the same buffer containing 0.7 m NaCl.Twenty micrograms each of wall-bound proteins prepared as described above were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The proteins were electrotransferred to Hybond-ECL (GE Healthcare) and probed first with rabbit anti-wall-bound purple acid phosphatase antibody, then with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Detection was performed using ECL western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare).Phosphatase activity was assayed in a reaction mixture containing the enzyme preparation, 1 mm phosphotyrosine, and 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.8) in a total volume of 0.1 mL. The phosphate released over the course of 3 min at 30°C was assayed according to Van Veldhoven and Mannaerts (1987). One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to produce 1 μmol of phosphate in 1 min at 30°C.Tobacco cells were homogenized in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol using a Teflon-glass homogenizer at 1,400 rpm for 20 min. The homogenates were filtered on a nylon mesh (60 μm). The residue on the nylon mesh was washed five times with 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0; centrifugation at 1,000g for 15 min).The wall fractions were boiled for 3 min and treated with salivary amylase and proteinase K (GibcoBRL). The regenerated wall fractions were subjected to methylation analysis as described below. Carbohydrate contents recovered from growing cells were determined after cell wall fractionation as follows: Pectin and hemicellulose were extracted sequentially five times with 0.1 m EDTA (pH 7.0) at 85°C and five times with 24% (w/w) KOH containing 0.1% NaBH4 at 45°C, respectively. The final insoluble residue corresponding to cellulose was dissolved with ice-cold 72% (w/v) sulfuric acid. Total sugar in each fraction was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (Dubois et al., 1956).The wild-type and transgenic cells (50 g) were homogenized in a mortar using 50 mL of homogenization buffer (50 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m Suc, 10 mm KCl, and 2% bovine serum albumin). The homogenates were centrifuged at 5,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was layered onto 20 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1.6 m Suc (1.6 m Suc buffer) and centrifuged at 200,000g for 20 min. Microsomal membranes were observed as a thin band between the homogenization buffer and the 1.6 m Suc buffer. The membrane fractions were suspended in 20 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.0 containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.4 m Suc, again layered on a 1.6 m Suc buffer, and centrifuged at 200,000g for 20 min. About 1 mL of microsomal membranes was collected. The microsomal membranes from the wild-type cells (4.5 mg protein/mL) and those from the transgenic cells (5.7 mg protein/mL) were subjected to glucan synthase assays.Digitonin extracts were prepared from the microsomal fraction as described elsewhere (Colombani et al., 2004). Cellulose synthase was measured by the method of Lai-Kee-Him et al. (2002). The detergent extracts from microsomal membranes (50 μg of protein/150 μL) were incubated with a mixture of UDP-Glc and UDP-[14C]Glc (6.1 GBq/mol; 1 mm total final concentration), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm cellobiose, and 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8) in a total volume of 200 μL. After incubation for 10 min at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of the Updegraff reagent (80% acetic acid/concentrated nitric acid, 10:1; Updegraff, 1969). The mixture was placed in a boiling water bath for 30 min and the resulting insoluble material was washed three times with water and 1 m acetic acid on disc-glass filters by filtration, and the radioactivity remaining on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation. The proportion of callose and cellulose synthesized in these conditions were determined as described below (see “Sugar Analysis”).Callose synthase in the fractions recovered after fractionation of the microsomal fraction into Golgi and plasma membranes was measured by the method of Van der Woude et al. (1974). The incubation mixture contained 2 μm UDP-[14C]Glc (12.1 GBq/mmol), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm cellobiose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), and the enzyme preparation (100 μg of protein) in a total volume of 20 μL. After incubation for 15 min at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m NaOH. The insoluble material was washed three times with water and 1 m acetic acid on glass filters by filtration and the corresponding radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation.Golgi-bound 1,4-β-glucan synthase was measured by the method of Ordin and Hall (1968). The mixture contained 2 mm UDP-[14C]Glc (12.1 GBq/mol), 0.1 mm cellobiose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), and the enzyme preparation (100 μg of protein) in a total volume of 20 μL. After incubation for 15 min at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m NaOH. The insoluble material was washed three times with water and 1 m acetic acid on disc-glass filters by filtration, and the radioactivity retained on the filters was measured.Xyloglucan 6-α-d-xylosyltransferase activity was determined as described previously (Hayashi et al., 1988). The incubation mixture contained 2 μm UDP-[14C]Xyl (9.7 GBq/mmol), 1 mm MnCl2, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 6.8), and the enzyme preparation (100 μg of protein) in a total volume of 20 μL. After incubation for 15 min at 25°C, the reaction was stopped by heating in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Fifty microliters of carrier soybean (Glycine max) xyloglucan solution containing 100 μg of xyloglucan and 1 mL of 95% ethanol were added to the mixture, and the mixture was stirred and centrifuged. The supernatant was removed, and the precipitate was washed with 70% ethanol. The precipitate was suspended in 1 mL of 50 mm potassium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 1 mg of Aspergillus oryzae enzyme preparation, and incubated for 12 h at 40°C. The reaction was stopped by heating. The mixture was then deionized with Amberlite IR-120 (H+) and concentrated to dryness in vacuo. The digest was analyzed by paper chromatography with 1-propanol/ethyl acetate/water, 3:2:1, as solvent. The area corresponding to isoprimeverose on the paper was cut out and its radioactivity was measured. Units of specific activity were defined as the amounts of [14C]Xyl (pmol) incorporated into isoprimeverose per 15 min, per mg protein.14C-Polysaccharides formed from UDP-[14C]Glc were digested with Streptomyces griceus endocellulase in 20 mm of sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) at 40°C for 48 h. The mixture was then deionized with Amberlite IR-120 (H+) and concentrated to dryness in vacuo. The digest was analyzed by paper chromatography with 1-propanol/ethyl acetate/water, 6:1:2, as solvent.Methylation analysis was carried out as described previously (Hayashi, 1989). Polysaccharides (100 μg) of wall fractions were dissolved in 0.5 mL dimethyl sulfoxide and methyl sulfinyl carbanion (0.5 mL) was added to the mixture. The mixture was agitated in an ultrasonic bath at 45°C for 4 h. Methyl iodide (0.5 mL) was added dropwise during external cooling in ice water. The mixture was again agitated in the ultrasonic bath for 30 min, dialyzed against tap water overnight to remove dimethyl sulfoxide, and concentrated to dryness. The methylated polysaccharide was dissolved in 1.5 mL of 2 m trifluoroacetic acid and hydrolyzed for 1 h at 120°C. The mixture was concentrated to dryness and 1 mL of 0.5 m NaBH4 in 2 m NH4OH was added. After reduction at 60°C for 1 h, the resulting alditols were acetylated according to the method of Blakeney et al. (1983). The partially methylated alditol acetates were separated with a gas chromatography system (Agilent Technologies) using a glass capillary column DB-225 (0.25 mm × 15 m, Agilent Technologies) with temperature rising linearly from 140°C to 190°C at a rate of 2°C min−1. The peaks were identified by mass spectrometry (JMS K9, JEOL). The radioactive acetates were also separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel at 50°C for 80 min using 1-hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid, 6:3:1, as solvent.Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries under accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AB017967"",""term_id"":""27597228"",""term_text"":""AB017967""}}AB017967 (NtPAP12).The following materials are available in the online version of this article.Supplemental Figure S1.

PMC2746802,"Remembering Mary (1917 to 2008): editorial introduction to the thematic series on the life and lifework of Mary Mandels, first lady of cellulase research",False,"Editorial introduction to the thematic series on the life and lifework of Mary Mandels.On 17 February 2008, Mary Mandels passed away, and so ended an era.As I remember Mary, my thoughts race back to the summer of 1994 when I was invited to attend a workshop on the nomenclature of cellulases and other related enzymes, organised by Sharon Shoemaker, which took place in the idyllic setting of Fallen Leaf Lake (Lake Tahoe Basin, CA, USA). Although I had been active in the field for over a decade, this workshop was my first face-to-face meeting with many of my colleagues in the cellulase field, most of whom were destined to become my dear friends. Mary was there, even then long retired, a link to the past...My marathon travel experience from Tel Aviv to Fallen Leaf Lake included a transatlantic flight to JFK airport, New York, followed by a transcontinental flight to San Francisco International Airport. There, I found myself in the United Express annex, a couple of hours before my flight to Sacramento, where hoards of travellers awaited their flights to various obscure cities and towns in California. In true Théâtre de l'Absurde style, flights were announced, overbooked seats negotiated, hustle and bustle, a sea of commotion. I stood on the side, awestruck by the follies and foibles of the human comedy before me. When our flight was announced, we were led by a flag-carrying agent out to the small aircraft in single file and found our seats. I knew we were in trouble when the pilot appeared, scanned the group of passengers, and started pointing at the heftier ones, saying, 'You sit here, you sit over there...' in order to balance out the plane. After a particularly bumpy and uncomfortable ride through the clouds, I found myself in Sacramento. I took a cab to my hotel in Davis, arriving in the late morning hours, knowing I had to find a way to stay awake all day to counter jet lag. I met David Wilson and Tuula Teeri at the hotel and introduced myself to them. Later in the day, I went to the UC Davis campus, and found Roy Doi's office; my first of many happy encounters with Roy. In the evening, I again saw Tuula in the hotel and asked her if she'd like to go to the movies. Somehow, I managed to keep awake until midnight.The next day I found myself among 40 or so strangers, but potential future friends, on the bus towards the Lake Tahoe area. We arrived a couple of hours later at the Stanford Sierra Camp, the site of the workshop. I was assigned to room with Doug Eveleigh, and even if you'd try for years, you could never succeed in finding a friendlier, wittier, more dynamic or colourful roommate! And the meeting itself was laden with friendly, witty, dynamic and colourful personalities.As I walked among the weathered wooden buildings overlooking the beautifully picturesque Fallen Leaf Lake, I was suddenly accosted by Mike Sinnott, who looked quite lost with various types of garbage in his hands. He asked me, 'Do you know where I can find the 'politically correct' trash cans?'I knew then that I was going to fit in and that I was in for an interesting meeting!Other participants at the workshop included Mike Himmel, Bernard Henrissat, Martin Schulein, Jean-Pierre Belaich, Pedro Alzari, Frederic Barras, Jennifer Thomson, Marc Claeyssens, Kunio Ohmiya, Mike Penner and Tony Warren. The discussions focused on how to organise and classify the diverse types of cellulases in nature. The major position of the participants maintained that the cellulases and related enzymes fail to conform to the normal classification schemes, designated by their Enzyme Commission (EC) number as recommended by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB), and that a different approach should be enforced. For the cellulases and related enzymes (the glycoside hydrolases) collectively comprise unique enzyme systems that decompose a unique type of substrate: the intricate conglomerate of plant cell wall polysaccharides. The single major outcome of the meeting was a publication describing a new scheme for classifying the glycoside hydrolases [1], which became a forerunner of the establishment of the CAZy (for 'Carbohydrate-Active enZymes') database [2] and website [3].During a break, we were led down to the lake, where kayaks were available. This was my first experience with kayaking and I took to it naturally, kayaking all over the place with ease. I saw Mike Himmel on the dock watching me. I yelled to him, 'Mike, this is great!' Mike gingerly slipped into a kayak that immediately overturned. Soaked and embarrassed, Mike climbed out of the water back onto the dock to dry out his wallet and its contents. My first impulse was to laugh, and I did so brazenly and without inhibition, while continuing to display my newly found kayaking skills. I don't think I was even conscious of Mike's icy glare. Fortunately, and despite my unforgivable indiscretions, Mike and I have since become true scientific and personal friends, and our friendship has only strengthened greatly through the years.Mary was a calming and modest presence at the meeting. Everyone was conscious of her place in the history of the cellulases. I remember her soft smile. I was fortunate to have my picture taken together with her (Figure ​(Figure11).Mary and me. Mary Mandels (left) and the author at Fallen Leaf Lake, June 1994.Mary's name is indelibly connected to Elwyn T Reese, who isolated the causative agent responsible for the 'jungle rot' that plagued the cotton tents of the allied forces in the South Pacific during World War II. The fungus was identified as Trichoderma 'viride' strain QM 6a, which was later renamed Trichoderma reesei QM 6a, in honour of its discoverer. As fortune would have it, though, the isolate eventually turned out to be a known and separate fungal species (and even genus), and has now been reclassified as Hypocrea jecorina [4], a fungus first described well over a century ago [5]. Honour and recognition are but fleeting gifts. Elwyn never lived to see this turn of fate, but Mary did.Mary's association with Elwyn Reese spanned over a quarter of a century. About half her publications and a quarter of his are common. Their work established the initial types of cellulase assays from scratch, as well as unique approaches to the investigation of microbial degradation of model cellulosic substrates. Many of these assays and approaches are still in use today, half a century later. Mary Mandels and Elwyn T Reese were true pioneers.Today, of course, the renewed 'advent' of the biomass to biofuels initiatives worldwide (and the accompanying funding opportunities) has spawned renewed interest in the cellulases and the microbes which produce them [6-8]. We have witnessed ups and downs in the past several decades; the popularity of the field seems to have been directly related to dramatic events in the Middle East, the price of petroleum and the whims and agendas of foreign powers. For one reason or another, this area has been decidedly underfunded over the years and we have lost many of the groups that have had exquisite expertise in the area of cellulases and their parent micro-organisms. Some scientists have left the area due to lack of funds and the attraction to other 'more popular and profitable' fields, in which the funding potential has been much more productive. Others have succumbed to the effects of time and have retired from science altogether. Nevertheless, still others have remained, captivated by the remarkable qualities of the enzymes and the uniqueness of the bacterial and fungal systems that produce them. In general, the remaining groups have survived by eking out their finances and struggling to keep their labs afloat.The newfound funding opportunities have now attracted both young and more established scientists to the field, who are, by definition, novices. New blood is good for any field, and indeed the funding bodies have responded in kind, with a strong emphasis on new ideas. However, the singularity of these enzymes, the microbes and their ecosystems reign, and to ignore the accumulated knowledge and experience of those scientists who have stubbornly continued in the field over the past several decades would be imprudent, wasteful and counterproductive. Newcomers to the field are constantly misinterpreting their data or rediscovering previously established findings that have been published decades ago, sometimes in obscure places inaccessible to contemporary electronic resources. Novel ideas should be tempered by knowledge and experience.Remembering Mary is to connect ourselves to the onset of the modern era of cellulase research. The thematic series on the life and lifework of Mary Mandels begins with an authoritative historical obituary, which includes vintage pictures of Mary throughout her years at the US Army cellulase laboratory at Natick. This is followed by one of Mary's benchmark publications, and a previously unpublished commentary on Mary's views of the US military establishment after nearly five decades of experience (written over two decades ago). This is Mary talking to us posthumously: again, a voice from the past. Listen to what she has to say! Sound familiar??!! This is not necessarily a commentary on the military establishment per se, but a treatise on our society and human nature in general. One of Mary's seminal articles [9] is also included in this series as a republication, in order to remind newcomers to the field how initial research on cellulase-mediated degradation of cellulosic substrates was converted in a creative way into a science. Other contributions will be limited to authors who have worked on the cellulase system of Trichoderma reesei turned Hypocrea jecorina, many of whom had worked with Mary at one point in their careers, and thus serve as additional direct links to the past. The first of these is an article by Christian Kubicek and colleagues, which summarises the current status of regulation of cellulase biosynthesis in this fungus and outlines strategies for improving cellulase production. The series will be published sporadically over a period of the next several months, the overarching theme of which remains the connection with Mary, her life's work, and the emergence of modern day cellulase research."
PMC2748470,Fungal Bioconversion of Lignocellulosic Residues; Opportunities & Perspectives,False,"The development of alternative energy technology is critically important because of the rising prices of crude oil, security issues regarding the oil supply, and environmental issues such as global warming and air pollution. Bioconversion of biomass has significant advantages over other alternative energy strategies because biomass is the most abundant and also the most renewable biomaterial on our planet. Bioconversion of lignocellulosic residues is initiated primarily by microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria which are capable of degrading lignocellulolytic materials. Fungi such as Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus niger produce large amounts of extracellular cellulolytic enzymes, whereas bacterial and a few anaerobic fungal strains mostly produce cellulolytic enzymes in a complex called cellulosome, which is associated with the cell wall. In filamentous fungi, cellulolytic enzymes including endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases (exoglucanases) and β-glucosidases work efficiently on cellulolytic residues in a synergistic manner. In addition to cellulolytic/hemicellulolytic activities, higher fungi such as basidiomycetes (e.g. Phanerochaete chrysosporium) have unique oxidative systems which together with ligninolytic enzymes are responsible for lignocellulose degradation. This review gives an overview of different fungal lignocellulolytic enzymatic systems including extracellular and cellulosome-associated in aerobic and anaerobic fungi, respectively. In addition, oxidative lignocellulose-degradation mechanisms of higher fungi are discussed. Moreover, this paper reviews the current status of the technology for bioconversion of biomass by fungi, with focus on mutagenesis, co-culturing and heterologous gene expression attempts to improve fungal lignocellulolytic activities to create robust fungal strains.Millions of years ago, atmospheric carbon was captured by plants in a process called photosynthesis, and over time was manifested into crude oil and coal. However, since the industrial revolution, we have used much of these energy sources, causing the excessive release of carbon back into the atmosphere. Thus, over the past 150 years atmospheric CO2 levels have increased from ~280 to ~380 ppm 1,2. In return, this is potentially causing warmer temperatures worldwide and leading to global climate changes 1,3,4.Rising energy consumption, depletion of fossil fuels and increased environmental concerns have shifted the focus of energy generation towards biofuel use. Global crude oil production is predicted to decline five times below its current level by 2050. Based on World Energy Council (WEC) calculations, the world-wide primary energy consumption is approximately 12 billion tonnes coal equivalent per year. United Nations calculations have shown that the world's population will increase to about 10 billion people by 2050 which will in turn increase energy demands to at least 24 billion tonnes coal equivalent per year (twice of what we consume today) depending on economic, social and political developments 5,6.Lignocellulose is a renewable organic material and is the major structural component of all plants. Lignocellulose consists of three major components: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. In addition, small amounts of other materials such as ash, proteins and pectin can be found in lignocellulosic residues, in different degrees based on the source 7. Cellulose, the major constituent of all plant material and the most abundant organic molecule on the Earth, is a linear biopolymer of anhydroglucopyranose-molecules, connected by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Coupling of adjacent cellulose chains by hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and Van der Waal's forces leads to a parallel alignment of crystalline structures known as microfibril 8. Hemicelluloses, the second most abundant component of lignocellulosic biomass, are heterogeneous polymers of pentoses (including xylose and arabinose), hexoses (mainly mannose, less glucose and galactose) and sugar acids. Composition of hemicelluloses is very variable in nature and depends on the plant source 9,10. Lignin, the third main heterogeneous polymer in lignocellulosic residues, generally contains three aromatic alcohols including coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl and p-coumaryl. Lignin acts as a barrier for any solutions or enzymes by linking to both hemicelluloses and cellulose and prevents penetration of lignocellulolytic enzymes to the interior lignocellulosic structure. Not surprisingly, lignin is the most recalcitrant component of lignocellulosic material to degrade 7,11.Lignocellulosic wastes are produced in large amounts by different industries including forestry, pulp and paper, agriculture, and food, in addition to different wastes from municipal solid waste (MSW), and animal wastes (Table ​(Table1)1) 12-17. These potentially valuable materials were treated as waste in many countries in the past, and still are today in some developing counties, which raises many environmental concerns 18,19. Significant efforts, many of which have been successful, have been made to convert these lignocellulosic residues to valuable products such as biofuels, chemicals and animal feed 20. Interestingly, in 2008 approximately 90% of the global ethanol fuel production (15,472.2 out of 17,335.2 Million of Gallons) was concentrated in two countries, Brazil (6,472.2), and The United States of America (9,000) 21. In Brazil, ethanol is usually produced from cane juice, whereas in the USA, starch-crops such as corn are usually used for ethanol production 7. Using sugars or corn as the main source for ethanol production caused a great deal of controversy due to its effect on food production and costs, which has made it difficult for ethanol to become cost competitive with fossil fuels. These concerns became a driving force in the generation of new biofuel research using lignocellulosic wastes produced by many different industries. The Iogen Corporation in Canada (http://www.iogen.ca/) is the world's leading operating plant for bioethanol production from lignocellulosic residues, and uses up to 30 tonnes per day of wheat, oat and barley straw to produce up to 0.52 million gallons of ethanol per year 22.Some of the lignocellulosic residues produced by different industries and potential for ethanol production1 Average values from 1997 to 2001 have been used to calculate world agricultural waste production 12. 2-4Potential contribution of MSW in USA, China and Canada in 2001, 1998 and 2002 respectively, assuming a conservative yield of 66 L of ethanol/MT of MSW 13-15. 5The fiber content (including cellulose and hemicellulose) of cattle manure, for example, is 52.6% (dry biomass basis). These sugars can be hydrolyzed and fermented to produce ethanol but the utilization of animal manures is more complicated due to its high protein content 16,17.In nature, degradation of cellulosic biomass is performed by mixtures of hydrolytic enzymes collectively known as cellulases. The cellulases include endo-acting (endoglucanases) and exo-acting (cellobiohydrolases) enzymes, which act in a synergistic manner in biomass-degrading microbes. Many microorganisms including fungi and bacteria had been found to degrade cellulose and other plant cell wall fibres. By 1976, over 14,000 fungal species capable of degrading cellulose had been isolated, but only a few of them were subjected to in-depth studies 23. Obviously, fungi contribute significantly to the decay of lignocellulosic residues in nature by producing many different lignocellulolytic enzymes. Most fungal strains produce various enzymes in large amounts which are released in the environment and act in a synergistic manner. The breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass involves the formation of long-chain polysaccharides, mainly cellulose and hemicellulose, and the subsequent hydrolysis of these polysaccharides into their component 5- and 6-carbon chain sugars. In biofuel production, these sugars can be converted to bioethanol through fermentation processes 24.The primary challenge in biomass conversion to bioethanol is achieving yields that make it cost-competitive with the current fossil-based fuels. Cellulose in the plant cell wall is not readily available to enzymatic hydrolysis (cellulases) due primarily to; (1) low accessibility of (micro-) crystalline cellulose fibers, which prevents cellulases from working efficiently, and (2) the presence of lignin (mainly) and hemicellulose on the surface of cellulose, which prevents cellulases from accessing the substrate efficiently 25. Thus, pretreatment of lignocellulosic residues before hydrolysis is a prerequisite and this can be performed by different methods (discussed in section 3.1.). High temperature and acid have been used initially for chemical cellulose degradation and they are still involved in pretreatment of lignocellulosic residues at industrial scales. However, this approach is expensive, slow and inefficient 26. In addition, the overall yield of the fermentation process will be decreased because this pretreatment releases inhibitors such as weak acids, furan and phenolic compounds 27. Some of these problems could be overcome by applying microorganisms such as fungi. For example, thermophilic fungal species such as Sporotrichum thermophile 28, Thermoascus aurantiacus 29 and Thielavia terrestris 30 have been proposed as good candidates for bioconversion of lignocellulosic residues to sugars and offer the great potential to be used at industrial scales. Applying thermophilic fungal species at industrial scales also allows energy savings because the costly cooling after steam pre-treatment is avoided and saccharification rates are improved. These fungi have been shown to produce cellulases and to degrade native cellulose; however, the enzyme activity in thermophilic organisms (e.g. S. thermophile) is usually low compared to mesophilic fungi such as T. reesei 28.The initial conversion of biomass into sugars is a key bottleneck in the process of biofuel production and new biotechnological solutions are needed to improve their efficiency, which would lower the overall cost of bioethanol production. Despite the fact that some fungal strains have the advantages of being thermostable and producing cellulases, most of these fungal strains do not produce sufficient amounts of one or more lignocellulolytic enzymes required for efficient bioconversion of lignocellulosic residues to fermentable sugars. Wild-type T. reesei and its best extracellular cellulase producer mutants (e.g. RUT-C30) for example, produce small amounts of β-glucosidase which inhibit further cellulose hydrolysis due to accumulation of the end product inhibitor (cellobiose). In addition, plant cell walls are naturally resistant to microbial and enzymatic (fungal and bacterial) deconstruction, collectively known as “biomass recalcitrance” 11. These rate-limiting steps in the bioconversion of lignocellulosic residues to ethanol remain one of the most significant hurdles to producing economically feasible cellulosic ethanol. Improving fungal hydrolytic activity and finding stable enzymes capable of tolerating extreme conditions has become a priority in many recent studies.This review focuses on lignocellulosic bioconversion by the application of different lignocellulolytic enzyme-producing fungi. In addition, this review addresses recent efforts to create robust fungal strains using mutagenesis, co-culturing and heterologous gene expression techniques and how these robust organisms can help overcome some of the critical issues in biofuel production.Lignocellulolytic enzymes-producing fungi are widespread, and include species from the ascomycetes (e.g. T. reesei), basidiomycetes including white-rot fungi (e.g. P. chrysosporium), brown-rot fungi (e.g. Fomitopsis palustris) and finally a few anaerobic species (e.g. Orpinomyces sp.) which degrade cellulose in gastrointestinal tracts of ruminant animals 31,32. Biomass degradation by these fungi is performed by complex mixtures of cellulases 33, hemicellulases 31 and ligninases 7,34, reflecting the complexity of the materials. Cellulases and most hemicellulases belong to a group of enzymes known as glycoside hydrolases (GH). Currently more than 2500 GH have been identified and classified into 115 families (for more information please visit the CAZy web page; www.cazy.org) 35. Interestingly, the same enzyme family may contain members from bacteria, fungi and plants with several different activities and substrate specifications. However, fungal cellulases (hydrolysis of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds) have been mostly found within a few GH families including 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 44, 45, 48, 61 and 74 35,36. Table ​Table22 summarizes a few different fungi producing different lignocellulolytic enzymes.Examples of different fungi producing different lignocellulolytic enzymes and their substrates.CMCase: Carboxymethylcellulases (endoglucanase), CBH: Cellobiohydrolases, BGL: β-glucosidases, CDH: Cellobiose dehydrogenase, MnP: Manganese peroxidises, LiP: Lignin peroxidises.Hydrolysis of the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in cellulose can be achieved by many different enzymes known as cellulases which use two different catalytic mechanisms, the retaining and the inverting mechanisms. All GH 12 cellulases, for example, hydrolyze glycosidic bonds by the retaining mechanism whereas family 6 cellulases use the inverting mechanism 33,36. In both mechanisms, two catalytic carboxylate residues are involved and catalyze the reaction by acid-base catalysis. Many different fungal species have the ability to degrade cellulose by producing extracellular fungal cellulose-degrading enzymes including endo-cleaving (endoglucanases) and exo-cleaving (cellobiohydrolases). Endoglucanases can hydrolyze glycosidic bonds internally in cellulose chains whereas cellobiohydrolases act preferentially on chain ends. The products of the enzymatic reaction are mostly a disaccharide known as cellobiose and, to a lesser extent, cello-oligosaccharides, which will be further hydrolyzed by the third group of enzymes called β-glucosidases 56. Cellulases mostly have a small independently folded carbohydrate binding module (CBM) which is connected to the catalytic domain by a flexible linker. The CBMs are responsible for binding the enzyme to the crystalline cellulose and thus enhance the enzyme activity 33. Currently many CBMs have been identified and classified into 54 families, however only 20 families (1, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 29, 32, 35, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 47, 48, 50 and 52) have been found in fungi. Different fungal cellulolytic enzymes and their main features are summarized in Table ​Table33.Overview of the three groups of fungal cellulolytic enzymes and their main features.1pH optima of BGLs vary based on the enzyme localization.Endoglucanases (EG) are also referred to as carboxymethylcellulases (CMCase), named after the artificial substrate used to measure the enzyme activity. EG initiate cellulose breakdown by attacking the amorphous regions of the cellulose, making it more accessible for cellobiohydrolases by providing new free chain ends. This has been shown by the effect of the enzyme on carboxymethylcellulose and amorphous cellulose 8. Fungal EGs are generally monomers with no or low glycosylation and have an open binding cleft. They mostly have pH optima between 4.0 and 5.0 and temperature optima from 50 to 70 °C (Table. ​(Table.3).3). Studies have shown that many fungi produce multiple EGs. For example, T. reesei produces at least 5 EGs (EGI/Cel7B, EGII/Cel5A, EGIII/Cel12A, EGIV/Cel61A and EGV/Cel45A) whereas three EGs were isolated from white-rot fungus P. chrysosporium (EG28, EG34 and EG44) 44,57. In addition, some EGs lack a CBM while some other EGs with CBM have been described. For example, four of five EGs in T. reesei including EGI, EGII, EGIV and EGV have CBM whereas EGIII does not have a CBM 36.Cellobiohydrolases (CBH) preferentially hydrolyze β-1,4-glycosidic bonds from chain ends, producing cellobiose as the main product. CBHs have been shown to create a substrate-binding tunnel with their extended loops which surround the cellulose 58,59. Similar to EGs, CBHs are monomers with no or low glycosylation with pH optima mostly between 4.0 and 5.0, but the temperature optima are wider, from 37 to 60 °C (Table. ​(Table.3).3). Studies have shown that some CBHs can act from the non-reducing ends and others from the reducing ends of the cellulosic chains, which increases the synergy between opposite-acting enzymes. For example, T. reesei has been shown to have two CBHs acting from non-reducing (CBHII/Cel6A) and reducing (CBHI/Cel7A) ends, which results in a more efficient cellulolytic degrader. Moreover, both CBHI and CBHII of T. reesei have CBM at the carboxy-terminus or at the amino-terminus of the catalytic module respectively. Cellobiose, the end product of CBHs, acts as a competitive inhibitor, which can limit the ability of the enzymes to degrade all of cellulose molecules in a system 36,44,60.β-glucosidases (BGL) have been isolated from many different fungal species including ascomycetes such as T. reesei, and basidiomycetes such as white-rot and brown-rot fungi. β-glucosidases hydrolyze soluble cellobiose and cellodextrins to glucose, and are thus competitively inhibited by glucose. BGLs have been placed in families 1 and 3 of glycoside hydrolases based on their amino acid sequences 64. Family 3 includes β-glucosidases from fungi, bacteria, and plants whereas family 1 includes β-glucosidases of bacterial, plant and mammalian origins which have galactosidase activity in addition to β-glucosidase activity. BGLs from both families hydrolyze β-1,4-glycosidic bonds using the retaining mechanism 65. BGLs show the most variability among the cellulolytic enzymes due to their structure and localization. While some BGLs have a simple monomeric structure with around 35 kDa molecular mass (e.g. from Pleurotus ostreatus) 61 some others have dimeric (e.g. from Sporobolomyces singularis with 146 kDa) 62 or even trimeric structures with over 450 kDa (e.g. from Pisolithus tinctorius) 63. In addition, most of BGLs are glycosylated and in some cases, such as the 300 kDa monomeric BGL from Trametes versicolor, the glycosylation degree is up to 90% 66. Regarding localization, BGLs can be grouped into three different types including intracellular, cell wall-associated and extracellular 67. Not surprisingly, pH optima for the enzymes vary based on enzyme localization, however, the temperature optima range from 45 to 75 °C (Table ​(Table3).3). In T. reesei, for example, two β-glucosidases (BGLI/Cel3A & BGLII/Cel1A) have been isolated from culture supernatant, but the enzymes were found to be primarily bound to the cell wall 68. Moreover, BGL production in T. reesei is very low compared to other cellulolytic fungi such as A. niger. Attempts with some success have been made to improve BGL activity in T. reesei by transformation of the bgl gene from the thermophilic fungus Talaromyces emersonii (cel3a) 69. More recently, the production of T. reesei β-glucosidase I was enhanced by homologous recombination using xylanase (xyn3) and cellulase (egl3) promoters which improved β-glucosidase activity to 4.0 and 7.5 fold compared to the parent, respectively 70.Several different enzymes are needed to hydrolyze hemicelluloses, due to their heterogeneity 10. Xylan is the most abundant component of hemicellulose contributing over 70% of its structure. Xylanases are able to hydrolyze β-1,4 linkages in xylan and produce oligomers which can be further hydrolyzed into xylose by β-xylosidase. Not surprisingly, additional enzymes such as β-mannanases, arabinofuranosidases or α-L-arabinanases are needed depending on the hemicellulose composition which can be mannan-based or arabinofuranosyl-containing 71. Similar to cellulases, hemicellulases are usually modular proteins and have other functional modules, such as CBM, in addition to their catalytic domains. Also similarly to cellulases, most of the hemicellulases are glycoside hydrolases (GHs), although some hemicellulases belong to carbohydrate esterases (CEs) which hydrolyze ester linkages of acetate or ferulic acid side groups 71,72. Hemicellulases belong to 20 different GH families (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 26, 27, 36, 39, 43, 51, 52, 53, 54, 57, 62 and 67) and all of them except for 4 (families 4, 8, 52 and 57) have been found in fungi. All but 1 (family 7) of the 7 different CE families (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) reported for hemicellulases have been found in fungi 35. Similarly to cellulases, aerobic fungi such as Trichoderma and Aspergillus secrete a wide variety of hemicellulases in high concentrations (8 and 12 hemicellulases, respectively) and these work in a synergistic manner 71.Lignin, the most abundant renewable aromatic polymer on the Earth, is composed of non-phenolic (80-90%) and phenolic structures 73. It has been shown that fungi degrade lignin by secreting enzymes collectively termed “ligninases”. These include two ligninolytic families; i) phenol oxidase (laccase) and ii) peroxidases [lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP)] 74. White-rot basidiomycetes such as Coriolus versicolor 73, P. chrysosporium and T. versicolor 75 have been found to be the most efficient lignin-degrading microorganisms studied. Interestingly, LiP is able to oxidize the non-phenolic part of lignin, but it was not detected in many lignin degrading fungi. In addition, it has been widely accepted that the oxidative ligninolytic enzymes are not able to penetrate the cell walls due to their size. Thus, it has been suggested that prior to the enzymatic attack, low-molecular weight diffusible reactive oxidative compounds have to initiate changes to the lignin structure (as discussed below) 76,77.A few decades ago, non-enzymatic degradation mechanisms for plant cell-wall polysaccharide degradation were also considered and over the time more evidence for these was found. The non-enzymatic degradation mechanism is mostly assisted by oxidation through production of free hydroxyl radicals (•OH). In fact, many white and brown-rot fungi have been shown to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which enters the Fenton reaction and results in release of •OH 78,79. These free radicals attack polysaccharides as well as lignin in plant cell walls in a nonspecific manner providing some cleavages which make it easier for the lignocellulolytic enzymes to penetrate 80,81. Three different pathways have been found for the generation of free radicals (discussed below) including cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) catalyzed reactions, low molecular weight peptides/quinone redox cycling and glycopeptide-catalyzed Fenton reactions (Table ​(Table4)4) 44.Different mechanisms involved in production of •OH in different fungiCDH, an extracellular monomeric protein with some glycosylation has been identified in a number of wood- and cellulose-degrading fungi including basidiomycetes (mostly white-rot fungi) and ascomycetes growing on cellulose. The enzyme is able to oxidize cellobiose, higher cellodextrins and other disaccharides or oligosaccharides with β-1,4 linkages. In addition, CDH with (in ascomycetes) or without CBM (in basidiomycetes) have been identified however even in the absence of CBM they are able to bind to cellulose through hydrophobic interactions 82. It has been shown in some fungi that under cellulolytic conditions CDH production increases which helps cellulases and hemicellulases 83,84. It is now widely accepted that CDH are able to degrade and modify all three major components of the lignocellulosic residues (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) by producing free hydroxyl radicals in a Fenton-type reaction (for detailed information please refers to the review by Baldrin and Valaskova, 2008 44).It has been shown that white and brown-rot fungi produce low molecular weight chelators which are able to penetrate into the cell wall. For example Gloeophyllum trabeum produces a low molecular weight peptide (known as short fiber generating factor, SFGF) which can degrade cellulose into short fibers by an oxidative reaction 81,85. It has also been reported that some of these low molecular weight compounds are quinones which have to be converted to hydroquinones by some fungal enzymes (Table ​(Table4)4) and then through Fenton reaction, free hydroxyl radicals will be produced 73.Different glycopeptides with different molecular weight (ranging from 1.5 to 12 kDa) have been found in many brown-rot fungi such as G. trabeum 86 and white-rot fungi such as P. chrysosporium 77,87. Similar to the other mechanisms, glycopeptides are able to catalyze redox reactions and thus produce free hydroxyl radicals.Anaerobic fungi represent a special group of microorganisms inhabiting the gastro-intestinal tract of ruminants and most non-ruminant herbivores. These fungi, along with some anaerobic bacteria (mainly from the class Clostridia e.g. Clostridium thermocellum 92), produce a range of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes in a multienzyme complex known as cellulosome. The first anaerobic gut fungi able to break down ingested lignocellulosic residues were identified in 1975 by Orpin 93 and since then 6 genera and 18 species have been identified some of which are shown in Table ​Table2.2. The cellulosome, however, was initially discovered in anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium thermocellum) in 1983 94, and then first described in anaerobic fungi in 1992 (Neocallimastix frontalis) 95. In anaerobic bacteria, the cellulosome is usually comprised of 20 or more different cellulolytic/hemicellulolytic enzymes. However, in anaerobic fungi such as N. frontalis and Piromyces, cellulosomes include at least six or ten polypeptides, respectively (cellulosome-type complex) 55,95,96. All hydrolytic enzymes in the cellulosome are bound together by noncatalytic scaffolding proteins. In addition to catalytic subunits, all enzymes have noncatalytic subunits known as “fungal dockerin domains” (FDD), which allow binding to cohesin modules of the scaffolding proteins. Interestingly, 50 fungal FDDs have been identified so far which present different amino acid sequences than those found in bacterial dockerins 31,97.Anaerobic fungi efficiently hydrolyze cellulose and hemicellulose by producing many lignocellulolytic enzymes. Most of the enzymes are associated with the cellulosome; however, some free enzymes also have been identified. In Piromyces sp. PC2, a cellulosome-producing anaerobic fungus for example, 17 lignocellulolytic enzyme encoding genes have been isolated including ten cellulases, one β-glucosidases, five hemicellulases and one enzyme facilitating protein folding. Interestingly, FDD has been reported only for 11 of the genes, which indicates that these cellulases are cellulosome-associated. Moreover, CBM has been identified only in three of those 17 genes, including two cellulases and one hemicellulase 31. Interestingly, the major products of cellulose digestion by fungal cellulosomes are glucose which eliminate the costly addition of β-glucosidase, whereas in the case of bacterial cellulosomes, cellobiose is the major product 98. Despite many advantages of cellulosomes such as synergistic activity between the components and efficient hydrolytic activity on both cellulose and hemicellulose, fungal cellulosomes are much less well characterized compared to bacterial cellulosomes.The bioconversion of lignocellulosic residues to valuable materials such as ethanol is more complicated than the bioconversion of starch based residues and thus requires four steps of processing, of which the first three are bio-related processes and the fourth is primarily a chemical engineering process that will not be discussed in great detail in this review; i) pretreatment ii) de-polymerization (saccharification) of cellulose and hemicelluloses to soluble monomer sugars (hexoses and pentoses) by a process known as hydrolysis, iii) conversion of these monomeric sugars to valuable products such as ethanol in a fermentation process and iv) separation and purification of the products (Figure ​(Figure1).1). In order to improve the yield, each step in the bioconversion process has to be optimized. In addition, process integration has to be considered in order to minimize process energy demand 22.Schematic picture for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol, including the major steps. Hydrolysis and fermentation can be performed separately (SHF, indicated by broken arrows) or as simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). In consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) however, all bioconversion steps are minimized to one step in a single reactor using one or more microorganisms. Different techniques such as mutagenesis, co-culturing and heterologous gene expression have been used to improve sugars utilization of the microbial biocatalyst as well as activity and/or stability of hydrolytic fungal-derived enzymes in order to improve the overall yields. For reduction of production cost, ethanol production can be integrated with a combined heat and power plant using lignin.Pretreatment of the lignocellulosic residues is necessary because hydrolysis of non-pretreated materials is slow, and results in low product yield. Some pretreatment methods increase the pore size and reduce the crystallinity of cellulose (Figure ​(Figure1).1). Pretreatment also makes cellulose more accessible to the cellulolytic enzymes, which in return reduces enzyme requirements and thus the cost 99. Many different pretreatment methods have been used, but they can be categorized into three broad groups: chemical (e.g. acid or alkali), physical/ physicochemical (e.g. physical ball milling or physicochemical steam explosion) and biological pretreatment by microorganisms 100. In the chemical pretreatment method using acid for example, hemicelluloses will be targeted whereas in alkali-catalyzed pretreatment mainly lignin is removed 22. It has been suggested that, there will probably not be a general pretreatment procedure and that different raw materials will require different pretreatments 22. Since many fungal cellulolytic enzymes (fungal-derived cellulases and β-glucosidases) work at lower pH (usually 4-5) acidic pretreatment seems a preferred option when fungal enzymes are chosen for the hydrolysis 22.Biological pretreatment uses microorganisms and their enzymes selectively for delignification of lignocellulosic residues and has the advantages of a low-energy demand, minimal waste production and a lack of environmental effects 101. White-rot basidiomycetes possess the capabilities to attack lignin. P. chrysosporium, for example, has been shown to non-selectively attack lignin and carbohydrate 102. P. chrysosporium was successfully used for biological pretreatment of cotton stalks by solid state cultivation (SSC) and results have shown that the fungus facilitates the conversion into ethanol 101. Other basidiomycetes such as Phlebia radiata, P. floridensis and Daedalea flavida, selectively degrade lignin in wheat straw and are good choices for delignification of lignocellulosic residues 103. Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, however, lacks cellulases (cellobiohydrolase activity) but produces manganese peroxide and laccase, and selectively delignifies several different wood species 104.After pretreatment, cellulose and hemicelluloses are hydrolyzed to soluble monomeric sugars (hexoses and pentoses) using cellulases and hemicellulases, respectively (Figure ​(Figure1).1). As mentioned earlier, many fungal species such as Trichoderma, Penicillium, Aspergillus and T. emersonii are able to produce large amounts of extracellular cellulases and hemicellulases. High temperature and low pH tolerant enzymes are preferred for the hydrolysis due to the fact that most current pretreatment strategies rely on acid and heat 105. In addition, thermostable enzymes have several advantages including higher specific activity and higher stability which improve the overall hydrolytic performance 106. Ultimately, improvement in catalytic efficiencies of enzymes will reduce the cost of hydrolysis by enabling lower enzyme dosages. Some fungal strains such as T. emersonii 107, T. aurantiacus 29, T. terrestris 30, S. thermophile 28, Chaetomium thermophilum 108 and Corynascus thermophilus 109 can produce thermostable enzymes which are stable and active at elevated temperatures (˃60°C) well above their optimum growth temperature (30 to ~55) 110. Due to the promising thermostability and acidic tolerance of thermophilic fungal enzymes, they have good potential to be used for hydrolysis of lignocellulosic residues at industrial scales.In the fermentation process, the hydrolytic products including monomeric hexoses (glucose, mannose and galactose) and pentoses (xylose and arabinose) will be fermented to valuable products such as ethanol (Figure ​(Figure1).1). Among these hydrolytic products, glucose is normally the most abundant, followed by xylose or mannose and other lower concentration sugars. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most frequently and traditionally used microorganism for fermenting ethanol from starch-based residues at industrial scales 22. S. cerevisiae has a few advantages such as its wide public acceptance, high fermentation rate and high ethanol tolerance that make it a good candidate for fermentation processes. However, S. cerevisiae is unable to efficiently utilize xylose as the sole carbon source or ferment it to ethanol 111. To make industrial lignocellulosic bioconversion more economically feasible, it is necessary to choose microorganisms capable of fermenting both glucose and xylose. Therefore, many successful attempts have been made to improve xylose fermentation in S. cerevisiae since the first discovery of pentose-fermenting yeasts in 1981 by a Canadian group 112. These efforts can be classified within two major groups: recombinant (e.g. metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae with genes from other xylose-fermenting yeasts) and non-recombinant (e.g. adaptation) techniques. These improvements have reached the point where the deficient xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae can now convert xylose to ethanol at an efficiency close to its theoretical value of 0.51 g g-1 (for extensive review please read Chu and Lee, 2007 111).In addition to xylose, S. cerevisiae is also unable to ferment arabinose, unless supplemented with rich media 113. Therefore, recombinant S. cerevisiae harbouring xylose-fermenting genes have been engineered with arabinose-metabolizing genes from other microorganisms. The latest recombinant S. cerevisiae (TMB 3400) has been shown to successfully ferment both xylose and arabinose in addition to glucose 114.During fermentation of lignocellulosic-based biomass, S. cerevisiae faces yet another challenge: the presence of inhibiting compounds including low molecular weight organic acids, furan derivatives, phenolics and inorganic compounds. These compounds are released and formed during pretreatment and/or hydrolysis of the lignocellulosic residues 115. Thus, it is necessary to detoxify hydrolytic products before the fermentation which increases process cost in addition to sugar loss 116. Interestingly, S. cerevisiae is one of the least sensitive microorganisms to the inhibitory effect of lignocellulolytic hydrolysate inhibitors. In a recent study for example, glucose and xylose, the hydrolytic products of steam-pretreated corn stover were efficiently co-fermented to ethanol without detoxification using the recombinant S. cerevisiae strain TMB 3400 117. It is also possible to adopt recombinant xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae to the hydrolysate inhibitors by continuous cultivation in the presence of the inhibitors 118.Attempts have been taken to reduce by-product inhibition. In a recent study for example, wheat straw pellets were subjected to wet explosion pretreatment using three different oxidizing agents, H2O2, O2 and air 119. Interestingly, the pretreatment with O2 has been shown to be the most efficient in enhancing conversion of the raw material to sugars. Using the method also has been minimized the production of furfural as a by-product which improved enzymatic hydrolysis and minimized the enzyme loading to 10 FPU/g with conversion rate of 70 and 68% for cellulose and hemicellulose respectively 119. Ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX) pretreatment also has been shown to be a good candidate since it does not produce some inhibitory by-products such as furans. However, the disadvantage of the method is that some of the phenolic compounds in lignin may remain on the pretreated material, which then needs to be washed. This creates wastewater, which causes the process to become environmentally unfriendly 100.The last two steps of bioconversion of pretreated lignocellulolytic residues to ethanol (hydrolysis and fermentation) can be performed separately (SHF) or simultaneously (SSF) (Figure ​(Figure1).1). In the separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), the hydrolysate products will be fermented to ethanol in a separate process. The advantage of this method is that both processes can be optimized individually (e.g. optimal temperature is 45-50 °C for hydrolysis, whereas it is 30 °C for fermentation). However, its main drawback is the accumulation of enzyme-inhibiting end-products (cellobiose and glucose) during the hydrolysis. This makes the process inefficient, and the costly addition of β-glucosidase is needed to overcome end-product inhibition 120. In simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), however, the end-products will be directly converted to ethanol by the microorganism. Therefore, addition of high amounts of β-glucosidase is not necessary and this reduces the ethanol production costs 121. However, the main drawback of SSF is the need to compromise processing conditions such that temperature and pH are suboptimal for each individual step. However, the development of recombinant yeast strains (i.e. improved thermotolerance) is expected to enhance the performance of SSF 1. Further process integration can be achieved by a process known as consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) which aims to minimize all bioconversion steps into one step in a single reactor using one or more microorganisms. CBP operation featuring cellulase production, cellulose/hemicellulose hydrolysis and fermentation of 5- and 6- carbon sugars in one step have shown the potential to provide the lowest cost for biological conversion of cellulosic biomass to fuels, when processes relying on hydrolysis by enzymes and/or microorganisms are used (Figure ​(Figure1)1) 122.In order to increase ethanol yield in the bioconversion process, both cellulose and hemicellulose have to be completely hydrolyzed with minimum sugar degradation. Moreover, all monomeric sugars produced during hydrolysis have to be efficiently fermented to ethanol. Technologies required for bioconversion of lignocelluloses to ethanol and other valuable products are currently available but need to be developed further in order to make biofuels cost competitive compared to other available energy resources such as fossil fuels. Many attempts have been made to improve the overall process yield and cost with a main focus on enzyme production and activity. Not surprisingly, the application of different strains and processes which are selected on the basis of the biomass residues used make comparisons difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, the most recent and important improvements in production/activity of fungal enzymes using different techniques such as mutagenesis, co-culturing and heterologous gene expression of cellulases are discussed below and summarized in Table ​Table55.Some methods which have been used to improve fungal lignocellulolytic activity or stability.SDM: site-directed mutagenesisMany fungal strains have been subjected to extensive mutagenesis studies due to their ability to secrete large amounts of cellulose-degrading enzymes. It has been four decades since Mandels and Weber (late 1960s) screened over 100 wild-type strains of Trichoderma species to isolate the best cellulolytic strain and came up with T. reesei (initially called T. viride QM6a) 123. Cellulolytic activity of T. reesei QM6a has been improved by using different mutagenesis techniques including UV-light and chemicals at the US Army Natick Laboratory, resulting in the mutant QM 9414 with higher filter paper activity (FPA) 124. Other studies in different laboratories have also made significant contributions to strain improvements using mutagenesis techniques, leading to development of the mutant strains M7, NG14 125 and RUT-C30 126. T. reesei RUT-C30 is one of the best known mutants, producing 4-5 times more cellulase than the wild-type strain (QM 6a). A recent study by Kovács and et al. (2008) has shown that wild-type Trichoderma atroviride (F-1505) produces the most cellulase among 150 wild-type Trichoderma. Moreover, T. atroviride mutants were created by mutagenesis using N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) as well as UV-light. These T. atroviride mutants (e.g. T. atroviride TUB F-1724) produce high levels of extracellular cellulases as well as β-glucosidase when they are grown on pretreated willow 127.Cellulase and xylanase activities in Penicillium verruculosum 28K mutants were improved about 3-fold using four cycles of UV mutagenesis. The enzyme production was further improved by 2- to 3-fold in a two-stage fermentation process using wheat bran, yeast extract medium and microcrystalline cellulose as the inducer 128. However, caution has to be taken during strain improvement by mutagenesis. Studies have shown that the best T. reesei mutant (RUT-C30) lacks an 85 Kb genomic fragment and is consequently missing 29 genes which include transcription factors, metabolic enzymes and transport proteins. In fact, these genotype changes are correlated with phenotypic changes such as poor growth on α-linked oligo- and polyglucosides or disturbance of osmotic homeostasis 129.On the other hand, site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) has played a central role in the characterization and improvement of cellulases including their putative catalytic and binding residues. Different site-directed mutagenesis methods such as saturation mutagenesis, error-prone PCR and DNA shuffling have been used to improve specific enzyme properties. For example, by the application of SDM it was found that Glu 116 and 200 are the catalytic nucleophile and acid-base residues in Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph T. reesei) Cel12A, respectively. In the study, mutant enzymes were produced where Glu was replaced by Asp or Gln at each position (E116D/Q and E200D/Q). The specific activity of these mutants was reduced by more than 98%, suggesting the critical role of these two residues in the catalytic function of the enzyme 130.In another study, the thermostable endo-1,4-β-xylanase (XynII) mutants from T. reesei were further mutated to resist inactivation at high pH by using SDM. All mutants were resistant to thermal inactivation at alkaline pH. For example, thermotolerance for one mutant (P9) at pH 9 was increased approximately 4-5 °C, resulting in better activity in sulphate pulp bleaching compared to the reference 131. Also, the catalytic efficiency and optimum pH of T. reesei endo-β-1,4-glucanase II were improved by saturation mutagenesis followed by random mutagenesis and two rounds of DNA shuffling. The pH optimum of the variant (Q139R/L218H/W276R/N342T) was shifted from 4.8 to 6.2, while the enzyme activity was improved more than 4.5-fold 132. Moreover, the stability of T. reesei endo-1,4-β-xylanases II (XynII) was increased by engineering a disulfide bridge at its N-terminal region. In fact, two amino acids (Thr-2 and Thr-28) in the enzyme were substituted by cysteine (T2C:T28C mutant) resulting in a 15 °C increase in thermostability 133.Fungal co-culturing offers a means to improve hydrolysis of lignocellulosic residues, and also enhances product utilization which minimizes the need for additional enzymes in the bioconversion process. In the case of cellulose degradation, for example, all three enzymatic components (EG, CBH and β-glucosidase) have to be present in large amounts. However, none of the fungal strains, including the best mutants, are able to produce high levels of the enzymes at the same time. T. reesei for example produces CBH and EG in high quantities whereas its β-glucosidase activity is low 134. A. niger however, produces large amounts of β-glucosidase, but has limited EG components 56. In addition, hemicellulose hydrolysis must also be considered when lignocellulosic residues are subjected to biomass conversion. However, this will be determined by the pretreatment methods. Specifically in an alkali pretreatment method, a part of lignin will be removed and thus hemicellulose has to be degraded by the use of hemicellulases, whereas in acid-catalyzed pretreatment, the hemicellulose layer will be hydrolyzed 22. Again, some fungal strains have been shown to work more efficiently on cellulosic residues whereas others produce more hemicellulolytic enzymes and efficiently hydrolyze hemicellulosic portions 20,135. Conversion of both cellulosic and hemicellulosic hydrolytic products in a single process can be achieved by co-culturing two or more compatible microorganisms with the ability to utilize the materials. In fact, in nature, lignocellulosic residues are degraded by multiple co-existing lignocellulolytic microorganisms. Co-culturing of two or more fungal strains in mixed culture fermentation is widely used in many biological processes including the production of antibiotics, enzymes and fermented food 136. Mixed fungal cultures have many advantages compared to their monocultures, including improving productivity, adaptability and substrate utilization. Improving fungal cellulolytic activity of T. reesei and A. niger by co-culturing was the subject of extensive research including studies done by Maheshwari 137, Ahmad 138 and Juhász 139. Moreover, other fungal strains have been co-cultured to obtain better cellulolytic activity such as co-culturing of T. reesei RUT-C30 and A. phoenicis 140 or A. ellipticus and A. fumigatus (Table ​(Table5)5) 141. There are a few examples of co-culturing fungal strains for the purpose of combining cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis such as co-culturing T. reesei D1-6 and A. wentii Pt 2804 in a mixed submerged culture 142 or co-culturing T. reesei LM-UC4 and A. phoenicis QM329 using ammonia-treated bagasse 143. In the both cases, enzyme activity for cellulases and hemicellulases was significantly increased. The main drawback of co-culturing however is the complexity of growing multiple microorganisms in the same culture 144.Alternatively to co-culture, microorganisms can be metabolically engineered, which enable one microorganism to complete an entire task from beginning to end. This can be done by altering metabolic flux by blocking undesirable pathway(s) and/or enhancement of desirable pathway(s). For example by application of homologous recombination, the production of T. reesei β-glucosidase I was enhanced using xylanase (xyn3) and cellulase (egl3) promoters which improved β-glucosidase activity to 4.0 and 7.5 fold compared to the parent, respectively. This will permit one fungal strain such as T. reesei to be more efficient on hydrolysis of cellulose to glucose which improve the yield and therefore lower the cost 70.Heterologous expression is a powerful technique to improve production yield of enzymes, as well as activity. In order to make a robust lignocellulolytic fungal strain, many different fungal cellulases with higher and/or specific activity based on the need for a functional cellulase system in the organism have been cloned and expressed. For example, thermostable β-glucosidase (cel3a) from thermophilic fungus T. emersonii was expressed in T. reesei RUT-C30 using a strong T. reesei cbh1 promoter. The expressed enzyme has been shown to be highly thermostable (optimum temperature at 71.5 °C) with high specific activity 69. In the study for the improvement of biofinishing of cotton, T. reesei cellobiohydrolase (I & II) were overexpressed using additional copy(s) of the genes cloned under T. reesei cbh1 promoter. The results have shown that the expression of CBHI was increased to 1.3- and 1.5-fold with one or two additional copies of the gene, respectively. In the case of CBHII, however, the expression was increased to 3- to 4-fold using just one additional copy of the gene 145. In addition, chimeric proteins with specific applications have been designed using recombinant DNA technology. For example, an endoglucanase from Acidothermus cellulolyticus was fused to T. reesei cellobiohydrolase and expressed in T. reesei. This bi-functional endo- & exo-acting cellulolytic enzyme has been shown to improve saccharification yields 146. Moreover, the structural and biochemical information obtained from family GH 12 homologues was used to create a wide range of H. jecorina Cel12 A variants which were heterologously expressed as secreted proteins in A. niger displaying temperature stability changes ranging from none to an increase of 3.9 °C (the most stable variant, P201C) (Table ​(Table5)5) 36.Lignocellulolytic microorganisms, especially fungi, have attracted a great deal of interest as biomass degraders for large-scale applications due to their ability to produce large amounts of extracellular lignocellulolytic enzymes. Many successful attempts have been made to improve fungal lignocellulolytic activity including recombinant and non-recombinant techniques. Process integration has also been considered for the purpose of decreasing the production cost, which was partly achieved by performing hydrolysis and fermentation in a single reactor (SSF) using one or more microorganisms (co-culturing). Moreover, recombinant S. cerevisiae with efficient fermenting activity for both 5- and 6-carbon sugars in the presence of inhibitors contributed to process integration. These laboratory improvements should now be verified in pilot and demonstration plants, such as the projects completed at the Iogen pilot plant (Canada). Scaling up the production of lignocellulosic ethanol, however, requires further reduction of the production cost. Overall, in order to improve the technology and reduce the production cost, two major issues have to be addressed: i) improving technologies to overcome the recalcitrance of cellulosic biomass conversion (pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation) and ii) sustainable production of biomass in very large amounts. In the case of large scale biomass production, in addition to forest and crop residues, energy crops such as switchgrass and Miscanthus can be grown to meet the needs. On the other hand, biotechnological approaches including systems biology and computational tools are likely good candidates to overcome these issues.We thank Miranda M.

PMC2757170,Complex Glycan Catabolism by the Human Gut Microbiota: The Bacteroidetes Sus-like Paradigm*,False,"Trillions of microbes inhabit the distal gut of adult humans. They have evolved to compete efficiently for nutrients, including a wide array of chemically diverse, complex glycans present in our diets, secreted by our intestinal mucosa, and displayed on the surfaces of other gut microbes. Here, we review how members of the Bacteroidetes, one of two dominant gut-associated bacterial phyla, process complex glycans using a series of similarly patterned, cell envelope-associated multiprotein systems. These systems provide insights into how gut, as well as terrestrial and aquatic, Bacteroidetes survive in highly competitive ecosystems.Our distal gut is home to one of the most densely populated microbial ecosystems on Earth. Dominated by members of the domain Bacteria, the gut microbiota harbors a collection of beneficial symbionts (mutualists) that perform myriad functions, including the provision of metabolic attributes not encoded in the human genome. One such attribute is the ability to ferment otherwise indigestible complex glycans to products such as short-chain fatty acids that we can absorb (1). This microbial process can provide up to 10% of daily caloric intake depending upon the diet (2).Viewed at the broadest taxonomic level, the distal gut microbiota of humans and other mammals is typically dominated by two of the ∼100 known bacterial phyla (divisions): Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes (3). During the past 2 years, several HMPs2 have been initiated throughout the world to better understand the assembly and composition of the microbiota in both healthy humans and those suffering from various pathophysiologic states such as obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases (4). These HMPs seek to determine the organismal diversity and gene content of the gut microbiota using culture-independent (metagenomic) approaches in conjunction with sequencing of several hundred cultured representatives of gut and non-gut communities. A central challenge to the sequencing efforts of HMPs is to go beyond descriptions of “who is there” or “what genes are present” in a community by continuing to probe the mechanisms by which microbes gain access to their habitats, operate as a community, and shape the biological properties of their hosts. In the distal gut, one important area is deciphering how community members have evolved to feed off the complex glycans that constantly inundate their habitat.Individual representatives of several bacterial phyla, including the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, are capable of metabolizing a variety of complex carbohydrates (5). Early phenotypic surveys revealed that the Gram-negative Bacteroidetes typically harbor very broad saccharolytic potential, with some species able to target dozens of different complex glycans (6). Members of the genus Bacteroides are prominently represented in the intestine: some are notably aerotolerant and therefore readily cultured outside of their native habitat. Combined with the development of tools for their genetic manipulation (7), they have become favored models for characterizing mechanisms of glycan metabolism by gut bacteria.A number of different plant-associated glycans are common components of our diets. These include plant cell storage glycans, such as starches and fructans, and plant cell wall glycans. Among cell wall glycans, cellulose is the most abundant, followed by two heterogeneous classes of polysaccharides: hemicelluloses and pectins. Hemicelluloses include xylan, galactoglucomannans, and xyloglucan (8). Pectin is composed of homogalacturonan and/or rhamnogalacturonan I backbones that can be decorated with additional side chains such as rhamnogalacturonan II, β-1,4- and β-1,3-galactans (each of which may contain α-arabinose branches), and α-arabinan (9). These dietary plant glycans, many of which cannot be digested in the proximal gut by the host, combine with mucin O-glycans, N-glycans, and glycosaminoglycans produced by the intestinal mucosa and the diverse repertoire of polysaccharide capsules and cell walls present on other gut microbes to form a biochemically rich nutrient foundation that sustains members of the distal gut microbiota.Seminal work by members of the laboratory of Abigail Salyers provided a template for understanding how Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent human gut Bacteroidete, is able to catabolize dietary glycans. Through their studies of starch degradation, they discovered a cell envelope-associated multiprotein system, which they named Sus (starch utilization system), that enables the bacterium to bind and degrade this carbohydrate. Subsequent microbial genome sequencing projects revealed that derivatives of this prototypic system (“Sus-like systems”) are highly represented in the genome of B. thetaiotaomicron and many other saccharolytic Bacteroidetes. A key feature of these Sus-like systems is the coordinated action of several gene products involved in substrate binding and degradation. Like other multicomponent strategies for glycan degradation (e.g. cellulosomes), this model highlights the fact that the concerted activities of multiple gene products can be more sophisticated and elaborate than their individual and isolated functions. Below, we review the current model of how the B. thetaiotaomicron Sus mediates starch utilization and then consider the breadth of different glycan substrates targeted by the many other Sus-like systems present in B. thetaiotaomicron and other related species from diverse habitats.The sus locus consists of eight adjacent genes, susRABCDEFG, that encode proteins composing the cell envelope-associated apparatus illustrated in Fig. 1. SusCDEFG localize to the outer membrane (10). SusC is a member of the TonB-dependent receptor family, a group of outer membrane-spanning β-barrel proteins that transport solutes and macromolecules via energy derived from the proton-motive force and the TonB-ExbBD complex (11, 12). SusDEFG are predicted lipoproteins that contain a bacterial signal peptidase II recognition motif. Following cleavage of their signal peptides, an N-acyl-S-diacylglyceryl moiety is covalently linked to their N-terminal cysteines (13). Immunohistochemical studies of intact and disrupted B. thetaiotaomicron cells suggest that all four Sus lipoproteins are exposed to the external environment, consistent with the notion that they are trafficked to and remain at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (10). The three remaining Sus products (SusRAB) contain signal peptidase I recognition motifs. SusA and SusB remain in the periplasm (10), whereas SusR contains a single internal transmembrane region that allows it to span the cytoplasmic membrane and extend domains into both the periplasm and cytoplasm (see below).Functional model of glycan processing based on the eight-gene B. thetaiotaomicron starch utilization system (Sus). Individual starch processing steps are illustrated and numbered sequentially. Step 1, glycans transit through the surface capsular polysaccharide layer. The upper left inset shows a quick-freeze, deep-etch scanning electron micrograph of the capsule, highlighting its remarkably reticulated features (photograph courtesy of Robyn Roth and John Heuser). Step 2, glycans are bound by outer membrane-associated components such as SusD, which makes direct contacts with starch based on the three-dimensional structure of its helices. The upper right inset shows SusD binding to β-cyclodextrin (Protein Data Bank code 3CK8), a cyclic oligosaccharide that mimics the three-dimensional structure of starch. The arc of aromatic residues binding β-cyclodextrin is highlighted in yellow sticks, with the close-up view on the right displaying dashed lines for important hydrogen-bonding interactions. A single Ca2+ ion bound by SusD is shown as an orange sphere. Step 3, surface-bound glycans are degraded by outer membrane-associated glycoside hydrolases like SusG, generating smaller oligosaccharides that are transported across the outer membrane by SusC-like proteins. Step 4, oligosaccharides are degraded into their component mono- or disaccharides by periplasmic glycan-degrading enzymes such as SusA and SusB. Steps 5 and 6, liberated saccharides serve as signals for transcriptional regulators that activate PUL gene expression. Step 7, depolymerized sugars are imported across the cytoplasmic membrane.Initial genetic experiments suggested that Sus function was required only for catabolism of starch-derived glycans containing four or more glucose units and was dispensable during growth on glucose, maltose, and maltotriose (14). A requisite step in starch utilization is binding of the glycan to the cell surface (15). Before this can occur, extracellular starch must transit a polysaccharide capsule that may be several hundred nanometers thick (Fig. 1, upper left inset). Intriguingly, B. thetaiotaomicron coordinates expression of some of its eight capsular polysaccharide synthesis loci via transcriptional regulators that also mediate expression of a subset of its Sus-like systems (16). Thus, B. thetaiotaomicron may alter the chemical composition of its surface capsule to facilitate utilization of extracellular glycans.Starch binding at the cell surface is accomplished through the concerted efforts of SusCDEF (10, 17). Recent biochemical and structural characterizations of SusD revealed that each SusD monomer has a single oligosaccharide-binding pocket that interacts with up to three individual glucose units in the target glycan (18). This pocket is composed of an arc of aromatic residues that conforms to the characteristic helical shape of amylose (Fig. 1, upper right inset) (19). Purified SusD binds to linear malto-oligosaccharides with relatively low affinity compared with cyclic oligosaccharides of the same length. For example, binding of linear maltoheptaose is almost 10-fold weaker than that of the cyclized form (18). In addition, the nature of the contacts between protein and ligand suggests that starch binding to SusD is driven by recognition of the backbone of the starch helices rather than by the stereochemistry of the individual glucose units. Thus, at least part of the substrate recognition mechanism of the Sus system depends on identifying the three-dimensional structure of the target substrate. This feature has also been observed for other carbohydrate-binding proteins that are not homologous to SusD, such as the carbohydrate-binding modules of numerous plant glycan-degrading glycoside hydrolases (19).Genetic experiments revealed that SusD is required not only for utilization of larger starch-derived molecules with more than six glucose units but also for optimal growth on maltotetraose and maltopentaose, for which SusD has little to no detectable affinity (18). This suggests that SusD plays additional roles beyond polysaccharide binding, such as channeling malto-oligosaccharides to other Sus proteins or maintaining the structural integrity of a Sus protein complex.Previous work in the Salyers laboratory indicated that both SusC and SusD are required for starch binding to the cell surface and interact with each other. Studies of isogenic mutants indicated that SusC and SusD alone contribute ∼60% of the starch binding affinity observed in wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron. Inclusion of SusE with SusC and SusD increases affinity for starch to >80% of the wild type. SusF contributes the remaining ∼20% (10). Recent experiments with purified SusE and SusF, which share ∼38% amino acid homology at their C termini, demonstrated that each interacts directly with starch and its oligosaccharides and that their affinity for starch-derived oligosaccharides is greater than that of SusD.3 Interestingly, experiments in which B. thetaiotaomicron was grown in vitro on highly purified and soluble forms of starch indicated that SusE and SusF are not essential for growth (20). These higher affinity starch-binding proteins may function to facilitate access to the more insoluble, granular forms of starch that reach the distal gut. Alternatively, they may sequester malto-oligosaccharides at the cell surface, rendering them less accessible to competing microbes.Surface-bound starch is hydrolyzed through the action of an outer membrane α-amylase, SusG. Expression of SusG alone does not support growth on starch but is essential for starch utilization (17). Because all Sus functions are dispensable on substrates shorter than maltotetraose, it is likely that SusG, an endo-acting enzyme, generates internal cuts in a bound starch molecule, releasing oligosaccharides larger than maltotriose, which are then transported by SusC into the periplasmic compartment (Fig. 1).In the periplasm, sequestered oligosaccharides are degraded into their component sugars prior to final transport to the cytosol. This is accomplished via two additional glycoside hydrolases, SusA and SusB, which possess neopullulanase and α-glucosidase activities, respectively (21, 22). Genetic disruption of either susA or susB alone does not eliminate growth on starch (21), suggesting that either enzyme is sufficient to depolymerize oligosaccharides, although it is possible that this function may be facilitated by other non-sus-associated enzymes (21). The atomic structure and enzymatic activity of SusB have been recently characterized (22). This enzyme prefers shorter substrates such as maltotriose, giving rise to the notion that SusA targets the larger oligosaccharides imported through SusC and that SusB works downstream from SusA (Fig. 1). Interestingly, SusB hydrolyzes substrates with different glucosidic linkages (α1,2, α1,3, α1,4, and α1,6). This “promiscuity” may increase the substrate spectrum for the Sus system, enabling use of substrates such as highly α1,6-branched pullulan.Transcriptional activation of seven sus genes (susABCDEFG) is accomplished via a sensor/regulator, SusR, in the presence of starch. The N terminus of SusR is presumed to extend into the periplasmic space, whereas its C terminus, containing a predicted helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif (23), remains in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). The smallest fragment of starch that induces sus expression is the disaccharide maltose (23). Some portion of SusR must receive this signal, either directly or indirectly: this recognition is most likely mediated by its periplasmic domain. Maltose sensing would therefore occur prior to complete hydrolysis of malto-oligosaccharides to glucose and may provide additional sensory information to B. thetaiotaomicron, namely monosaccharide content and linkage. Such a strategy could help economize the cell's resources by allowing a more specific enzymatic response toward the sensed substrate.The B. thetaiotaomicron genome contains 261 glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases currently annotated in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) Database (24). Remarkably, this organism's genome also contains 208 homologs of susC and susD, suggesting that the molecular strategy for starch utilization has been expanded to target other nutrients (25). There are 101 individual pairs of “susC-like” and “susD-like” genes, with the former always positioned immediately upstream of the latter (supplemental Fig. S1A). These susC/susD-like pairs are frequently components of larger gene clusters known as PULs that contain functions reminiscent of those in the prototypic sus, including glycan-degrading enzymes and regulators (26–28). Individual genes within sus-like PULs commonly share little or no homology with the prototypic sus locus beyond that of susC and susD. B. thetaiotaomicron contains 88 of these PULs, encompassing 866 genes and composing 18% of its genome (28). Although the minimum feature used to define each Sus-like PUL is a single pair of susC/susD homologs, 61% of these gene clusters in B. thetaiotaomicron resemble the prototypic sus locus in that they encode both glycan-degrading enzymes and a regulator.Most sus-like PULs in B. thetaiotaomicron do not have regulators related to SusR but instead possess either hybrid two-component system phosphorelays or ECF-σ factor/anti-σ factor pairs. Like SusR, these regulators activate PUL transcription in response to glycans but do so through different mechanisms (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B) (28). A notable similarity that hybrid two-component system and ECF-σ/anti-σ regulators share with SusR is that each extends across the cytoplasmic membrane and equips the cell to sense both the sugar content and glycosidic linkages of glycan-derived saccharides before they are completely depolymerized (16, 29). This sensing may be through direct interactions with the saccharide or may be indirect and dependent on substrate recognition by other proteins. An example of regulation by indirect interaction of a transcription factor with saccharides is the activation of several dozen different B. thetaiotaomicron PULs by ECF-σ/anti-σ factor pairs through a mechanism termed trans-envelope signaling (16, 30). In this regulatory scheme, an inner membrane-spanning anti-σ factor interacts with a specialized SusC-like receptor in the outer membrane to relay the presence of extracellular glycans to a cytoplasmic ECF-σ transcription factor. The resulting protein bridge spans both cell membranes and likely facilitates a rapid transcriptional response when the appropriate glycan is present within the SusC-like receptor (see supplemental Fig. S1B and legend for further details) (16).The physiological response to glycans sensed by PUL-associated regulators is contained in the adjacent PUL genes, which encode the enzymes required to degrade the sensed substrate. The predicted activities of the glycan-degrading enzymes contained in B. thetaiotaomicron vary widely among PULs, supporting the idea that different PULs have evolved to engage glycans besides starch. Indeed, whole-genome transcriptional profiles of B. thetaiotaomicron grown in vitro on purified glycans and in the distal gut of gnotobiotic mice consuming different diets (supplemental Fig. S1C) have revealed aspects of the “code” that links individual substrates to the activation of specific Sus-like PULs (27, 28, 31). For example, B. thetaiotaomicron deploys Sus-like PULs to target various plant-derived glycans, especially polygalacturonate, rhamnogalacturonan I, β-galactans, and α-arabinan contained in pectin.4 When dietary plant glycans are not available, host glycans (mucin O-glycans, N-glycans, and glycosaminoglycans) can serve as alternative nutrient sources (27, 28). In addition to harboring enzymes involved in breaking glycosidic linkages, some PULs also encode enzymes for removal of glycan modifications (e.g. the sulfatase and acetyl esterase depicted in supplemental Fig. S1A), which is likely a prerequisite step in degrading the underlying backbone.The Bacteroidetes are a diverse and broadly distributed phylum and include members represented in both mammalian and insect (e.g. termite) gut, soil, and both fresh and salt water ecosystems (3, 32–34). They can be free-living or symbiotic and include endosymbionts (35, 36). Like their relatives in animal guts, a common feature associated with environmental Bacteroidetes is their ability to degrade complex glycans.Several dozen complete or deep-draft genome sequences are now available for Bacteroidetes isolated from the animal gut or the environment. Most of these genomes encode sus-like PULs (28). The only exception noted to date is Candidatus Sulcia muelleri, an endosymbiont of hemipteran insects with a remarkably reduced genome size (∼250 kilobase pairs), reflecting its specialized intracellular habitat (35). The apparent diversity of Bacteroidetes Sus-like systems across this cosmopolitan phylum suggests that they have been adapted to degrade numerous substrates in diverse environments. Consistent with this idea, many Bacteroidetes species that harbor these systems metabolize additional substrates inaccessible to B. thetaiotaomicron: cellulose, hemicellulose, chitin, agarose, and alginate (6, 33, 34, 36).Substrate diversity among Sus-like systems can be observed in both close and distant relatives of B. thetaiotaomicron. For example, unlike B. thetaiotaomicron, the human gut symbiont Bacteroides ovatus grows on all known plant hemicelluloses (6). This trait is likely due to the presence of additional PULs that target hemicelluloses: at least two of these target xylan and galactomannan (supplemental Fig. S1A) (37, 38). The SusD-like proteins encoded in these PULs, as well as lipoproteins of unknown function encoded by genes located downstream of these susD-like homologs (i.e.“susE-positioned” genes) (supplemental Fig. S1A), bind directly to their hemicellulose substrates.3 Interestingly, the lipoproteins encoded by these susE-positioned genes bear no homology to SusE and SusF yet appear to play a similar functional role in glycan binding. Proteins with similar signal peptidase II motifs are encoded in most PULs and are usually positioned downstream of the susD homologs (supplemental Fig. S1A), suggesting that they play important roles in the functions of Sus-like systems.Additional evidence for expanded substrate diversity can also be observed outside of the Bacteroides genus. For example, the environmental Bacteroidete Flavobacterium johnsoniae contains multiple homologs of susC and susD, and these are also components of PULs. A notable feature of this organism is its ability to degrade the insoluble glycan chitin (39). Consistent with this phenotype, the F. johnsoniae genome harbors a PUL encoding three predicted chitinases (supplemental Fig. S1A). If this locus is shown to be responsible for chitin utilization, it would represent the first Sus-like system that targets a highly insoluble polysaccharide.Each Bacteroidetes Sus-like system is a group of cell envelope-associated proteins that degrade a particular glycan. Like other microbial assemblies involved in nutrient degradation and uptake (e.g. cellulosomes), Sus-like systems highlight two key concepts: (i) multiple proteins work together during catalysis, and (ii) the genes encoding these concerted functions are often genomically linked into discrete clusters. The thousands of different sus-like PULs present in sequenced Bacteroidetes compose an amazingly diverse group of genes involved in regulating and directing glycan catabolism. Many of the genes in these clusters share little or no homology with genes contained in other PULs, and a substantial proportion (e.g. ∼39% of the 866 PUL genes in B. thetaiotaomicron) are not homologous to any genes of known function. Moreover, the breadth of substrates targeted by different PUL-containing Bacteroidetes suggests that the Sus-like paradigm has evolved to include a very broad suite of substrates, including those important to biofuel production, such as cellulose and hemicellulose. Pairing individual PULs with distinct glycan substrates will be a first step in defining the functions of these unknown genes and will likely lead to discovery of new proteins involved in glycan metabolism. Deciphering how these systems function promises to provide important insights into the dynamic operations of our gut microbiota and the foundations of our nutritional health. The lessons learned should also be applicable to other ecosystems that sustain our planet.We thank Laura Kyro for help with graphics.*This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grants DK30292, GM078800, HD07409, and AI073060.

While green algae and land-plants store starch in plastids by using an ADP-glucose-based pathway related to that of cyanobacteria, red algae, glaucophytes, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, and apicomplexa parasites store a similar type of polysaccharide named floridean starch in their cytosol or periplast. These organisms are suspected to store their floridean starch from UDP-glucose in a fashion similar to heterotrophic eukaryotes. However, experimental proof of this suspicion has never been produced. Dinoflagellates define an important group of both photoautotrophic and heterotrophic protists. We now report the selection and characterization of a low starch mutant of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate Crypthecodinium cohnii. We show that the sta1-1 mutation of C. cohnii leads to a modification of the UDP-glucose-specific soluble starch synthase activity that correlates with a decrease in starch content and an alteration of amylopectin structure. These experimental results validate the UDP-glucose-based pathway proposed for floridean starch synthesis.Glycogen defines the most widespread form of storage polysaccharides found in archea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. It consists of α-1,4-linked glucan chains hooked together by α-1,6 branches that are distributed symmetrically within small-size hydrosoluble particles. Starch has the same basic composition but contains an heterogeneous mixture of amylopectin and amylose that aggregate into insoluble and semicrystalline granules of unlimited size. Amylopectin, the major fraction of starch, displays a distribution of α-1,6 branches distinctively asymmetrical, thereby allowing this aggregation. By contrast, amylose, which displays very low branching, is dispensable for starch granule formation. While glycogen is widely distributed in eukaryotes, starch is restricted to Archaeplastida (lineages descending from primary endosymbiosis of the plastid) and some secondary endosymbiosis derivatives of the latter. Plastidial starch is found in chloroplasts or amyloplasts of green algae and land plants (the Chloroplastida), while cytosolic starch is found in the cytoplasm of the red algae and glaucophytes (Rhodophyceae and Glaucophyta) and in the cytoplasm or periplast of their secondary endosymbiosis derivatives. The name “floridean starch” has been coined to describe this cytosolic accumulation of storage starch that was described in a particular group of red algae: the Florideophycideae (1).We have recently proposed that in the common ancestor of the Archaeplastida, starch synthesis occurred in the cytosol. Cytosolic starch metabolism resulted from the merging of the storage polysaccharide pathways of the cyanobacteria-like endosymbiont and of its eukaryotic host, the former using ADP-glucose and the latter UDP-glucose as glucosyl-unit donors (2). Some of the cyanobacterial genes involved in polysaccharide metabolism were transferred to the nucleus and expressed in the cytosol. Both ADP-glucose and UDP-glucose substrates were used in the cytosol for starch synthesis, which thus relied on a mixture of enzymes of cyanobacterial and eukaryotic phylogenies (2). The maintenance of this dual substrate pathway was selected because it allowed for the export of ADP-glucose that was produced in the cyanobiont and its polymerization in the cytosol, thereby achieving the export of photosynthate and establishing the endosymbiotic link (2).When the three Archaeplastida lineages emerged from this common ancestor, starch was maintained in the cytosol in the glaucophytes and red algae, while it was redirected to plastids that had remained the site of ADP-glucose synthesis in the green algae (the Chloroplastida) (3, 4). The enzymes that were used for elongation of starch in the Chlororoplastida thus relied on those that originally came with the endosymbiont, as these were better adapted to the use of ADP-glucose. On the other hand, we proposed that the glaucophytes and red algae synthesized floridean starch in the cytosol by enzymes of host origin that favored UDP-glucose.If this proposal is correct, then there should be organisms that produce starch in the cytosol from UDP-glucose using a host-derived glucan synthase. To date there is circumstantial evidence that this is true because an enzyme activity that uses UDP-glucose has been detected (5–9). However, there is no direct correlation between the function of this enzyme and the production of starch. In addition, other reports are suggestive of the presence of an ADP-glucose-based pathway in floridean starch accumulators (1, 10, 11).This paper provides the missing direct correlation by showing genetic linkage of loss of starch and modification of a UDP-glucose-dependent glucan synthase activity in the model floridean starch accumulator Crypthecodinium cohnii.Colonies (50,213) that survived UV mutagenesis (at 20% survival) were screened through our iodine staining procedure. A total of 97 mutants were selected, and 32 had a confirmed defect in starch accumulation (Fig. S1). The vast majority of these confirmed mutants (29 out of 32) displayed a yellow phenotype easy to distinguish from the dark blue-black stain of the wild-type. This yellow phenotype correlates with a minimum of 80% decrease in polysaccharide amounts. The three remaining mutants displayed either a red color (strains PP107 and PP406), when sprayed with iodine, or a greenish taint (PP45), suggestive of specific defects, respectively, in amylose and amylopectin synthesis. They accumulated intermediate polysaccharide amounts (between 20 and 90% of wild-type amounts) and will be described elsewhere.The predominant “yellow” class of mutants was subjected to preliminary biochemical characterization. This consisted in zymogram assays of enzymes of starch metabolism. Four types of activity gels were used (8); these consisted of glycogen-containing polyacrylamide gels incubated with glycosyl-nucleotides (either ADPG or UDPG) or with glucose-1-P to monitor starch synthase and starch phosphorylase, respectively. In addition, starch hydrolases (amylases, glucosidases) and other type of glucan transferases (branching and debranching enzymes, α-1,4 glucanotransferases) can be evidenced in amylopectin or starch containing polyacrylamide gels incubated in buffer without hexose-P or glycosyl nucleotides. In these conditions, the color displayed by the iodine-stained bands will be suggestive of the type of activity revealed (pink for branching enzyme, white for branching enzyme, amylase or glucosidase, blue for debranching enzymes, dark red for α-1,4 glucanotransferases). Only one strain (PP314) repeatedly displayed a strong modification of zymogram pattern. The latter consisted in the replacement of the two fastest migrating bands evidenced in the wild-type reference by a single slower band (Fig. 1A) on glycogen-containing gels incubated with UDP-glucose. This observation was accompanied in crude extracts by a 40% reduction in total assayable UDP-glucose-specific soluble starch synthase activity. We checked all other assayable activities and saw no consistent modifications in other enzyme activities suspected to be involved in starch metabolism (Table S1 and Fig. S2). We therefore embarked on a more detailed genetic and biochemical characterization of the soluble starch synthase defect of strain PP314.Starch deposition is impaired in the PP314 mutant strain. (A) Glycogen-containing zymogram gel incubated with UDP-glucose and stained with iodine. The brown bands correspond to the starch synthase activities detected in the wild-type reference strain (Left) and the PP314 (RXA40) mutant strain (Right). (B) Growth curves and polysaccharide accumulation of wild-type and PP314 mutant strains in liquid rich medium. Growth is displayed as closed black and open white circles, respectively, for the wild-type and mutant strains. The amounts of starch synthesized by C. cohnii wild-type (solid diamonds) and PP314 mutant (open diamonds) strain are displayed and expressed as milligrams of starch per milliliter of culture.Most yeasts and bacteria accumulate glycogen while approaching stationary phase. Unlike most microorganisms, C. cohnii accumulates storage polysaccharides during early log phase in 1.5% glucose-containing medium, which we have proposed (5) to reflect adaptation of dinoflagellates to a phagotrophic way of life in an otherwise oligotrophic environment (the ocean). They are indeed expected to face sudden burst of nutrients as they ingest prey and are required to rapidly store the bulk of the surplus energy. Inoculation of heterotrophic dinoflagellates in high glucose medium may mimic such bursts. Growth curves and starch accumulation patterns are displayed in Fig. 1B. A 90% decrease in starch amounts relative to the wild-type was scored in liquid-rich medium during log phase. While the wild-type cultures displayed a sharp decrease in starch content as it entered stationary phase, the mutant did not show a comparable decrease and reached a similar very low starch content at the end of stationary phase.Starch was purified from late log phase wild-type and mutant PP314 cells. The granules were dispersed, and the constituent polysaccharides were separated through gel permeation chromatography. Amylopectin, the high mass component of starch is typically excluded from such columns, while the smaller amylose fraction is clearly separated from the latter and displays a heterodisperse size distribution. The mutant starch was selectively enriched in amylose, which defined 50% of the total starch, while the wild-type accumulated up to 30% of this fraction (Fig. S3). However, on a cell basis, the total amylose content was not modified, taking into account the reduction in starch amounts of the mutant. However, the reverse applies to amylopectin, whose reduction is exacerbated on a total cell basis (70–80% reduction). The color of the iodine polysaccharide interaction is known to depend on the lengths of the glucan chains. The maximal wavelength of the iodine polysaccharide of amylose (λmax) was not significantly modified. However, we did record a significant 10-nm increase in the λmax of amylopectin. We confirmed this modification in amylopectin structure by examining the chain-length (CL) distribution of the wild-type and mutant starch by capillary electrophoresis (CE) of enzymatically debranched chains (Fig. 2). In this technique, the branches are selectively hydrolyzed by an isoamylase. The debranched chains are labeled by fluorescence at the reducing end, thereby yielding the same amount of fluorescence irrespective of their size. The chains are separated by CE, achieving a clear separation for each type of chain differing by as little as one glucose residue up to a degree of polymerization of 70. The CL distribution is thus yielded by detection and quantification of the fluorescence. With this analysis, a decrease in chains ranging between 14 and 30 glucose residues in length was recorded and accompanied by a relative increase in chains ranging between 5 and 13 glucose residues. This modification in amylopectin CL distribution was not restricted to the outer chains of the polysaccharide. Indeed we selectively hydrolyzed such chains through the use of β-amylase and subjected the residual polysaccharide to the same enzymatic debranching and CE analysis of the debranched chains. β-Amylase selectively digests chains from their reducing ends and stops two to three residues from the α-1,6 branch, leaving the core structure with very short external branches. Results displayed in Fig. 2 C and D show that the inner core structure of the polysaccharide was also modified. To assess the consequences of this modification of starch structure on the crystalline packing of the glucan chains, we examined the wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) pattern of the mutant and compared it to the wild-type. Starches come into two distinct WAXD patterns that correspond to two different elemental packing structures of double helical glucans. A-type diffraction patterns are found in cereal endosperm, plant leaf, and green algae starches. B-type patterns are typical of tuber starches and of starches of high amylose mutants of cereals and algae. While wild-type C. cohnii displayed a pure A-type WAXD pattern (5), the PP314 mutant displayed a mixture of A and B patterns often defined mistakenly as a third C-type diffraction pattern (Fig. S4). Finally we examined starch granule shapes and sizes by scanning electron microscopy on purified granules (Fig. 3). The mutant granule size distribution was more heterodisperse than that of the wild-type. In addition, while wild-type granules appeared ellipsoidal and smooth (Fig. 3A), the mutant starch granule morphology was distinctively altered with a large number of angular, elongated, and sometimes fused granules (Fig. 3B). These alterations are reminiscent of those seen in Chlamydomonas-soluble starch synthase mutants (12, 13).Comparison of the CL distribution profiles for wild-type and mutant amylopectins. After purification on a gel filtration Sepharose CL-2B column, amylopectin was debranched with isoamylase and pullulanase. The resulting glucans were analyzed by CE. The relative proportions for each glucan in the total population are expressed as a percentage of the total number of chains. A and C are, respectively, corresponding to the CL distribution obtained from wild-type amylopectin without and with β-amylase pretreatment. B and D are to the corresponding mutant amylopectin samples. The unbroken lines on B and D correspond to the difference plots obtained by subtracting the mutant CLD to the wild-type CLD.Scanning electron microscopy of native purified starch granules from the wild-type (A) and PP314 mutant (B) strains.In summary, PP314 displayed a strong reduction in amylopectin content with a significantly modified structure. We can reasonably speculate that the altered starch synthase activity was mostly responsible for the synthesis of the missing amylopectin chains.To ensure that the defects in starch structure, polysaccharide amounts, and soluble starch synthase activity resulted from mutation of the same single gene, we embarked in cosegregation analysis of the latter with the genetic defect present in strain PP314. C. cohnii displays a homothallic haplontic life cycle, where the selection and analysis of stable diploid clones is not technically feasible. However, we have recently revisited techniques allowing for gametogenesis, fertilization, and production of meiotic recombinants. In a first step of our analysis, we introduced the canr1-1 marker mutation conveying resistance to 200 μg/mL canavanine by mixing gametes of PP314 with the CAN1 strain. We obtained 3% of our canavanine-resistant clones that simultaneously failed to stain with iodine and therefore appeared yellow, while no such clones were obtained on a total of >1,000 colonies tested when CAN1 was mixed with the ALB strain. This strain displays an albino phenotype, but is otherwise wild-type for starch accumulation. The low starch canavanine-resistant recombinant strain RB1 was then mixed with the ALB strain, and the albino canavanine-resistant recombinant population was analyzed. This enabled us to analyze segregation of the starch accumulation defect in a pure recombinant sample population without contamination by unfused parents. A total of 80 such colonies were stored and subjected to phenotypic characterization. Two discontinuous classes of phenotypes were recorded: 42 Cell patches corresponding to strains accumulating between 80 and 120% of our standard wild-type reference stained black with iodine while 38 strains accumulating from 10–30% of the wild-type amounts stained yellow with iodine. Thirty recombinants were subjected to zymogram analysis (Fig. 4). Among these 30 strains, all low starch recombinants displayed the modified starch synthase zymogram pattern of PP314, while all wild-type recombinants displayed that of our wild-type reference C. cohnii strain. To monitor cosegregation of the starch synthase defect with the alteration in amylopectin structure, we subjected a random sample of the starches purified from three mutant and three wild-type recombinants to the same detailed structural characterization reported above. All three mutants displayed a high amylose content and the same modification in amylopectin CL distribution. These modifications were identical to those evidenced in strain PP314. Taken together, these results prove that PP314 carries a mutation (sta1-1) that behaves as a single Mendelian defect upon crossing. The sta1-1 mutation is responsible for a decrease and modification in UDP-glucose-specific soluble starch synthase activity, which in turn results in a specific decrease in amylopectin synthesis. This decrease is accompanied by significant modification of the structure of both external chains and the internal core of the polysaccharide structure, which in turn is responsible for a modification of the crystalline organization and of the shape and size distribution of the polysaccharide granules.Segregation analysis in the recombinant progeny obtained from the cross between RB1 and ALB1. The colonies of C. cohnii were grown on rich-medium plates and stained with iodine (Upper). The strains displaying a yellow phenotype display a strong (80%) reduction in starch amount. The Lower displays the starch synthases activities detected on glycogen-containing zymograms. The cosegregation between the low-starch yellow phenotype and the modification in starch synthase activities is displayed for 12 recombinant strains harboring both the albinos and the canavanine resistance phenotypes. The two first samples on the Left correspond to the wild-type and the original PP314 mutant strains, respectively.To further confirm that the mutant strain contained modified soluble starch synthase activities, we tried to separate the three major activities visualized in crude extract zymograms following the procedure established previously for wild-type strains (5).The first step took advantage of the difference in affinities for α-glucans observed for each starch synthase isoform on zymograms, with the slowly migrating form having more affinity. It consisted of affinity chromatography on an amylose column. In the wild-type, the slowly migrating starch synthase was retained on this resin, while the fast-migrating form was found back in the low-affinity fraction of the protein mixture allowing further characterizations of the two semipurified fractions (5). The same procedure using a mutant strain crude extract revealed once again a modification of the starch synthase activities in PP314. We were able to detect two different starch synthase activities retained on the amylose column, the slowly migrating form as it was assessed in a wild-type but also a faster migrating isoform (Fig. S5), which however migrated slower than the two wild-type low affinity isoforms. However, a part of this faster-migrating isoform was still found in the unretained fraction, a majority of this activity was coeluting with the slowly migrating isoform. Several chromatographic procedures were tried to separate the two major starch synthase activities (the high and low affinity activities) in the mutant background (anion exchange HiTrapQ column, Gel permeation S300 column), but we always observed coelution of both activities. These results are consistent both with either the selective loss of a particular enzyme or enzyme subunit in PP314 or with the posttranslational modification of starch synthase activities.That heterotrophic eukaryotes polymerize glycogen from UDP-glucose was proved beyond doubt by mutant selection and biochemical analysis in yeasts, fungi, and animals. Similarly, the isolation of starchless or glycogenless mutants of plants, green algae, and bacteria prove that the latter use ADP-glucose only to polymerize their storage polysaccharides. However, the status of floridean starch synthesis was unclear, and experimental reports supporting either an ADP-glucose- or an UDP-glucose-based pathway have appeared (1). To bring functional evidence with respect to this and other issues concerning floridean starch synthesis, we engaged in the selection of mutants defective for the synthesis of such polymers. In our opinion, the only organism among floridean starch accumulators that seemed amenable to such a functional approach consisted of the unicellular heterotrophic dinoflagellate C. cohnii (5). Indeed, >30 years ago, two research groups published the selection of a number of adenine, guanine, or cytosine auxotrophs and of mutants defective for either cell motility or carotenoid biosynthesis in this species (14–17). None of these mutants were sufficiently characterized to uncover a specific biochemical defect, but they were instrumental in setting up conditions for gametogenesis, crossing, and recombinant selection in this model homothallic dinoflagellate species. Nevertheless, these pioneering studies were not pursued, and the original mutants were lost. Moreover in our hands, the different gametogenesis techniques detailed by these two groups failed to trigger the sexual cycle of our reference strain. We have recently reinvestigated this issue and set out to select for mutants defective for floridean starch metabolism in C. cohnii (5). We now describe a low starch mutant of this dinoflagellate species that displays reduced and altered UDP-glucose-specific soluble starch synthase activity. This establishes an UDP-glucose-based pathway for floridean starch synthesis and describes a dinoflagellate mutant with an identified biochemical defect. The existence of such a pathway is consistent with the idea that in the ancestor of the Archaeplastida, both ADP-glucose and UDP-glucose pathways were indeed operating to generate cytosolic starch. This dual pathway was essential in establishing the connection between the eukaryotic host and its endosymbiont. Bioinformatic mining of genomic resources identifies candidate genes for enzymes of glucan elongation in some floridean starch accumulators. These genes are related to sequences found in many diverse nonphotosynthetic eukaryotes where they are thought to be used for glycogen metabolism. According to the CAZy classification (18), the candidate genes encode a GT5-type of glycosyl transferase, which is quite distinct from the intensively studied GT3-type of glycogen synthase known to polymerize glycogen from UDP-glucose in animals and fungi. Both the function of the putative eukaryotic GT5 glycogen synthases and their substrate preferences remain to be ascertained.The primitive status of genomics and the typical very large size dinoflagellate genome of C. cohnii prevented us from identifying candidate soluble starch synthase genes. Despite the finding of GBSSI-like sequences, we were unable in addition to locate GT5 or GT3 soluble starch synthase-like sequences in Crypthecodinium or other dinoflagellate EST resources. Anyhow, it is quite possible that STA1 does not code the altered starch synthase activity. Indeed in yeast, low glycogen mutants were selected through an analogous mutant screen by forward genetics. The vast majority of mutants selected encoded components of the cell signal transduction machinery that included protein kinases and phosphatases and not the structural genes of enzymes of the glycogen pathway (19). Comparable elements had been known for years to regulate mammalian glycogen metabolism. The altered mobility and kinetics of the modified starch synthase could be interpreted along similar lines.The algal C. cohnii strain ATCC40750 was grown and maintained in the dark at 27 °C in liquid and solid rich medium, respectively (5). The UV mutagenesis was performed using a Transilluminator UV LightBox (UV Products) at 302 nm. Colonies were selected through spraying with iodine vapors as detailed in ref. 5. The resulting iodine staining depends on both the amount and composition of the storage glucans. The iodine-polysaccharide complex develops a color depending on the constituent CLs giving a weak brownish color for glycogen and a purple to green stain for, respectively, amylopectin and amylose (20). This procedure allows the identification of low starch amount accumulating strains (yellow), of strains containing starch enriched in amylose (greenish), or accumulating amylopectin only (purple-red).Crosses were obtained by simply mixing the same amount of the two parental strains that had just reached stationary phase in MLH medium (5, 21) at 15 °C.The procedure used to detect starch synthase activities on rabbit liver glycogen containing polyacrylamide gels or to assay the enzymatic activity from algal crude extracts has been already detailed in ref. 5. Briefly, the proteins from a crude extract were separated by electrophoresis in native conditions at 4 °C, and the gels were incubated in the presence of UDP-glucose. The staining of the polyacrylamide gels with iodine allowed the detection of dark bands corresponding to the elongation of the outer chains of the embedded glycogen by starch synthase activities. The starch synthase activities in crude extracts were monitored by incubating 20 to 100 μg proteins in the presence of radiolabeled UDP-glucose as described in ref. 7. The partial purification of starch synthase activities from both wild-type and mutant crude extracts were carried out from 2-L algal cultures in midlog phase. The crude extracts were subsequently loaded onto an amylose affinity followed by anion exchange columns using the settings described in ref. 5. The presence of the different starch synthase activities in the semipurified fractions obtained was assessed by zymogram analyses.Crypthecodinium cultures (1 L) were inoculated at 25,000 cells/mL with midlog phase liquid precultures of known cell density. The starch determination was performed on 50-mL samples of these cultures following the protocol described elsewhere (5). The amount of starch accumulated was assessed >12 days of growth. The starch amount was measured with respect to the culture volume. This value was also adjusted to cell numbers. Cell counts were determined using a Coulter particle counter. Separation of amylose and amylopectin was performed using 15 mg purified starches onto a CL-2B gel permeation column as described in ref. 7. The GPC-purified amylopectins were enzymatically debranched with 10 units Pseudomonas amylodermosa isoamylase (Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratory) at 42 °C for 12 h. The glucose chains obtained were labeled with 8-amino-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulfonic acid, and the CL distribution determined by CE (22). For the determination of the inner core CL distribution, the same procedure was followed, except that the amylopectins were first digested with 17 units β-amylase from sweet potato (Sigma) in 55 mM sodium acetate, pH 3.5, for 4 h at 30 °C before debranching by isoamylase.Dilute starch granule suspensions were allowed to dry on freshly cleaved, glow discharged mica discs glued on copper stubs. The samples were coated with Au/Pd and observed in secondary imaging electron mode with a JEOL JSM-6100 microscope operating at 15 kV.An aliquot of starch granules was centrifuged and the resulting slurry was poured into a 0.7-mm-wide glass capillary. The capillary was sealed, placed in vacuum, and X-rayed with a Ni-filtered CuKa radiation (λ = 1.542 Å), using a Philips PW3830 generator operating at 30 kV and 20 mA. WAXD patterns were recorded on Fujifilm imaging plates, read with a Fujifilm BAS-1800II bioimaging analyzer. Diffraction profiles were calculated by radially integrating the intensity in the two-dimensional patterns.This research was funded by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche grant “GenoFonctDinoFI,” French Ministry of Education, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Région Nord Pas de Calais, and European Union (support to S.B. and J.L.P.).

PMC2805534,"Crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction data of α-galactosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae
",False,"
Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-galactosidase is a highly glycosylated extracellular protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-galactosidic linkages in various glucids. Its enzymatic activity is of interest in many food-related industries and has biotechnological applications. Glycosylated and in vitro deglycosylated protein samples were both assayed for crystallization, but only the latter gave good-quality crystals that were suitable for X-ray crystallography. The crystals belonged to space group P4212, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 101.24, c = 111.52 Å. A complete diffraction data set was collected to 1.95 Å resolution using a synchrotron source.α-Galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.22) catalyse the hydrolysis of α-d-galacto­sidic linkages present in galacto-oligosaccharides and polymeric galactomannans as well as in glucids such as stachyose, raffinose and melibiose. Transglycosylation activity has also been observed in some α-galactosidases. These enzymes are widely distributed in animals, plants and microorganisms and exhibit different substrate specificities and biochemical characteristics (Dey & Pridham, 1972 ▶). α-Galactosidase activity has biotechnological applications in the beet industry in the hydrolysis of raffinose and other galacto-oligosaccharides and in the processing of soybean and other legume products. Organisms expressing α-galactosidase, or the purified enzyme, are also used for biomass and ethanol production coupled to the degradation of molasses. The enzyme is also used as a nutritional supplement in human diets for the treatment of gastric disorders arising from the utilization of galacto-oligosaccharides by the intestinal microflora. α-­Galactosidase is also added to animal feed in order to maximize the energetic conversion of galacto-oligosaccharides by monogastric animals (Sakuraba et al., 2006 ▶; Murphy & Power, 2002 ▶).
Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-galactosidase (ScAGal) is classified into family 27 of the glycosyl hydrolases (Cantarel et al., 2009 ▶) with other α-galactosidases, α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.49), iso­malto-dextranases (EC 3.2.1.94) and β-l-arabinopyranosidase (EC 3.2.1.88). Several α-galactosidases from bacteria are classified into family 36 and both families (together with family 31) are included in clan GH-D. The three-dimensional structures of α-galactosidases from Thermotoga maritima (glycosyl hydrolase family 36; PDB code 1zy9; Joint Center for Structural Genomics, unpublished work), Homo sapiens (Garman & Garboczi, 2004 ▶), Trichoderma reseei (Golubev et al., 2004 ▶) and Oryza sativa (Fujimoto et al., 2003 ▶), and the α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from Gallus gallus (Garman et al., 2002 ▶) have been solved by X-ray crystallography. These proteins display an (α/β)8 barrel as their main structural motif and catalyze hydrolysis by a double-displacement mechanism with retention of the anomeric configuration of the substrate. All the proteins classified as belonging to family 27 by sequence similarity and biochemical evidence are proposed to have similar folds to those reported for the known structures. However, there are some features regarding substrate recognition and specificity, oligomeric state and protein stability that remain unexplained. To our knowledge, no structural information is available for yeast α-galactosidase. Study of the three-dimensional structure of this enzyme is essential in order to elucidate its catalytic mechanism and to fully understand the processes responsible for substrate recognition and specificity. Resolution of the atomic structure of ScAGal will open new perspectives for biotechnological applications and protein engineering. Here, we report the purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction data of ScAGal.The MEL1 gene ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P04824"",""term_id"":""113501"",""term_text"":""P04824""}}P04824) encoding an α-galactosidase from S. cerevisiae was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from the pMelα vector (ampr ori CEN6/ARSH4 MEL1 URA3; Melcher et al., 2000 ▶) and cloned into the YEpFLAG plasmid (ampr ori 2m FLAG TRP1; Eastman Kodak Company) by homologous recombination in yeast strain BJ3505 (pep4::HIS3, prb-Δ1.6R HIS3, lys2-208, trp1-Δ101, ura 3–52, gal2, can1; Eastman Kodak Company). The forward primer 5′-CTATATCGTAATACACCAAGCTCGACCTCGCGATGTTTGCTTTCTACTTTCTCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGTCGT
ACGGGCCCGGATCCATCGATAGATCCAATCATCAATACTTCTCGCC-3′, used for PCR amplification of the gene, carried 30 nucleotides (shown in bold) of the specific sequence required for homologous recombination with the vector YEpFLAG.The final construct was expressed in S. cerevisiae BJ3505 cells (Eastman Kodak Company) grown in 1 l YPHSM medium (1% glucose, 3% glycerol, 1% yeast extract and 8% peptone) at 303 K and 250 rev min−1 for 96 h in a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask. Cells were collected by centrifugation (7000 rev min−1 for 10 min at 277 K) and the extracellular protein in the supernatant was concentrated with the Millipore TFF system and then purified with ANTI-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) packed in 10 ml chromatography columns (Bio-Rad 731-1550). Elution was performed by competition with FLAG peptide following the manufacturer’s recommendations. After elution, 2 mM DTT was added to the sample. Purified protein in 0.02 M Tris–HCl, 0.150 M NaCl, 2 mM DTT was concentrated to 10 mg ml−1 by ultrafiltration with Amicon Ultra-4 (Millipore, UFC 803024). The homogeneity of the purified protein sample was confirmed by SDS–PAGE (Laemmli, 1970 ▶).After protein purification, deglycosylation was performed using endoglycosidase H (Endo H; New England Biolabs). Protein was required in its native form; therefore, the denaturation step required for total deglycosylation was avoided. Endo H treatment was accomplished in 6 h following the manufacturer’s recommendations. An extra purification step with ANTI-FLAG M2 affinity resin (described above) was performed after deglycosylation in order to eliminate Endo H contamination of the protein sample. The deglycosylated protein was concentrated to 2.5 mg ml−1 by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra-4 (Millipore, UFC 803024).Initially, crystallization conditions were explored using high-throughput techniques with a NanoDrop robot (Innovadyne Nanodrop I) and commercially available screens. Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen II, Crystal Screen Lite, SaltRx and Index Screen from Hampton Research and Screen Classic from Jena Biosciences were assayed using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method at 291 K. Drops consisting of 0.25 µl precipitant solution and 0.25 µl pure ScAGal (6 mg ml−1 in 0.05 M Tris–HCl, 0.150 M NaCl and 0.002 M DTT) were equilibrated against 60 µl reservoir solution in sitting-drop microplates (Innovaplate SD-2). Initial hits were then tested on Cryschem (Hampton Research) sitting-drop plates by mixing 1 µl protein solution with 1 µl precipitant solution and equilibrating against 500 µl reservoir solution. Crystallization trials in the presence of agarose were performed by adding 0.2% agarose to the drop. This was performed using a preheated stock of 0.4% agarose in mother-liquor solution. The screening of crystallization conditions for the deglycosylated sample of ScAGal (2.5 mg ml−1 in 0.05 M Tris–HCl, 0.150 M NaCl and 0.002 M DTT) was performed with the PACT Suite and JCSG+ Suite from Qiagen following the same strategy as before. Crystals grew in several conditions with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 as the main precipitant agent. These conditions were then optimized on Cryschem plates and good-quality crystals with a polyhedrical shape grew in 18–20%(w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M bis-tris propane pH 8.5, 0.2 M KSCN. Crystals reached maximum dimensions of approximately 200 × 150 × 150 µm within two weeks.All crystals were cryoprotected before being cooled to 100 K in liquid nitrogen. The drop solution was substituted by a cryoprotectant solution consisting of mother liquor plus 20%(v/v) glycerol. Diffraction data were collected using synchrotron radiation on beamline ID23-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble) using an ADSC Quantum Q315r detector at a crystal-to-detector distance of 283.5 mm and a wavelength of 0.9792 Å. The exposure time was set to 0.9 s and the oscillation range was 1° per image. The collected diffraction data were processed with MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992 ▶) and scaled using the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994 ▶).The preliminary search for crystallization conditions of ScAGal only gave phase separation in conditions where PEG was the main precipitant agent and gave clear drops in almost all other conditions. Small plate-shaped crystals or needles grew within two weeks in two drops with low-molecular-weight PEGs and low pH. Based on these initial conditions, we designed more than a thousand crystallization experiments in order to explore different variables individually. We tested different concentrations of low- and medium-molecular-weight PEGs as well as the effect of pH, salt type and concentration, buffer composition and experimental setup. Optimized medium plate-shaped crystals grew in 22–24% PEG 1000, 0.1 M citrate buffer pH 4.5, 0.2 M Li2SO4. We tested the diffraction patterns of more than 40 crystals, but most of them were twinned and showed weak and highly anisotropic diffraction. In an attempt to improve the crystal quality, we added 0.2% agarose to the crystallization drops. This experimental setup slowed crystal growth, leading to more ordered crystals with stronger diffraction patterns than those obtained previously, but they still showed twinning (Fig. 1 ▶).The best crystals obtained with the glycosylated sample of ScAGal. The crystals in (b) were grown in the presence of 2% agarose within the drop.ScAGal is a highly glycosylated extracellular protein. Post-translational modifications in the secretion pathway lead to a protein in which carbohydrates represent 30–40% of the final molecular weight. These modifications usually make protein samples rather heterogeneous and exacerbate the process of crystallization and structural analysis. One way to overcome this crystallization bottleneck is to reduce the N-glycans to single residues by endoglycosydase-H (Endo H) treatment (Lehle et al., 2006 ▶). Endo H cleaves the oligosaccharide moieties, leaving single N-acetylgalactosamine residues at each glycosylation site under ideal experimental conditions (the unfolded state). Since the protein has to be in a native folded state for crystallization purposes, there are some poorly accessible glycosylation sites that remain only partially deglycosylated; nevertheless, this enzymatic treatment significantly reduced the heterogeneity of the sample without affecting the protein folding. We performed initial screening of crystallization conditions for the deglycosylated sample using the commercially available screens PACT suite and JCSG+ suite and with the same plates, drop size and temperature as used previously. Crystals grew in almost every condition of the PACT screen and the crystal morphology varied from plate-shaped crystals to cubes and pyramids. The best crystals were very small and grew with PEG 3350 as the main precipitant agent. The suitable pH ranged from 6.5 to 8.5, but the best crystals grew at pH values between 7.5 and 8.5. After initial optimization of the conditions, visually good crystals were obtained in 18–20% PEG 3550, 0.1 M bis-tris propane pH 7.5–8.5 and 0.2 M KSCN. Although Endo H treatment was decisive in obtaining good-quality crystals of ScAGal, the pH value was also essential to obtain crystals that diffracted well. As shown in Figs. 2 ▶ and 3 ▶, crystals obtained at pH 7.5 presented a highly anisotropic diffraction pattern, while crystals grown above pH 8 were untwinned and their diffraction patterns were of high quality. It is interesting to note that crystals obtained at pH 7.5 were only useful after annealing treatment (Bunick et al., 1998 ▶). The diffraction data obtained after annealing of crystals grown at pH 7.5 were indexed in space group P422 with four molecules in the asymmetric unit and the maximum observed resolution was 3.0 Å; therefore, further analysis was not pursued.(a) Crystals of deglycosylated ScAGal grown at pH 7.5. X-ray diffraction pattern from these crystals are shown before (b) and after (c) annealing for 1 s.(a) Crystal of deglycosylated ScAGal grown at pH 8.5. Its size is approximately 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.15 mm. (b) X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from this crystal using a synchrotron source. The resolution limit is 2.0 Å (1.5 Å at the edge of the detector).A full diffraction data set of 180° was collected to a resolution of 1.9 Å on the ESRF ID23.1 beamline from a single crystal grown at pH 8.5 (Fig. 3 ▶). Data-collection statistics are summarized in Table 1 ▶. The unit-cell parameters were a = b = 101.24, c = 111.52 Å. Data processing showed that the crystal belonged to the tetragonal crystal system and analysis after scaling of systematic absences in reflection intensities along h00, 0k0 and 00l indicated that the space group was P4212. Assuming that the protein was deglycosylated and a theor­etical molecular weight of the enzyme of 52 kDa, the content of the asymmetric unit was estimated. Only one molecule could fit, with a Matthews coefficient (Matthews, 1968 ▶) of 2.75 Å3 Da−1 and a solvent content of 55.27%. Structural solution was attempted using rice α-­galactosidase (PDB code 1uas; Fujimoto et al., 2003 ▶), which shares 38% sequence identity, as a model for molecular replacement using the MOLREP program (Vagin & Teplyakov, 1997 ▶). A single solution containing one molecule in the asymmetric unit was found using reflections within the resolution range 74.96–2.12 Å and a Patterson radius of 40 Å, which after rigid-body fitting led to an R factor of 0.50. Refinement of the ScAGal structural model is currently in progress.Values in parentheses are for the high-resolution shell.RFL received a FPU fellowship from Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia.

PMC2805709,Sequence and Structural Analysis of the Chitinase Insertion Domain Reveals Two Conserved Motifs Involved in Chitin-Binding,False,"Chitinases are prevalent in life and are found in species including archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. They break down chitin, which is the second most abundant carbohydrate in nature after cellulose. Hence, they are important for maintaining a balance between carbon and nitrogen trapped as insoluble chitin in biomass. Chitinases are classified into two families, 18 and 19 glycoside hydrolases. In addition to a catalytic domain, which is a triosephosphate isomerase barrel, many family 18 chitinases contain another module, i.e., chitinase insertion domain. While numerous studies focus on the biological role of the catalytic domain in chitinase activity, the function of the chitinase insertion domain is not completely understood. Bioinformatics offers an important avenue in which to facilitate understanding the role of residues within the chitinase insertion domain in chitinase function.Twenty-seven chitinase insertion domain sequences, which include four experimentally determined structures and span five kingdoms, were aligned and analyzed using a modified sequence entropy parameter. Thirty-two positions with conserved residues were identified. The role of these conserved residues was explored by conducting a structural analysis of a number of holo-enzymes. Hydrogen bonding and van der Waals calculations revealed a distinct subset of four conserved residues constituting two sequence motifs that interact with oligosaccharides. The other conserved residues may be key to the structure, folding, and stability of this domain.Sequence and structural studies of the chitinase insertion domains conducted within the framework of evolution identified four conserved residues which clearly interact with the substrates. Furthermore, evolutionary studies propose a link between the appearance of the chitinase insertion domain and the function of family 18 chitinases in the subfamily A.Chitin (C8H13O5N)n is a long-chain polymeric polysaccharide of β-glucosamine that forms a hard, semi-transparent material found throughout nature. Chitin is composed of units of N-acetyl-D-glucos-2-amine, which are linked by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds [1]. Hence, it may also be described as cellulose with one hydroxyl group on each monomer replaced by an acetylamine group. Chitin is the main component of the cell walls of fungi [1], the shells and radulae of molluscs, and of the exoskeletons of arthropods, especially crustaceans and insects [2].The breakdown of chitin is catalyzed by chitinases which hydrolyze it to simple sugars. Chitinases can be divided into two major categories: exochitinases and endochitinases [2], [3]. Exochitinases can be further divided into two subcategories: chitobiosidases, which cleave diacetylchitobiose units from the non-reducing end of the chitin chain, and β-(1,4)-N-acetyl-glucosaminidases (NAGase), which cleave the N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) oligomers, generating NAG monomers. Endochitinases cleave glycosidic linkages randomly at internal sites along the chitin chain, eventually providing a variety of low molecular mass NAG oligomers such as diacetylchitobioses and chitotrioses [2], [3].Chitinases occur in a wide range of organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, insects, and animals. Chitinases from bacteria and fungi are extremely important for maintaining a balance between the large amount of carbon and nitrogen trapped in the biomass as insoluble chitin in nature [3], [4]. Chitinases are needed by fungi to disrupt existing cell walls when normal cells divide [5] and chitinases from some plants may be essential in inhibition against fungal pathogens [6]. In insects and crustaceans, chitinases are associated with degradation of old cuticle [7]. Additionally, human chitotriosidase may be important in defence against chitinous pathogens such as Candida albicans
[8], [9].Based on amino acid sequence similarity, chitinases are classified into families 18 and 19 of glycoside hydrolases (GH) [10], [11]. The members of the two different families differ in their amino acid sequences, three-dimensional structures, and molecular mechanisms of catalytic reactions [4]. Family 18 chitinases have catalytic domains of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM barrel) fold with a conserved DxDxE motif [12] and catalyze the hydrolytic reaction by substrate-assisted mechanism [13], [14], whereas family 19 chitinases have high percentage of α-helices and adopt the single displacement catalytic mechanism [15], [16]. In family 18 chitinases, the leaving group is protonated by a conserved glutamic acid, the sugar at −1 subsite is distorted into a boat conformation, and an oxazolinium intermediate is stabilized by the sugar N-acetamido group and then hydrolyzed [14], [17]. Family 18 chitinases are widely distributed in five lineages of life; for example, Thermococcus kodakarensis
[18] in Archaea, Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens) [19] in Bacteria, Coccidioides immitis (C. immitis) [20], [21] in Fungi, tobacco [22] in Plantae, and the sandfly [23] and human [24] in Animalia.Family 18 chitinases can be classified into three subfamilies A, B, and C, in terms of the amino acid sequence similarity [25]. The main structural difference between subfamilies A and B chitinases is that a small α + β domain inserts into the TIM barrel catalytic domain in the subfamily A, while this insertion domain is absent in the subfamily B [26]. For example, human chitotriosidase (PDB code: 1HKM), as a family 18 chitinase in the subfamily A, has a TIM domain and a chitinase insertion domain (CID), which is a module inserted into the TIM barrel (Fig. 1A). In the subfamily A, other additions can occur at N- or C- terminus of the TIM barrel. On the other hand, S. marcescens chitinase C (chiC), belonging to the subfamily B, has a catalytic domain, a fibronectin type III-like domain, and a chitin-binding domain [26]. Therefore the presence or absence of the insertion domain appears to be subfamily specific [27]. Examples of family 18 chitinases in the subfamily B are only limited to a few bacteria, such as S. marcescens and Bacillus circulans (B. circulans) [25], [27]. Here we mainly discuss family 18 chitinases in the subfamily A.(A) Ribbon model of human chitotriosidase (PDB: 1HKM) in complex with the substrate (NAA-NAA-ALI) generated by Pymol, showing the TIM barrel and CID. The helices and strands on the TIM barrel are coloured in green and those on the CID are coloured in light blue. Some residues (Tyr267, Arg269, Glu297, and Met300) in blue on the CID and Asp213 in yellow on the TIM barrel interact with the substrate in red. (B) Schematic representation of the CID between β7 and α7 on the TIM barrel, which is composed of two anti-parallel β-strands followed by one β-strand, one short α-helix, and lastly three anti-parallel β-strands. The arrows indicate β-strands and the rectangles are α-helices. The lines stand for the loops connecting α-helices or β-strands.The TIM barrel domain consists of an (α/β)8-barrel fold and has been found in many different proteins, most of which are enzymes. The TIM barrel domains share low sequence identity and have a diverse range of functions. The specific enzyme activity is determined by the eight loops at the carboxyl end of β-strands [28]. In some TIM barrels, an additional loop from a second domain approaches the active site of the TIM domain and participates in binding and catalysis [28], [29].The CID is the only family in the CID superfamily and is classified as having an FKBP-like fold in the SCOP database (Fig. 1B) [30]. The CID is composed of five or six anti-parallel β-strands and one α-helix and it inserts between the seventh α-helix and seventh β-strand of the TIM barrel [31]. The CID forms a wall alongside the TIM barrel substrate-binding cleft of chitinase which increases the depth of the cleft. Thus, it is easy to imagine that the substrate-binding cleft of chitinases from the subfamilies B and C is not as deep as that from the subfamily A [27]. Interestingly, some mammalian glycoproteins with various functions also exhibit the fold of a family 18 chitinase, such as human cartilage glycoprotein-39 (HCgp-39), whose structure consists of a TIM domain and a CID [32].In addition to the TIM domain and the CID, some bacterial chitinases in the subfamily A involved in chitin degradation contain one or two additional domains involved in substrate-binding [33]. For example, S. marcescens chitinase A (chiA) (PDB code: 1CTN/1FFR) has an additional N-terminal domain [34] which belongs to the E-set domain superfamily in SCOP, whereas S. marcescens chitinase B (chiB) (PDB code: 1E15/1UR9) has one extra C-terminal domain [12] which belongs to the carbohydrate-binding domain superfamily. Removal of such domains often results in enzymes that are still active but show extremely impaired binding to substrates [33], [35]. For example, mutagenesis studies of two tryptophans on the N-terminal domain of chiA resulted in decreased specific hydrolyzing activity thus showing their importance for the hydrolysis of β-chitin [4], [36], [37].As known previously, the TIM barrel is considered the catalytic domain in family 18 chitinases [4], [36]. Although a number of previous publications showed interactions between a group of residues on the CID and the enzyme substrate and reported the possible functional significance of the CID [14], [20], [32], [34], [38], the definitive role of the CID in chitinase function has not been completely determined [17], [24], [32]. For example, the functional contribution of the CID is not clear in the case of S. marcescens chiA [39]. A previous study showed that by removing the CID from S. marcescens chiA, the thermal stability was reduced, the specific activity was decreased, the pH optimum was shifted lower, and the catalytic activity towards long chitin derivatives was lost [39]. However, none of the residues on the CID have been individually mutated. Hence, the role of the specific residues in binding with substrates remains to be identified.To identify the specific functional residues on the CID, a multiple sequence and structure alignment of this domain was constructed. The sequence search process revealed that this domain exists in a wide range of organisms. Conservation and hydropathy analysis revealed that four conserved residues, constituting two distinct sequence motifs, interact with the substrate. Furthermore, extensive comparisons among different family 18 chitinases demonstrated that the TIM domains + CID can bind long-chain substrates by providing a deep substrate-binding cleft, while this may not be the case for the enzymes with the TIM domain alone. In general additional modules fused to a catalytic domain may play a role in substrate specificity by providing a specific binding site or shaping the active site to recognize a substrate with a different shape or size [40]. We extrapolate that this may be a reason for the insertion of the CID into the TIM barrel. This paper identifies and provides initial computational support for the importance of conserved residues on the CID in chitinase function.The representative family 18 chitinases and chitinase-like proteins from plants, bacteria, fungi, and animals whose three-dimensional structures have been determined by X-ray diffraction are listed in Table S1. A multiple sequence alignment of twenty-seven CIDs based on the structures of three model proteins: B. circulans chitinase A1 (PDB code: 1ITX), C. immitis chitinase (PDB code: 1D2K), and human chitotriosidase (PDB code: 1LG1) was generated by MUSCLE in Jalview (Fig. 2). CIDs from organisms in all five kingdoms are aligned, including Archaea, Bacteria, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia (Fig. 2). Because of the conservation of the CID, we can identify the sequences boundaries within the multi-domain proteins and further predict the structures of the domain in sequences of family 18 chitinases without solved structures. Further, the secondary structure of the CID of tobacco chitinase is quite similar to those of fungal chitinases, and thus the β-strands and α-helix of plant CIDs can be predicted.Hydrophobic positions with high conservation (C(i)≥0.45) are coloured in blue and positions with moderate conservation (0.35≤C(i)<0.45) are coloured in light blue. Hydrophilic positions with high conservation are coloured in red and positions with moderate conservation are coloured in pink. Neutral positions with high conservation containing mostly glycine, alanine, or proline are coloured in brown, while positions with moderate conservation are not highlighted. ‘∼’ and ‘→’ indicate the sequences in α-helices and β-strands, respectively. The secondary structure of tobacco chitinase CID was predicted by the program of PSIPRED. ‘ ^’ and ‘#’ represent the positions which form hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic interaction with the substrate, respectively. Smaller alignments can be found in the following references: [24], [31], [33], [78]. The sequences from the following species are listed in the alignment: T. kodakarensis KOD1, Halogeometricum borinquense DSM 11551, Halomicrobium mukohataei DSM 12286, C. Immitis, A. fumigatus, Trichoderma atroviride, C. albicans SC5314, S. cerevisiae, B. circulans, Streptomyces thermoviolaceus, Clostridium paraputrificum, Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396, S. marcescens, Homo sapiens, Penaeus monodon, Acanthocheilonema viteae, Lutzomyia longipalpis, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Hydractinia echinata, Dictyostelium discoideum AX4, Nicotiana tabacum, Robinia pseudoacacia, Momordica charantia, Oryza sativa, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The full genus name and the first letter of species name are shown for each organism in the figure. If two sequences are from one species, a number is added after the species name. All the sequences were obtained from the protein database at the NCBI. Abbreviations: Ar, Archaea; B, Bacteria; F, Fungi; P, Plantae; EE, early eukaryotes; EA, early Animalia; M, mammal.Eight chitinase and chitinase-like structures including the three model chitinases and five more structures (PDB codes: 1LJY, 1FFR, 1UR9, 1KFW, and 1NWT; explained in Table S1) were superimposed on each other based on the CE-MC method (see Fig. S1A). Furthermore, a second and larger sequence alignment with sixty CID sequences was generated using MUSCLE (see Fig. S2).Residues are often conserved in protein families because they either make critical stabilizing interactions or play important functional roles [41]. Additionally, residues important for stability are clustered together in the hydrophobic core and functional residues may be close together in protein-ligand binding sites [41]. Therefore, an analysis of residue conservation is a reasonable approach in which to identify functionally important sites in the CID.Positions of highly and moderately conserved residues (Fig. 3A) and the average hydropathy profile analysis (Fig. 3B) are shown. Our conservation study indicated that there are nine hydrophobic positions with high conservation and five with moderate conservation; five hydrophilic positions with high conservation and two with moderate conservation; and five neutral positions with high conservation and six with moderate conservation (Fig. 2, ​,3).3). Among these conserved positions, four on the CIDs in chitinases denoted by PDB codes 1LG1, 1D2K, and 1ITX are proposed to be important for interactions with the substrate, and five for the formation of the hydrophobic core, as well as the stabilization of the domain (Table 1). Interestingly, these four residues fall into two characteristic motifs, one in the N-terminal region and one in the central region, which are termed the YxR motif and the [E/D]xx[V/I] motif, respectively. These two motifs are also conserved in the larger multiple sequence alignment (see Fig. S2) as well as the structural superimpositions (see Fig. S1B). It should be noted that the use of SAM-T08 program also identified the two conserved motifs.(A) The figure shows the distribution of conservation scores (C(i)). Positions with high conservation are represented by black bars (C(i)≥0.45), positions with moderate conservation by grey hashed bars (0.35≤C(i)<0.45), and positions with less conservation by white bars (C(i)<0.35). The conservation values of the positions with more than one gap in the alignment are calculated as zero. Right insert shows the histogram of conservation in terms of the number of positions. Bars annotated with red stars are the conserved residues which may interact with the substrate. (B) The figure shows the average hydropathy profile analysis in the superfamily. Highly conserved hydrophobic positions are represented by blue bars and moderately conserved positions by light blue bars. Highly conserved hydrophilic positions are represented by red bars and moderately conserved positions by pink bars.In the YxR motif, tyrosine and arginine form a pi-cation interaction, which is conserved in all five kingdoms except Plantae. In many family 18 chitinases, a conserved catalytic residue aspartic acid on the TIM barrel (e.g. Asp213 in human chitotriosidase, Fig. 4A; Asp391 in S. marcescens chiA, Fig. 4C, see [38]), forms an electrostatic interaction with the arginine and hydrogen bonds with both arginine and tyrosine in the motif. The pi-cation interaction, salt bridge, and hydrogen bonding are likely to be important to the structural integrity of the active site including the aspartic acid on the TIM barrel and YxR motif on the CID. These interactions are also conserved in the other family 18 chitinases. Vibrio harveyi chitinase A (PDB code: 3B9A) was proposed to catalyze the substrate hydrolysis following the ‘slide and bend mechanism’ as previously described for a long-chain substrate [17]. First, the sugar chain slides forward towards the reducing end distorting the chain especially in −1 NAG, causing it to bend and take up a transient strained boat conformation [14]. Then the twist of the scissile bond, together with the bending of −1 NAG, makes the glycosidic oxygen accessible to the catalytic residue Glu315 for cleavage [17]. This mechanism may also apply to the other family 18 chitinases. In the protein structure 3B9A, Tyr461 and Arg463 in the conserved YxR motif interact with −1 NAG. They also form hydrogen bonds with the conserved catalytic residue Asp392 on the TIM barrel, which interact with three subsites of (NAG)6
[17]. Vibrio harveyi chitinase A is considered as an endochitinase based on the current literature [42]. However, this is contentious, because its enzyme activity appears to be very similar to that of S. marcescens chiA, an exochitinase [42], [43]. In an exochitinase S. marcescens chiB, it was proposed that binding of substrate causes the −1 sugar ring to distort to a boat conformation and rotation of Asp142 towards Glu144, thus enabling hydrogen bonding between the acetamido group, Asp142, and Glu144. Later on the oxazolinium ion intermediate was hydrolyzed, leading to protonation of Glu144 and rotation of Asp142, which shares a proton with Asp140 [14]. In another exochitinase S. marcescens chiA, after the substrate glycosidic bond is protonated, Asp313 which interacts with Asp311 moves to another position where it interacts with the proton donor residue Glu315, forcing the acetamido group of −1 sugar to rotate. Subsequently, the water molecule that forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr390 and the NH of the acetamido group is displaced to a position which allows hydrolysis to complete [34]. Since the conserved YxR motif on the CID interacts with −1 NAG in S. marcescens chiA (see Fig. 4C), it may help cause distortion of the substrate, thus facilitating the cleavage of the glycosidic bonds along the long-chain sugar. Moreover, the YxR motif in chiA forms hydrogen bonds and provides a hydrophilic environment for the catalytic residue Asp391 (see Fig. 4C), which is in a nearly symmetrical position with another catalytic residue Glu315 with respect to the plane of the sugar ring [38]. Interestingly, Asp311, Asp313, and Glu315 in chiA and Asp140, Asp142, and Glu144 in chiB both belong to the conserved TIM barrel DxDxE motif, indicating that their catalytic mechanisms are very similar.The TIM barrel residues are coloured in green, the CID residues are in yellow and grey, and substrates are in red. Hydrogen bonds are indicated as dashed lines. (A) The conserved residues on the CID of human chitotriosidase (1HKM) either interact with the substrate, or presumably form a hydrophobic core (Table 1). The α-carbon backbone of the CID is depicted as a blue ribbon. Glu297 on the CID forms a hydrogen bond directly with the substrate while Tyr267 and Arg269 on the CID have hydrogen bonding interactions indirectly through Asp213 on the TIM domain with +1 subsite of the substrate. Tyr267 and Met300 form hydrophobic interactions with the substrate. Some conserved hydrophobic residues in grey appear to form a hydrophobic core which is indicated by a dashed pink circle. Other conserved hydrophobic residues face the straight plane which is indicated by a dashed pink line. They are mostly aromatic and their role is undetermined. (B) Subsites from +3 to −3 in the structure of HCgp-39 (1NWT) are lined up on the main chitin fragment. On the CID of 1NWT, Arg263 forms a hydrogen bond directly with −1 NAG and indirectly via Asp207 on the TIM domain. Phe261 forms a hydrophobic interaction with the oligosaccharide. (C) Residues on S. marcescens chiA (1FFR) interact with 7-mer of NAG substrate. Residues in yellow on the CID of 1FFR form hydrogen bonds with the substrate, although some interactions are mediated by Asp391 and water molecules coloured in blue. Ile476 forms a hydrophobic interaction with the substrate. Additional TIM barrel residues involving in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are shown in green and brown, respectively. Structures are visualized and analyzed in Insight II. Structural studies analyzing the interactions between the protein and substrate have been previously conducted by other researchers [32], [34], [43].In the substrate-binding site in human chitinase (1HKM), Tyr267 and Arg269 both form hydrogen bonding indirectly by Asp213 with +1 site, and Glu297 directly with −2 site; and Met300 forms a hydrophobic interaction with the substrate (Fig. 4A) [44]. These amino acids, together with neighbouring residues from the TIM domain, may constitute part of the substrate-binding site of the chitinase. Some of the clustered hydrophobic residues (Tyr303, Val306, Ala312, Val332, and Phe334) form a hydrophobic core indicated by the dashed pink circle (Fig. 4A). The roles of the other aromatic residues (Phe271, Tyr324, Phe326, and Trp331) are not exactly known. Interestingly, they face a straight plane indicated by the dashed pink line (Fig. 4A). In human cartilage glycoprotein-39 (HCgp-39) (PDB code: 1NWT), six sugar-binding subsites in the carbohydrate-binding groove across the C-terminal ends of the β-strands of the barrel were identified from −3 to +3 from the non-reducing end (Fig. 4B). The CID also plays a role in sugar-binding because a complex hydrogen bonding network involving conserved residues Arg263, Glu290, and Thr293 on the CID interacts with −1 NAG and Phe261 forms a hydrophobic interaction (Fig. 4B) [32]. Therefore, the other motif [E/D]xx[V/I] also appears to form contacts with substrate.The other highly conserved neutral positions contain mostly alanine, glycine, or proline; the latter two frequently occur in the structure of β-turns [45] and may be conserved for structural reasons. CID has a large percentage of aromatic residues (e.g. 21% in 1ITX). With the exception of some residues which interact with sugar, many of them exist in the hydrophobic core, which may be important for folding and stability. Aromatic residues have been found to play an important role in stabilizing of proteins and peptides [46], [47]. Therefore, the combination of the CID with TIM barrel may increase the thermal stability of the whole enzyme.Both the NAGase from Elizabethkingia meningoseptica (PDB code: 1EOM) and the NAGase from Streptomyces plicatus (PDB code: 1EDT) are composed of one TIM domain. They break down the glycosidic bond of (NAG)2 to NAG, therefore, they do not have complete chitinolytic activities. In the crystal structure of 1EOM in complex with biantennary octa-saccharide, only the reducing end NAG and two mannoses of the tri-mannose core are in direct contact with the protein [48], while the other sugars extend away from the protein (data not shown). 1EDT hydrolyzes the central β1→4 bond of the diacetylchitobiose core, NAG-(β1-4)-NAG, of asparagine linked oligosaccharides. Unlike the chitinases, the enzyme acts on branched oligosaccharides and has specificities for distinct forms of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides [49], [50].While only four out of eight units of the substrate interact directly with some residues on 1EOM (Table 2A) [48], in proteins with the TIM domain and CID, a broad network of contacts including hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding exists between the substrate and both the TIM domain and CID. This can be seen, for example, in the analysis of the structure of S. marcescens chiA (Fig. 4C, Table 2B) [34].Sun et al. specified that the CID of mouse lectin Ym1 (PDB code: 1E9L) was not involved in the saccharide-binding [51]. Furthermore, they were unable to assign any definitive function for this domain. However, the results of our study indicate that at least four conserved residues on the CID of many chitinases were found to have either hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interaction with the substrate of more than three units of NAG. While 1E9L was not included in the original structural alignment, a close homologue 1NWT was studied and suggests that the authors may have seen saccharide-binding by the CID if a longer substrate was used.In CAZy database [52], S. marcescens chiA and chiB, B. circulans chitinase A1, and Aspergillus fumigatus chitinase B (PDB code: 1W9P) are ‘bacterial-type’ exochitinases with a deep or even a tunnel-shaped substrate-binding cleft, formed by the TIM barrel and CID [14], [43], [53]–[54]. S. marcescens chiC [43], [54] and ‘plant-type’ chitinases such as hevamine from Para rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) (PDB code: 1HVQ) [13], ScCTS1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PDB code: 2UY2) [55], PPL2 from Parkia platycephala seeds (PDB code: 2GSJ) [56], and a hyperthermophilic chitinase from Pyrococcus furiosus (PDB code: 2DSK) [57] are endochitinases with a shallow substrate-binding cleft since they lack the CID. Therefore, overall it appears that the CID may enhance the exo-type activity by forming a deep substrate-binding cleft on the top of the TIM barrel [39], [43], [54].Structures of TIM domain alone, TIM domain + CID, and TIM domain + CID + N- (or C-) terminal domain align very well with their respective counterparts (data not shown). Interactions between residues and substrates are shown in Table 2 for 1EOM (TIM domain alone) and 1FFR (TIM domain + CID). It appears as if more sugar residues interact with amino acid residues when the CID is included in the TIM domain. Therefore, the CID may facilitate stronger association with the substrate, particularly with increasing substrate length. By removing the CID from S. marcescens chiA, a processive exochitinase [36], [54], the truncated enzyme appeared to have a shallower tunnel in the catalytic domain than that of the intact enzyme [39] and it resembled the catalytic domain of S. marcescens chiC, which acts as a non-processive endochitinase [54]. Therefore, the CID of chiA enhances not only the exo-N,N'-diacetyl-glucosaminidase activity, but also the processivity during the degradation of the polysaccharide chains [39].The ubiquitous TIM barrel fold is adopted by seven enzyme superfamilies, one of which is the TIM barrel GH [40]. The evolutionary relationships between different enzymes with TIM barrel are well studied [40], [58], [59]. Gene duplication, gene fusion, and incremental mutations are three mechanisms by which new functions are created in proteins [40], [60]. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of mammalian GH 18 chitinase and chitinase-like members suggest that active chitinases result from an early gene duplication event, which is followed by mutations, leading to chitinase-like proteins, such as chito-lectins [61]. Comprehensive genomic studies of animal GH 18 proteins showed a similar result [11]. Another phylogenetic analysis of catalytic domain sequences from various organisms showed that sequences of animal, fungi, and bacteria belong to different lineage; however, chitinase genes from lepidopteran insects and baculoviruses originated from bacteria and were maintained through evolution since they transferred laterally [62].Since the CID sequences are present in all of sixty archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal genomes in this study, it is possible that the CIDs were present in the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) [63]. However, no evolutionary study has been conducted on the CID by itself. To establish the phylogenetic relationships between the CIDs from different organisms, a preliminary phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the sixty sequences from five kingdoms (Archaea, Bacteria, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia) (Fig. 5). Overall, the CID sequences grouped into five major clusters, each representing one kingdom as to be expected. In the cluster of Animalia, members from early eukaryotes and early Animalia branch out earlier than those from vertebrates and mammals.The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbour-joining method based on the CID sequences: five from Archaea, eighteen from Bacteria, twelve from Fungi, five from Plantae, three from early eukaryotes, eight from early Animalia, and nine from vertebrates (V) including six from mammals. The sequence names, corresponding GI numbers, and abbreviations are listed in Fig. 2 and Table S2. All the sequences were obtained from the protein database at the NCBI.In the study conducted by Nagano et al. family 18 GH were divided into two functional groups; F4 includes chitinases and F5 includes both hevamine and NAGase [58]. A proposed evolution of the structure and function of family 18 chitinases and chitinase-like proteins in the subfamilies A and B can be potentially described as follows. Due to divergent evolution, a TIM domain line may initially have evolved as hevamine, xylanase inhibitor protein, or seed storage protein (e.g. Concanavalin B) in some higher plants, as well as NAGase in some bacteria. While hevamine has lysozyme/endochitinase function [13], [64], xylanase inhibitor protein [65] and seed storage protein [66] do not have known chitinolytic activity. One possible evolutionary scheme suggests that a TIM barrel evolved to a more potent family 18 chitinase in two routes: 1) with the incorporation of the CID to form a subfamily A chitinase and 2) with the other domains (e.g. chitin-binding domain) to form a subfamily B chitinase. In the first route, this double-domain chitinase evolved in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, as well as the triple-domain chitinase with the fusion of N- or C- terminal domain in S. marcescens. Subsequently, the double-domain chitinase gene was mutated to have novel functions in animals [61].Four conserved amino acids identified in this study are proposed to be essential for binding with the substrate and they form two distinguishable sequence motifs. The CID may have inserted into the TIM domain to facilitate orienting and binding to longer (e.g.>3) saccharide substrates. Because of the wide distribution in diverse organisms and the high conservation of the CID, we can identify the sequence and predict the structure of this domain in family 18 chitinases in the subfamily A. An evolutionary scheme is presented which places the emergence of the CID in the context of chitinase function; with the addition of the CID leading to an evolutionary shift of the protein from a non-chitinolytic protein, or a NAGase, to a subfamily A or B family 18 chitinase. We also identify a group of conserved hydrophobic residues in the core which we propose are important for folding and structural stability. Research on the role of the CID in function to test this hypothesis can be carried out using a myriad of experimental and computational techniques such as molecular modelling, in vitro and in silico binding studies coupled to site-directed mutagenesis, enzymatic assays, and crystallization of the holo-proteins.The CID regions within the structures of three proteins: B. circulans chitinase A1 (1ITX), C. immitis chitinase (1D2K), and human chitotriosidase (1LG1) were used as query sequences in PSI-BLAST to search for distant relatives. They represent chitinases within the kingdoms of Bacteria, Fungi, and Animalia, respectively. A plant or archaeal structure was not available at the time however the PSI-BLAST searches did identify plant and archaeal chitinases for inclusion in our study. An initial multiple sequence alignment was made using MUSCLE - multiple protein sequence alignment program in Jalview (Java alignment editor) [67], [68]. In the searched sequences, some from close relatives have high identities >40% (data not shown). Five sequence relatives from each of the five kingdoms and two from early eukaryotes with sequence identities less than 40% were chosen to make the final twenty-seven representatives of the CID superfamily. The alignment was created in order to enhance sequence variability and in this way, only the key conserved residues for structure, folding, and function could be identified. The boundary of the CID in each sequence was identified by aligning with the three model chitinases and the domain was further extracted from each chitinase sequence.An initial structure alignment containing the CIDs from 1ITX, 1D2K, and 1LG1 was generated with the online CE-MC - multiple protein structure alignment program [69]. The initial sequence alignment was compared with the initial structure alignment, and adjusted in Jalview to ensure the sequences with unknown structures were properly aligned with the known structures. Since no structure from plant is available, the secondary structure of tobacco chitinase CID was predicted by the program of PSIPRED [70], and the other sequences were aligned with it thereafter.To verify our sequence and structure alignment, eight representatives of family 18 chitinases structures (1HKM, 1LJY, 1ITX, 1D2K, 1FFR, 1UR9, 1KFW, and 1NWT) were superimposed with CE-MC method [69]. In addition to the twenty-seven CID sequences from Archaea, Bacteria, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia, thirty-three more sequences from Bacteria, Fungi, and Animalia (see Table S2) were acquired from searches of the protein database using the PSI-BLAST program. A larger multiple sequence alignment of sixty sequences was generated using MUSCLE in Jalview, without being edited according to the three model structures. Furthermore, the SAM-T08 program was employed to search for the conserved residues in the CID (http://compbio.soe.ucsc.edu/SAM_T08/T08-query.html) [71].The number of each residue in each position was calculated and analyzed by SigmaPlot 10.0 (SYSTAT Software Inc.). The entropy value was calculated by the following equation:

P
j(i) is the fractional occurence of amino acid type j at each site, and m is the number of amino acid types used in the particular analysis [72]. Furthermore, conservation was calculated by the following equation: C(i) = 1−S(i)/ln(m) [73]. The positions with conservation values greater than 0.45 were considered to be highly conserved; the positions with conservation values between 0.35 and 0.45 were considered to be moderately conserved; and those positions with conservation values lower than 0.35 were considered to be less conserved [73]. The positions which have more than one gap are considered non-conserved and therefore have a value of zero. Hydropathy was calculated by the following equation: hydropathy = sum of the number of each amino acid * hydrophobicity of that amino acid. The hydrophobicity scale of Nozaki and Tanford was used for our studies [74].Select structures from the designated family 18 chitinases in SCOP (http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/) and CAZy (http://www.cazy.org/fam/GH18.html) were chosen to compare the structure and function of chitinases and chitinase-like proteins (see Table S1). Protein data bank (PDB) files were obtained from SCOP and RCSB (http://www.rcsb.org). All PDB files were visualized and analyzed in either Insight II, version 2005 (Accelrys, CA), Pymol, version 0.99 (DeLano Scientific, CA), or Rasmol, version 2.7. Hydrogen bond calculations and van der Waals radii were determined with Insight II.In order to investigate the evolutionary relationship of the CID sequences from different lineages of life, the ClustalW2 program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html) was performed with the sixty CID sequences, because the program can produce a multiple sequence alignment of divergent sequences and Cladogram or Phylogram to visualize the evolutionary relationships [75]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining algorithm as described by Saitou and Nei [76]. The tree was visualized and drawn with MEGA version 4.0.2 software [77].Superimposition of eight family 18 chitinases and chitinase-like structures (1HKM, 1LJY, 1ITX, 1D2K, 1FFR, 1UR9, 1KFW, and 1NWT) and the two conserved motifs on the CIDs. The structures were superimposed with the CE-MC method.

PMC2822703,Glycosidase inhibition: assessing mimicry of the transition state,False,"Glycoside hydrolases, the enzymes responsible for hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond in di-, oligo- and polysaccharides, and glycoconjugates, are ubiquitous in Nature and fundamental to existence. The extreme stability of the glycosidic bond has meant these enzymes have evolved into highly proficient catalysts, with an estimated 1017 fold rate enhancement over the uncatalysed reaction. Such rate enhancements mean that enzymes bind the substrate at the transition state with extraordinary affinity; the dissociation constant for the transition state is predicted to be 10–22 M. Inhibition of glycoside hydrolases has widespread application in the treatment of viral infections, such as influenza and HIV, lysosomal storage disorders, cancer and diabetes. If inhibitors are designed to mimic the transition state, it should be possible to harness some of the transition state affinity, resulting in highly potent and specific drugs. Here we examine a number of glycosidase inhibitors which have been developed over the past half century, either by Nature or synthetically by man. A number of criteria have been proposed to ascertain which of these inhibitors are true transition state mimics, but these features have only be critically investigated in a very few cases.Glycosidases, the enzymes responsible for the breakdown of di-, oligo- and polysaccharides, and glyconjugates, are ubiquitous through all kingdoms of life. Carbohydrate processing enzymes, including glycosidases and glycosyltransferases (the enzymes which transfer saccharides to other saccharide moieties, small molecules, lipids or proteins), constitute between 1 and 3% of the genome of most organisms.1 The task facing these enzymes with respect to maintaining efficient and highly specific catalysis is no mean feat; it has been calculated that there are 1.05 × 1012 possible linear and branched forms of a hexasaccharide2 and that carbohydrates account for around 75% of the biomass on Earth. The extreme stability of the glycosidic bond and the catalytic rates glycosidases achieve mean they are among the most proficient of all enzymes.3 Although glycosidases and glycosyltransferases act on a huge range of differing substrates, individual enzymes must display specificity related to their function. Indeed, the roles of these enzymes are numerous and diverse ranging from glycosylation of proteins in the Golgi apparatus to plant cell wall biosynthesis, from breakdown of ingested material in the gut to defence mechanisms against microbial infection.Great efforts have been made in recent years to design and synthesize inhibitors of glycosidases. Given their multitude of roles in vivo, inhibition of these enzymes in a number of different processes is extremely attractive with potential in the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases,4–7 diabetes8,9 and viral infections10 including influenza11,12 and HIV;13 indeed there are a number of drugs currently on the market which are used in the treatment of some of these diseases. Acarbose14 and Miglitol15 target intestinal tract α-glucosidases and α-amylases in the treatment of type II diabetes. These enzymes are responsible for the digestion of dietary carbohydrates to monosaccharides that can be absorbed through the intestinal wall into the blood stream; their inhibition helps to control uptake of monosaccharides into the blood and suppress an excessive rise in blood glucose. Relenza16,17 and Tamiflu18,19 target a neuraminidase on the influenza virus surface, which during infection cleaves terminal sialic acid residues to destroy the receptors recognised by haemagglutinin, and thus plays an important role in spreading the virus and preventing aggregation of viral particles. Inhibition of the neuraminidase causes the spread of the progeny virus to new cells to be slowed or halted. As with any new drug, the key to producing clinically relevant glycosidase inhibitors is not only high potency, but also specificity over other enzymes which may be encountered. In addition to potential therapeutic applications, glycosidase inhibitors are extremely useful probes for dissecting the subtle differences in mechanism employed by different glycosidase families (see below) and also as tools for chemical biology. In such a regard selective inhibitors can be invaluable for modulating effects in cells or in vivo (for example see Ref. 20, 21).Carbohydrate processing enzymes are classified by primary sequence similarity into ‘families’, which are listed in the Carbohydrate Active enZyme (CAZy) database22 (available at ; http://www.cazy.org); at present there are 115 sequence-distinct families of glycosidases. A feature of most CAZy families is that as the primary sequence dictates structure, and structure determines function, the catalytic mechanism is conserved within a family.23 There are, however, some exceptions such as the NAD+-dependent enzymes in GH424 and GH10925 (discussed further below), GH97 enzymes have recently been shown to contain two sub-families which act with inversion and retention of configuration,26,27 and the GH23 enzymes. Family GH23 contains goose type lysozymes, which hydrolyse with inversion of stereochemistry,28 and peptidoglycan lytic transglycosylases, which use an intramolecular rearrangement, with retention of configuration, to form an 1,6-anhydrosugar product;29 the reaction mechanisms involved, however, remain unclear.Hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond proceeds with either net retention or inversion of anomeric configuration. The ‘classical’ mechanisms for glycoside hydrolysis were first proposed by Koshland in 195330 and, now over 50 years later, have stood the test of time and a vast amount of biochemical investigation and remain largely unchanged (for reviews see Ref. 31–33). Traditionally (although there are exceptions) classical glycosidases possess two carboxylate-containing residues which are responsible for hydrolysis. Inversion of stereochemistry is a single step mechanism (Fig. 1a), which allows both substrate and a water molecule to be bound simultaneously. One of the catalytic residues acts as a general acid and the other as a general base. Protonation of the glycosidic oxygen by the general acid and departure of the leaving group is accompanied by concomitant nucleophilic attack by a water molecule that has been deprotonated by the general base.34,35 Retention of stereochemistry is a double displacement mechanism, consisting of two inverting steps (Fig. 1b); one of the catalytic residues acts as the acid/base residue and the other as a nucleophile. During the first (glycosylation) step of the reaction the acid/base protonates the glycosidic oxygen to aid leaving group departure, which is concomitant with attack of the nucleophile at the anomeric carbon, and leads to formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. In the second (deglycosylation) step the acid/base residue deprotonates a water molecule which provides a nucleophilic species to attack at the anomeric carbon and displace the glycoside.34,35
As structural and mechanistic studies have become more sophisticated, other mechanisms have been proposed for small subsets of glycoside hydrolases, and this information aids inhibitor design for these enzymes. A number of families containing glycosidases which hydrolyse substrates containing N-acetylhexosamine with retention of configuration (which are classified into families GH18,36 GH20,37 GH56,38 GH84,39,40 GH85,41,42 and is likely for GH2543) have been shown to lack a conventional catalytic nucleophile, but instead use a substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism (Fig. 1c). The acetamido group at the C2 position of the substrate acts as a nucleophile to attack the anomeric carbon to create an enzyme-stabilised oxazoline intermediate. The intermediate is hydrolysed by a water molecule, which is activated by a residue acting as a general base. In most cases, a second carboxylate-containing residue orients and polarizes the 2-acetamido group to increase its nucleophilicity. Some sialidases and neuraminidases (such as those classified into families GH33 and GH34) catalyse hydrolysis of sialic acid-containing substrates (in an exo fashion, where only the terminal residue is cleaved), with retention of configuration, using a tyrosine residue as the catalytic nucleophile.44,45 This differs from the ‘classical’ mechanism where traditionally a residue harbouring a carboxylate group is responsible for nucleophilic attack, but a similar mechanism is employed (Fig. 1d). The tyrosine residue relays charge from a nearby glutamate residue to provide a nucleophilic oxygen atom carrying some negative charge; it is proposed a glutamate residue in this position would cause electrostatic repulsions with the carboxylate group of the sialic acid. Other sialidases and neuraminidases (such as those classified in families GH5846 and GH8347), which hydrolyse sialic acid-containing substrates in an endo fashion (where cleavage occurs within a polysaccharide), have been observed to lack the tyrosine residue which acts as a nucleophile in families GH33 and GH34, nor possess a carboxylate-containing residue that could also fulfil this role. Very recently it has been shown for the GH83 enzymes at least, that these endo-sialidases hydrolyze with inversion of configuration.47 As there is only one suitably positioned carboxylate-containing residue in the active site, it has been proposed this residue acts as the general acid, and the carboxylate moiety in the sialic acid substrate acts as the general base; although this mechanism has yet to be verified in a number of enzymes, it does suggest another, completely independent, substrate-assisted mechanism is employed by glycosidases. It has also been shown in recent years that glycosidases in families GH4 and GH109, which both hydrolyse with retention of configuration, use an unusual NAD+-dependent mechanism and that the GH4 enzymes also require a divalent metal ion.24,25 NAD+ is believed to abstract a hydride from the C3 carbon atom of the glycoside to form a ketone, which acidifies the proton at the C2 position and allows deprotonation by a residue acting as a base. This is accompanied by elimination of the glycosidic oxygen by a residue acting as an acid, leading to a 1,2-unsaturated intermediate that is stabilised by the metal ion (in GH4 enzymes). A water molecule attacks at the anomeric position, following base activation, to generate a 3-keto-glycoside, which is subsequently reduced by NADH to regenerate NAD+.A great deal of attention over the past decade has been paid to increasing the potency of glycosidase inhibitors with a view to designing drugs which could be used in a plethora of medical applications. In this review, we will not be discussing any inhibitors which bind covalently to the enzyme, but this has been extensively reviewed recently by Rempel and Withers.48 In many cases inhibitors are proposed to mimic the transition state formed fleetingly during glycoside hydrolysis, but this has been demonstrated conclusively in very few cases. Wolfenden has shown glycoside-degrading enzymes are able to enhance the rate of catalysis 1017 fold over the uncatalysed reaction, making them a remarkably proficient class of enzyme.3 This would translate to an estimated dissociation constant for the transition state to not be greater than 10–22 M, indicating that the transition state binds to an enzyme with extraordinary affinity.3,49 Pauling first postulated in the 1940s that the highest affinity inhibitors for an enzyme were likely to be those that mimicked the structure of a ‘strained activated complex’ 50,51 (i.e. transition state). In the case of glycoside hydrolysis, the short-lived transition state possesses substantial oxocarbenium character (Fig. 2a and b); it consists of partially formed or broken bonds between the attacking nucleophile (which may be a deprotonated water molecule, carboxylate group, acetamido group or a tyrosine residue) and the glycosidic oxygen of the leaving group (or the attacking water molecule in the deglycosylation step of a retaining mechanism). Under these conditions the anomeric carbon possesses trigonal character, which causes sp
2 hybridisation predominantly along the bond between the anomeric carbon and endocyclic oxygen.34 The double bond character imposed on the pyranose ring means there is distortion from a relaxed chair conformation typical of the substrate, which causes C1, C2, O5 and C5 to lie in a plane and to take a more energetically unfavourable half chair or boat conformation at, or close to, the transition state (Fig. 2c).34,52 There is also a considerable build-up of positive charge on the pyranose ring at the transition state, which is delocalised along the bond between the anomeric carbon and endocyclic oxygen.There are numerous examples of glycosidase inhibitors that have been designed, synthesised or tested as transition state mimics. This is largely based on the incorporation of one or more features, such as charge or geometry, which mirrors that proposed for the transition state in question. Some would argue that the classification of these inhibitors as “transition state analogues” is not wrong, as, at an intuitive level the features incorporated in an inhibitor may mimic the transition state. However, to further improve potency of transition state analogues, with the aim of harnessing more of the transition state binding potential, it should be ascertained which are actually true analogues in an enzyme system as opposed to those which bind fortuitously. This is obviously difficult to define, but a number of criteria have been proposed and some are discussed below.One approach for studying transition state mimicry involves investigating linear (Gibbs) free energy relationships (LFERs). For a true transition state mimic, alterations in chemical structure (of the substrate and inhibitor) or the surrounding environment (of the enzyme) should have an equal effect on enzyme rate enhancement and the affinity of the inhibitor relative to the substrate. Thus, for a true transition state analogue, the inhibition constant (K
i) is proportional (by a ‘proportionality constant’x) to the dissociation constant for the transition state. Wolfenden and Thompson (independently) first alluded to this relationship for classifying peptide aldehyde inhibitors as transition state analogues of papain and elastase, respectively.53,54 If alterations are made to the enzyme (by site-directed mutagenesis to active site residues that are not vital to catalysis) or equivalent structural changes are made to a series of substrates and inhibitors so that the uncatalysed reaction rate remains unchanged, then a plot of log K
M/k
cat against log K
i should yield a straight line with a slope equal to 1 if the inhibitor mimics the transition state.55 The correlation does not indicate the degree to which an inhibitor mimics the transition state, but a slope of 1 signifies that an inhibitor (at least the part that has been altered or tested by a mutation in the enzyme) is a transition state analogue (this is well described in Ref. 55). The relationship also assumes there is no change in the rate determining step of the enzyme-catalysed reaction.55
Wolfenden and co-workers have demonstrated that enzymes lower the enthalpy of activation for a reaction substantially, and the degree to which the enthalpy of activation is lowered correlates with the effectiveness of the enzyme as a catalyst. The reliance of enzymes on a substantial enthalpy of activation for the most proficient catalysis means that rate enhancements increase considerably with decreasing temperature.56,57 It follows that the increased affinity for the transition state over the ground state substrate by an enzyme is therefore largely enthalpic in origin. Wolfenden has therefore proposed that it is reasonable to assume that inhibitors which truly mimic the transition state would also derive their binding from large enthalpies of activation. Also, as rate enhancements increase considerably as the temperature is decreased for these proficient enzymes, the enzyme affinity for inhibitors that mimic the transition state should also increase more sharply with a decrease in temperature than those that are ground state substrate analogues.56,57
Some elegant examples of how the predicted structure of the transition state can influence inhibitor design are illustrated by the work of Schramm and colleagues using a combination of kinetic isotope effects, computer modelling, X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.58 The work stresses the need for mimicry of the transition state shape and volume, examination of the molecular electrostatic potential surface similarity between the transition state and putative analogues, and consideration of the energy that every functional group in the transition state contributes to binding with the enzyme. These methods have been employed in the design of extremely potent inhibitors for human purine nucleoside phosphorylase,59,60 the inhibition of which has great therapeutic potential; indeed, these compounds are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of T-cell cancers and autoimmune disorders.61 Similar techniques were used in the inhibitor design of a 5′-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase, which yielded inhibitors in the low femtomolar range.62,63 It is interesting to note that despite significant homology between enzymes from different species, the transition state “poise” varied subtly which aided the design for both potency and specificity, and has ramifications for inhibitor design that may be isozyme, tissue or species specific.58
The number of putative glycosidase inhibitors is continually growing, and it is outside the scope of this review to mention them all in detail. Instead, we will describe the general features of representative glycosidase inhibitors from different classes (concentrating on those that possess six-membered rings and largely omitting the body of work that has been done on the pyrrolidines and pyrrolizidines), which will be used to put the later discussion about the properties of transition state mimics in context; more comprehensive and detailed reviews from the last decade about the inhibitors themselves can be found in Ref. 64–70. By far the most popular way of designing glycosidase inhibitors is to incorporate a nitrogen atom in the saccharide ring and in many cases Nature beat man to the synthesis. Nojirimycin 1 (Fig. 3) was the first natural saccharide mimic to be isolated from a Streptomyces strain in 1966,71 and was originally proposed to contain antibiotic properties. Although capable of inhibiting both α- and β-glycosidases, the hydroxyl group at C1 of the imino sugar is unstable.72 The synthesis of deoxynojirimycin 2, which lacks this hydroxyl group, was accomplished the following year by Paulsen and colleagues,73 and also later shown to occur naturally.74,75 Deoxynojirimycin served as a template for the subsequent synthesis of different glycoside derivatives (some of which also occur in Nature), including deoxymannojirimycin and deoxygalactonojirimycin, and all tend to be more potent inhibitors of α-glycosidases than β-glycosidases.76 1,2-Dideoxynojirimycin, or fagomine, was also isolated,77 but was a less potent inhibitor.78 The drug Miglitol 3,15 used in the treatment of type II diabetes (described earlier), builds on the deoxynojirimycin scaffold with a hydroxyethyl group at the nitrogen atom and Zavesca/Miglustat 4,79,80 used to combat the symptoms of Gaucher disease (by inhibition of the glycosyltransferase biosynthesizing the glucosylceramide substrate which accumulates during the disease), possesses an N-butyl group.Many ideas for the synthesis of indolizidines, where a five and a six membered ring are fused together, also came following the discovery of natural products. Castanospermine 5, first isolated from the legume Castanospermum australe
81 and later chemically synthesised,82 can inhibit both α-glucosidases and β-glucosidases, and may play a role in preventing spread of dengue virus infection by inhibiting an endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidase.83 Similarly swainsonine 6, isolated from Swainsona canescens
84 and later synthesised,85 and kifunensine 7, which was isolated from Kitasatosporia kifunense
86 and also chemically synthesised,87 are both potent α-mannosidase inhibitors;88,89 the latter has shown promise as an anticancer agent.90 Calystegine compounds, which possess a nortropane ring system were first discovered in the early 1990s as natural products in the roots of Calystegia sepium
91 and subsequently a number have been chemically synthesised (reviewed in Ref. 92). They are a complex family of molecules with a naming system based on the position of the nitrogen atom and the configuration of the hydroxyl groups, and many inhibit glycosidases with different specificities; calystegine B

8 is shown here as a representative example. Although 8 is pseudo-symmetrical with respect to its hydroxyl groups, when visualised in complex with a β-glucosidase (Fig. 4a) it was observed in an orientation similar to isofagomine 9 (see below) rather than deoxynojirimycin 2.93,94
Pioneering work in the Bols group in the early 1990s,95–97 and later also by Ichikawa and co-workers,98–100 saw the synthesis of isofagomine 9 and its derivatives. Isofagomine was the first compound to possess a nitrogen atom in place of the anomeric carbon. It tends to inhibit β-glycosidases more potently than α-glycosidases, which may be a consequence of charge accumulation at different positions in the transition state for the different enzymes. Interestingly, the atomic resolution structure of the cellobio-derived form of 9 in complex with an endoglucanase showed the secondary amine functional group was protonated and both catalytic glutamate residues were deionised101 (Fig. 4b). Although 9 is a potent glycosidase inhibitor, it was predicted that the inclusion of a hydroxyl group at the C2 position would increase this potency as this group had been shown to contribute considerable binding energy to stabilisation of the transition state, predominantly through interactions with the nucleophile.102 Although synthesised as a mixture of anomers at C2, noeuromycin 10 strongly inhibits both α- and β-glycosidases.97,103 Another isofagomine analogue, tetrahydrooxazine 11, which was also synthesised by Bols and co-workers,104 possesses an endocyclic oxygen atom as found in native glycosides which enables additional hydrogen bonding potential that is unavailable in 9 and 10. Although a reasonable inhibitor of a β-glucosidase, its lower potency than 9 may be a consequence of the weak basicity of the nitrogen atom which is unlikely to be protonated. An attempt to overcome this came in the form of azafagomine 12.105–107 Azafagomine 12 incorporates two nitrogen atoms, and thus combines features of both 2 and 9; it is possible that either nitrogen atom may be protonated and as such may better reflect the charge distribution at the transition state.The inhibitors discussed so far are typically found in a relaxed chair conformation in solution, although some distortion may occur upon binding to an enzyme. The majority of them possess a protonated secondary amine group (although this has only been shown unequivocally for 9
101), and hence to some degree mimic the charge distribution at the transition state. A different approach is to incorporate group(s) in the inhibitor which causes distortion of the compound to mimic the geometry of the transition state; this may also introduce a specificity element as different enzymes use itineraries via transition states with varying conformations.52 Amidine inhibitors, such as the gluco form 13, were synthesised in the Ganem group in the early 1990s,108 followed by amidrazone and amidoxime (also called hydroximo-1,5-lactam or 1,5-lactam oxime) derivatives, in gluco
14, manno and galacto forms,109,110 which were shown to inhibit both α- and β-glycosidases.110,111 A number of functional groups have been added to the exocyclic nitrogen in order to mimic the aglycon, both with the amidine112-114 and amidoxime/hydroximolactam115,116 inhibitors. In addition the latter has also been synthesised in an oligosaccharide form.117 The conjugation of the carbon–nitrogen double bond of the hydroximolactam group (which has been shown to be exocyclic) and the endocyclic nitrogen atom causes distortion of the ring to a half chair conformation which may mimic the geometry at the transition state.115 Consistent with protonation by the acid/base residue using a lateral protonation mechanism, these inhibitors were synthesised on the premise of providing a heteroatom in the ring plane which should allow a strong hydrogen bond interaction with the acid/base residue.67
Vasella and colleagues pioneered the synthesis of glucotetrazole 15 in the early 1990s, to create a new class of inhibitors related to 2.118 Subsequently other derivatives were developed,119,120 which all proved to be good β-glycosidase inhibitors. The addition of the tetrazole moiety fused onto the pseudo-glycoside ring causes distortion of the ring into a half chair conformation.118 Along similar lines, imidazole (or tetrahydroimidazopyridine) derived compounds, the idea of which came from the naturally occurring inhibitor nagstatin (see below), was again first developed in the Vasella group; the unsubstituted gluco form 16 is shown in Fig. 3. These compounds have been synthesised to mimic different glycosides,121-124 with a number of different functional groups attached to mimic the aglycon,125-129 and in oligosaccharide forms.117 It is interesting to note that if a triazole moiety is fused to the pseudo-glycoside ring (i.e. the nitrogen atom adjacent to the anomeric carbon is replaced with a carbon atom), then extremely weak inhibitors result. This supports the notion that the heteroatom attached to the anomeric carbon makes an important interaction with the acid/base residue; the lone pair of electrons for this interaction is in the plane of the ring suggesting that protonation of the glycosidic oxygen also occurs in this manner.130 The imidazole compounds are more basic than the tetrazole and triazole compounds, however, which has been shown to correlate with greater inhibition.124 Compound 16 is a highly potent inhibitor of β-glucosidases, but a weaker inhibitor of α-glucosidases.121 Atomic resolution analysis with the cellobio-derived form of 16 indicated a strong hydrogen bond interaction between the nitrogen atom adjacent to the anomeric carbon and the acid/base residue; the protonation trajectory was in the plane of the imidazole ring, and the proton was observed to lie closer to the nitrogen atom of the imidazole. Glucoimidazole compounds with the addition of functional groups were synthesised on the premise of increasing potency mimicking the aglycon and thus taking advantage of interactions in the +1 subsite125 (for subsite nomenclature see Ref. 131). These groups did indeed improve potency in many cases, with K
i values as low as 0.11 nM for the phenethyl-substituted glucoimidazole 17.125 The general mode by which these imidazole derivatives gain potency, however, remains contentious; although the observations of phenyl- and phenylaminomethyl-substituted glucoimidazole in complex with a family 3 β-d-glucan glucohydrolase (Fig. 4c), and the manno form of 17 in complex with a family 2 β-mannosidase, indicated there were interactions between the phenyl group and tryptophan residues in the active site of the enzyme,132–134 a similar study with two family 1 β-glucosidases in complex with 17 showed an absence of any such interaction.135
Distortion of the ring to generate compounds which may resemble the geometry of the transition state can also be done by introducing a double bond in the pseudo-glycoside ring itself. Isofagomine lactam, the gluco form 18 is shown in Fig. 3, the synthesis of which was first reported by Williams et al., was proposed to exist as the iminol tautomer where a double bond would exist in the pseudo-glycoside ring with a hydroxyl group at C2.136 Atomic resolution crystallography later disproved this theory and showed it existed as the energetically favoured amide tautomer137 (Fig. 4d). A number of different glycoside forms of isofagomine lactam have since been synthesised, and have proved to be potent inhibitors of β-glycosidases.138 Valienamine 19, and its analogues, have also proven to be potent inhibitors primarily of α-glycosidases.139 Valienamine was first discovered as a product of validoxylamine A hydrolysis by Pseudomonas denitrificans, which in turn was a product of validamycin A hydrolysis,140 and was later chemically synthesised.141 Validoxylamine A142
20 is a pseudo-disaccharide which proved to be a potent trehalase inhibitor;143 the first structure of a trehalase was solved recently and demonstrated the valienamine unit bound in the –1 subsite, and the pseudo-glucose in the +1 subsite.144 The valienamine unit is also found in acarbose 21,14 a drug which targets α-glucosidases in the treatment of type II diabetes (described earlier). The valienamine part of the compound is usually found in the –1 subsite when visualised in complex with an enzyme, such as a glucoamylase,145 suggesting it may act as a transition state mimic.One of the most appealing ways to design a transition state analogue would be to incorporate both the features of geometry and charge present at the transition state. Glyconolactones, such as gluconolactone 22, which unlike many inhibitors possess an endocyclic oxygen atom as in a native glycoside, were first shown to inhibit β-glycosidases (but to a lesser extent α-glycosidases) in the early 1940s.146,147 The conjugation in the glyconolactones was predicted to cause distortion to a conformation typical of the transition state;148 the gluco- and galactonolactone were later observed in a half chair conformation when in complex with an enyzme.149,150 It has also been postulated that the charge distribution of the compounds may mimic the partial positive charge at the transition state.151 Unfortunately, however, these compounds are unstable as they are prone to ring opening, which makes their study as glycosidase inhibitors limited.152 Attempts have also been made to include sulfur in the pseudo-glycoside ring of a number of different glycoside forms, as well as the sulfoxide or sulfone derivatives. In the majority of cases, however, these have proved to be weak inhibitors of both α- and β-glycosidases.153,154 Inhibitors containing a sulfonium ion, where the positively charged sulfur atom in the pseudo-glycoside ring may mimic the charge at the transition state, have been successfully synthesized. Elucidation of the structure155 and subsequent synthesis156,157 of the naturally occurring salacinol demonstrated these compounds were viable, and their inhibition of α-amylases158 suggested they may be used in the treatment of diabetes. Subsequently a number of analogues of salacinol have been synthesized159 and other known glycosidase inhibitors have been modified to possess a sulfonium ion.160,161
Enzymes which catalyze substrates containing N-acetyl hexosamine using a substrate-assisted mechanism are amenable to the design of selective and potent inhibitors which incorporate features designed to mimic the transition state which exists on the way to and from an oxazoline ion intermediate. Early work in the field focussed on PUGNAc 23,162 which possesses an N-phenylcarbamate moiety that makes a number of interactions with active site residues.21,163 The deduction of the mechanism led to the design of NAG-thiazoline 24
39 and the subsequent quest for selectivity provided a number of other derivatives with different lengths of chains19 and groups37 at the N-acyl position, many of which proved to be extremely potent inhibitors. A number of other inhibitors incorporate some of the features already described, combined with the GlcNAc functionality; for example gluco-configured nagstatin 25,164 which is based on the naturally occurring nagstatin and provided the basis for the synthesis of the imidazole derivatives. This was developed further into a PUGNAc-imidazole hybrid164 by the Vasella group and a series of GlcNAcstatins, such as GlcNAcstatin C 26
165,166 by van Aalten et al.; the incorporation of an imidazole moiety in these compounds causes distortion of the ring to a geometry which may resemble the transition state.Inhibitors targeting sialidases have received a great deal of interest over the past decade or so because of the vital role the enzyme plays in the life cycle of the influenza virus and thus the spread of the disease.167 Early work in the field focussed on the naturally occurring 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid 27,168 which contains a double bond in the pseudo-glycoside ring that may mimic the geometry at the transition state. Structure-based drug design methods were used to replace the hydroxyl group at the C4 of 27 with a guanidino group, which lead to the sub-nanomolar inhibitor Relenza 28.16 Further developments were attempted in order to make a drug with better oral bioavailability than Relenza, which was achieved by changing the glycerol moiety to a group with more hydrophobic character.18 This led to the drug now known as Tamiflu 29 which is presently used world-wide in the treatment of the influenza virus.Many glycosidases hydrolyse substrates longer than those which involve a single monosaccharide being present in the –1 subsite, and indeed for a large number it is an absolute requirement. This adds complexity to the study of glycosidase inhibitors, as for many enzymes an inhibitor which is similar in size to a monosaccharide does not provide enough binding potential for the compound to be analysed as an inhibitor; additional residues are required in the other glycon and/or aglycon binding sites for this potential to be realised. If the synthesis of these single unit inhibitors was not enough of a challenge for chemists, the addition of further sugars onto them is approaching a near impossibility. Nevertheless, in a number of cases this has been achieved. Glycosynthases169 have been used to generate cellobio-, cellotrio- and cellotetrao- versions of isofagomine 9 and tetrahydrooxazine 11; in each case the inhibitors became more potent as the length of the inhibitors increased demonstrating the requirement for the binding in the –2, –3 and –4 subsites.170 Others have used a synthetic approach to obtain cellobio- and cellotrio- analogues containing a hydroximolactam (14), tetrazole (15) or imidazole (16) unit. These studies demonstrated that some inhibitors benefited from having additional sugars at the non-reducing end, while others had an improved potency when on the reducing end (where the sugars would lie in the product subsites).117 Xylobio- derivatives of 2, 9, 14 and 16 have also been chemically synthesised.171 In recent years the synthesis of oligosaccharides where the glycosidic oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom has also become extremely useful at providing inhibitors which cannot be hydrolysed by the enzyme.172
Given the volume of publications on glycosidase inhibitors, only a handful have addressed the issue of whether they are mimics of the transition state or fortuitous binders. These studies have been extremely insightful, and although they involve a large volume of experiments and analysis, should be encouraged for other enzyme systems and inhibitors in the future. We will now describe the conclusions from these studies, classified by a number of criteria proposed for true transition state mimics.As alluded to earlier, one approach for studying whether an inhibitor is a true transition state mimic is by measuring LFERs. Thus, for a true transition state mimic, changes in chemical structure of the substrate and inhibitor or the surrounding environment of the enzyme should have an equal effect on enzyme rate enhancement and the affinity of the inhibitor relative to the substrate.55 In real experimental terms, this means that corresponding changes in series of substrates and inhibitors or a series of mutational alterations in the enzyme (that are not vital for catalysis) should influence the K
M/k
cat and K
i to the same extent. Note that this does not demand that the inhibitor possesses every interaction present at the transition state, for it is the relative changes in inhibitor and transition state binding that are assessed. The LFER technique has been applied successfully to a number of studies examining the transition state analogy of peptidase inhibitors.173–176
To our knowledge the first time a full LFER study was conducted for a glycosidase was by Ermert et al. who examined the gluco- and manno-derived forms of tetrazole119 (for the gluco-form see 15), although Field and colleagues had considered correlations between K
i and K
M/k
cat, albeit in a more crude form, in 1991.177 Ermert et al. measured the catalytic rates on two synthetic substrates using a range of enzymes (α-mannosidases, a β-mannosidase, an α-glucosidase, a β-glucosidase and a β-galactosidase) and the inhibition of both tetrazole compounds on these same enzymes. The methods used here are not totally in accordance with the way in which LFERs are usually conducted as the authors chose to test the compounds in a number of different enzymes. It has, however, been shown that different enzymes use various conformation itineraries52 and even very closely related enzymes may have different transition state poise,60,178 and so what may be a good transition state mimic for one class of enzymes may not be so for others. Although it is not entirely clear in the publication which of the inhibition data reported are included in the correlation of log 1/K
i against log k
cat/K
M, the plot nevertheless gives a linear correlation with a slope of 1.1,119,179 which suggests tetrazole-derived inhibitors are good transition state mimics. The distortion caused by the fusion of the tetrazole moiety to the pseudo-glycoside ring into a half chair (or envelope) conformation may therefore closely represent the structure at the transition state.A LFER study of the tetrasaccharide inhibitor acarbose (21) was performed by Mosi et al. using a number of active site mutants of the GH13 cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase.180 The study was conducted using two different synthetic substrates for the enzyme (which differed in length and hence number of subsites occupied), and the dependence of log K
i against both log K
M/k
cat and log K
M was assessed. In each case the plot yielded a reasonable correlation; the log K
i
vs. log K
M/k
cat plot gave slopes of 2.2 and 1.6 for the ‘monosaccharide’ and ‘trisaccharide’ substrates, respectively, whereas the plot for log K
i against log K
M gave slopes of between 0.4 and 0.5. The correlation was better (r
2 of 0.96 vs. 0.81) for the ‘monosaccharide’ substrate, which was assumed to be a better test for the –1 subsite where the valienamine unit of acarbose lies; this comparison does, however, show the influence of the choice of substrate upon LFER studies in general. The authors interpreted the data as acarbose displaying ‘equal mimicry of the ground state and transition state’.180 This, however, is at odds with the derivation of the equation underpinning the use of LFERs, where a transition state analogue is defined only when there is a direct correlation between log K
i and log K
M/k
cat with a slope of 1.55 An independent study by Berland et al. used kinetic methods to determine the k
cat/K
M parameters for a series of active site mutants of a GH15 glucoamylase and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) methods to measure the K
d values for acarbose.181 The plot of log K
d and log K
M/k
cat once again gave a reasonable correlation, with a slope of 2. The authors accounted for the fact the correlation should have a unity slope, and concluded that acarbose is not a true transition state mimic for this enzyme.181 The double bond in the valienamine unit of acarbose may prevent the appropriate ring distortion to mimic the transition state, but nevertheless remains a highly potent inhibitor. During the same study deoxynojirimycin (2) was also studied as a candidate for a transition state analogue, but no correlation was seen between the kinetic and inhibition parameters which suggests it is not a true mimic of the transition state.181
Whitworth et al. examined LFERs with two inhibitors which target enzymes that use a substrate-assisted mechanism.182 They used an elegant system of modifying the volume of the alkyl group of the N-acyl moiety at the C2 position in both the substrates used to monitor the reaction and the inhibitors tested: PUGNAc (23) and NAG-thiazoline (24). The experiments were conducted on the human O-GlcNAcase, which is classified into family GH84. The resulting plots of log 1/K
i against log k
cat/K
M for the NAG-thiazoline series showed a strong correlation with a slope close to 1 suggesting it is a true transition state mimic. The opposite, however, was true for the PUGNAc series, which show a weaker correlation suggesting this compound is less likely to mimic the transition state.182 The results were perhaps surprising given the sp
2 anomeric centre in PUGNAc, which may have been predicted to resemble the transition state more than the equivalent sp
3 centre in NAG-thiazoline, which may have been expected to better represent the oxazoline intermediate (see Fig. 1). The authors postulated that these unexpected results may be attributable to the longer C–S bond length present in NAG-thiazoline in comparison to the C–O bond in the oxazoline intermediate.182 The longer bond length may mimic the partial, but significant, bond order between the nucleophilic carbonyl oxygen atom and anomeric carbon of a late transition state.It is intriguing that the general conclusions in terms of sp
2- and sp
3-centred inhibitors drawn from a LFER study by Wicki et al. were almost opposite to those described for PUGNAc and NAG-thiazoline (although they were tested against different enzymes which may have significantly different transition states). Wicki et al. used a series of active site mutants (both ‘first sphere’ and ‘second sphere’) of a xylanase to assess the transition state analogy for the xylobio-derived versions of deoxynojirimycin (2), isofagomine (9), lactam oxime (14), imidazole (16) and isofagomine lactam (18).183 The log k
cat/K
M against log 1/K
i plot for each inhibitor showed a slope of close to 1, but the correlation coefficients for the sp
3-centred inhibitors (those which were more likely to resemble the charge at the transition state rather than the geometry) deoxynojirimycin and isofagomine were poor (r values of 0.89 and 0.77, respectively, which equates to r
2 values of 0.79 and 0.59 to allow direct comparison with values described below). However, the sp
2-centred inhibitors (which were more likely to resemble the geometry at the transition state) all showed a correlation coefficient very close to 1, suggesting they were transition state mimics.183 These data are in agreement with the earlier study by Ermert et al. on the tetrazole inhibitors, and suggest that those inhibitors which can distort the pseudo-glycoside ring into a half chair or envelope conformation may generally be the best mimics of the transition state.A detailed investigation into the LFERs of 8 mannosidase inhibitors was performed by Tailford et al. with a series of active site mutants of a family 2 mannosidase.134 In particular this study examined a number of manno-derived imidazoles (see 16 for gluco unsubstituted version) and amidines (see 13 for gluco unsubstituted version) with a number of functional groups attached which may mimic the aglycon; all compounds were observed in a B
2,5 conformation in the active site of the enzyme. The substituted manno-imidazole compounds (the three tested had phenethyl (see 17 for the gluco version), phenylaminomethyl and phenyloxymethyl functional groups) all showed a strong correlation in the plot of log K
M/k
cat against log K
i with a slope close to 1 (Fig. 5a) suggesting they were transition state analogues. The plot for the unsubstituted manno-imidazole also had a slope close to 1, but the r
2 correlation was lower (at 0.78).134 The study by Wicki et al. showed the LFER plot for the equivalent xylobio-derived compound had a high correlation coefficient suggesting it was a good transition state analogue;183 this may, however, reflect the differences in the structure of the transition state for different enzyme families. This observation also suggests that, for this enzyme, the presence of the functional group in the aglycon was required to properly mimic the transition state. The two substituted amidines tested, isoquinuclidine and noeuromycin 10, all showed slopes of less than one and poor correlation coefficients, suggesting none of them were good mimics of the transition state.In contrast to definitions of transition state mimicry which depend solely on the intuition or prejudice of an individual scientist, LFERs produce a quantifiable measurement that others can repeat. This does not mean, however, that LFER analyses are without flaws. Firstly, if the goal of the study is to simply obtain tight-binding enzyme inhibition, then a LFER correlation is irrelevant; it would be a mistake to be discouraged by a poor LFER performance if one is primarily only interested in K
i values. The second issue, especially where site-directed mutagenesis is the perturbation of choice in the LFER study, is the selection of the mutations made. Some would argue, for example, that charged inhibitors do comparatively poorly in LFER analysis (discussed in Ref. 134) because the most energetically significant interactions of these charged compounds are with the nucleophile and acid/base residues; the two residues which cannot be mutated in the analysis without compromising the enzyme activity completely. One can imagine that, were it possible, an LFER plot which included nucleophile and acid/base variants would show massive disruption to catalysis and a similar reduction in inhibitor binding. This raises the issue of how to address the compounds that do “poorly” in LFER tests. Do they mimic something other than the transition state, are they fortuitous or adventitious binders, or has the technique itself legislated against certain classes of compounds?As described earlier, Wolfenden proposed that the increased affinity for the transition state over the ground state by an enzyme is primarily derived from enthalpy, and therefore it could be argued that inhibitors which truly mimic the transition state should also bind with large enthalpic contributions.56,57 The issue of which glycosidase inhibitors were likely to be transition state mimics based on their binding thermodynamics was tackled using a panel of 18 inhibitors with a family 1 β-glucosidase.184 Measurements were made using ITC, which gives a direct read-out on the affinity of the inhibitor, stoichiometry of binding between inhibitor and enzyme and the enthalpic contribution to binding, from which the Gibbs free energy and entropy can be calculated (for a recent review on ITC see Ref. 185). All of the inhibitors examined in this study (deoxynojirimycin 2, castanospermine 5, calystegine B
2
8, isofagomine 9, noeuromycin 10, tetrahydrooxazine 11, azafagomine 12, gluco- 14 and galacto-hydroximolactam, glucotetrazole 15, unsubstituted glucoimidazole 16, glucoimidazole substituted with a phenethyl group 17 and a range of other functional groups, and isofagomine lactam 18) displayed a negative and therefore favourable enthalpic contribution to binding.184 Some of the inhibitors, however, harnessed a significant portion of their binding energy from entropy, which questions their ability to be transition state mimics. These include the phenethyl-substituted glucoimidazole 17 (which incidentally was the most potent of the inhibitors examined in the study), isofagomine 2, and calystegine B
2
8. The data show there is no correlation between the inhibitor affinity and the enthalpic contribution to binding, and nor does the chemistry of the inhibitor appear to influence the thermodynamics, at least not on this system.184
A popular way of assessing thermodynamic data for a series of related compounds is using enthalpy–entropy compensation plots. The enthalpy–entropy compensation phenomenon appears to occur in many, if not all, binding studies and is demonstrated by a linear correlation between the enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding for a series of perturbations or changes in experimental variable, such as temperature, series of homologous compounds or mutants.186 Many dispute the significance of enthalpy–entropy compensation, claiming it demonstrates the known thermodynamic laws and the limitations of the values measured.186,187 Compensation between enthalpy and entropy terms is also likely to be evident where the range of ΔG°a values measured is relatively small; this limited range is likely to occur both from the range of values measurable using techniques such as ITC and the values imposed by biology.186,188–190 In addition the intrinsic properties of water are also likely to be important in the compensation. Upon ligand binding a favourable enthalpic contribution suggests solvent molecules are involved in strong hydrogen bonding interactions, but this is likely to be associated with an entropic cost due to the small configurational freedom in the system, whereas conversely the loss of bound water molecules contributes favourably to entropy and the disorder of the system, but unfavourably to the enthalpy term as hydrogen bonding interactions are lost.187,191–193
An enthalpy–entropy plot for the thermodynamic data determined for the 18 inhibitors with a β-glucosidase shows a line of best fit with a slope of 0.93 and correlation of 0.91 (Fig. 5b).184 No related inhibitors, however, such as those which may mimic the charge at the transition state or those which may mimic the geometry, are closely grouped in the compensation plot. In fact very closely related compounds which only differ by one atom type were observed at opposite ends of the trend. The ITC data for three other inhibitors tested with the β-glucosidase since the original publication, two 1-deoxy-6-oxa-N-(thiocarbamoyl)calystegines194 and a 3-imino-2-thia-(+)-castanospermine analogue195 (shown in Fig. 5b), also lie on the best fit line through the points. The castanospermine analogue was shown to differ from the other compounds in that it bound with an unfavourable enthalpic contribution which was more than compensated by a large entropy; despite this different thermodynamic signature, this point remarkably still lies on the line. It is interesting to note that a study investigating putative transition state analogues with the human purine nucleoside phosphorylase, some of which have picomolar affinity, also show strong enthalpy–entropy compensation. In this plot, however, related compounds did tend to cluster in one region of the plot.196
The differences in the (closely) related inhibitors studied are most likely attributed to the effects of solvation and desolvation. Whilst ITC studies can quantify the thermodynamics of inhibitor binding to protein and the subsequent displacement of water molecules during this process, nothing is known about the solvation state of either the protein or inhibitor alone. Homans and co-workers have demonstrated that desolvation of the inhibitor upon binding is likely to contribute significantly;197 it may, therefore, only be when more sophisticated methods are available to measure or model these important contributions that the true thermodynamics of inhibitor binding are revealed.Slow onset inhibition, a phenomenon characterised by an initial rapid catalytic rate by an enzyme in the presence of an inhibitor, followed by a decrease to a slower steady state rate after an amount of time (Fig. 5c), has been observed with a number of glycosidase inhibitors, including nojirimycin 1,198,199 deoxynojirimycin 2,199 acarbose 21,199 isofagomine 9 and analogues,101,184,200,201 castanospermine 5,76,184 noeuromycin 10,184 azafagomine 12,184 hydroximolactam 14,184 glucotetrazole 15,184 glucoimidazole 16
184 and derivatives such as 17
125,184 and isofagomine lactam 18.184 Various reasons have been offered as to why inhibitors may display slow onset. The initial rapid reaction rate may represent formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, after which isomerisation55,202–204 or conformational changes76,203,205,206 of the inhibitor or protein causes formation of a more potent inhibitory species. It has also been suggested the lag phase for inhibition may allow a time-dependent protonation of the enzyme or inhibitor.203,206,207 Slow onset inhibition may also be a consequence of a slow interaction (less than the rate of diffusion) between the inhibitor and enzyme.202,203,208
Schramm and co-workers have suggested that the presence of slow onset inhibition is a criterion for an inhibitor to be a true transition state mimic (although not exclusively).178,209 They believe that slow onset is evident among transition state mimicking inhibitors because they bind to an enzyme that is conformationally optimised to bind the substrate in the ground state. The lag phase before the true inhibitory potential of an inhibitor becomes apparent is therefore attributed to conformational changes that must occur in the active site, which will be less efficient with a transition state analogue than with the ground state substrate for which it optimised.55,178,209 Although evidence of slow onset inhibition is a useful guide when studying inhibitors that are putative transition state mimics, it is highly likely that inhibitors which do not comply also display the phenomenon; this is strongly suggested merely by the number of glycosidase inhibitors which have been reported to show it, as detailed in the previous paragraph. It may also be possible that all inhibitors show slow onset inhibition to some degree, but is more apparent when measuring high affinity inhibition constants at low inhibitor concentration.55
Another proposed criterion for analysing which inhibitors are likely to be true transition state mimics is the comparison of the profiles for pH dependence of inhibition and catalysis.210 A difference in the pH dependence for catalysis vs. inhibition, where, for example, an inhibitor inhibits most effectively when the enzyme is largely inactive, suggests it cannot be a true transition state mimic, as, by definition, a catalytically inactive enzyme cannot bind the transition state.211,212 A study which examined the pH profiles for both catalysis and inhibition using 18 putative transition state analogues indicated that in very few cases did the profile for inhibition mirror that for catalysis.184 This was only apparent for tetrahydrooxazine (11), the hydroximolactam analogues (14) (Fig. 5d) and glucotetrazole (15); each of these compounds has a low pK
a value (3.6 for 11,104 4.8 for 14
111 and –4.0 for 15
124) and so the titration is likely to reflect the catalytic residues rather than the inhibitor itself. In fact, it has been suggested the pH profile for inhibition will only mirror catalysis when the pK
a of the inhibitor is below that of the acidic catalytic residue of the enzyme,213 but if this was the case it would seem intuitively incorrect to assume these were transition state analogues. A counter-argument can be made here though, as at the transition state both the nucleophile and acid/base residues may both be partially deionised, and thus tight-binding displayed by inhibitors at high pH where the enzyme is doubly deionised may actually better reflect the real situation.213 If this was the case then deoxynojirimycin 2, castanospermine 5, calystegine B
2
8, isofagomine 9, noeuromycin 10, glucoimidazole 16 and some of it derivatives, such as 17, would all be candidates as transition state analogues.It should be acknowledged, however, that analysis of pH profiles for catalysis and inhibition are extremely circumspect. McIntosh et al. have described how the pK
a values of the catalytic residues of a xylanase ‘cycle’ during catalysis, with changes of up to 2.5 pH units.214 Although it is assumed in most cases that the acidic limb of pH dependence for catalysis demonstrates titration of the nucleophile residue and the basic limb titration of the acid/base residue, and that at the pH optimum for catalysis, the acid/base will be protonated and the nucleophile deprotonated, it is impossible to assign this unequivocally in each case. Measurement of the microscopic pK
a values of the acid/base and nucleophile demonstrate that they are heavily reliant on the ionisation state of the other.214 If the pK
a values of the catalytic residues change by as much as 2.5 pH units during hydrolysis, the question has to be raised as to their likely values at the transition state, but this can never be determined. It does have wide implications, however, for the likely pK
a values of the catalytic residues when bound to inhibitors that may mimic the transition state. The presence of inhibitors complicate the matter even further as they themselves may be protonated, or indeed their protonation state may change upon binding to the enzyme. Atomic resolution X-ray crystallography has indicated that upon inhibitor binding the ionisation state of the catalytic residues can easily change (although they themselves may be influenced by the crystallisation conditions); for example, the xylobio-derived forms of 2
215 and 18
137 bound to an enzyme where the nucleophile and acid/base had reversed protonation states than required for catalysis, and the cellobio-derived form of 9 bound to an enzyme where both residues were deionised.101 Catalytic residues and inhibitors may also be subject to pK
a changes upon binding, meaning the pK
a values determined for each in the free state are meaningless.213 Both Knowles216 and Brocklehurst217 have warned about the risks involved with analysing pH dependence data, both for catalysis and inhibition. The pH profiles for inhibition are likely to reflect composites of the free enzyme, free inhibitor and the enzyme-inhibitor complex.216
This article, and a number of other reviews in the glycosidase inhibition field (including Ref. 64–70), have demonstrated that the quest for potent and selective inhibitors is extremely active at present. The involvement of glycosidases in lysosomal storage disorders, cancer, viral infections and diabetes demonstrates the need to continue strong and fruitful research in this area. It is, however, perhaps a little alarming to acknowledge the small gains in potency made in these inhibitors over the past 50 years or so. As Wolfenden has demonstrated the binding potential of the transition state to be approximately 10–22 M,56 it has been proposed that if features of the transition state could be included in the design of inhibitors, then higher potency should result. In many cases this has been achieved on an intuitive level, where aspects of the transition state charge or geometry have been introduced into inhibitors. However, the exact nature of the transition state is unknown, and indeed will differ between individual enzymes, and so more quantitative methods are required to gain confidence in the transition state analogy. A number of criteria for transition state mimicry have been proposed, and have been discussed in relation to inhibitors where they have been tested. Of these, it is perhaps the LFERs that use the most quantitative means to test the likelihood of an inhibitor mimicking the transition state, although still gives a qualitative answer. It is interesting also to note that different conclusions were drawn from the same ‘classes’ of inhibitors with the different enzymes described here which may reflect the subtleties of the transition state in each case. This point has been highlighted previously by Schramm and colleagues by demonstrating that the bovine, human and Mycobacterium species forms of an enzyme utilised either an early (more like the substrate) or late (more like the product) transition state, and that by incorporating features into inhibitors to mimic each of these structures, different compounds inhibited each of the enzymes optimally.60,178 Indeed, it has also been suggested that the structure of the transition state may change with the evolution of an enzyme.218 It is, of course, not possible for any compound to mimic the transition state in its entirety as it would have to include partially formed and broken bonds, a partial positive charge and a trigonal centre which is chemically challenging; harnessing the full binding potential of the transition state is therefore never going to be realised.It can, of course, be argued that highly effective inhibitors do not have to mimic the transition state and there are a plethora of potent and specific drugs in clinical use as examples. A favourable combination of the necessary hydrogen bond, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions can lead to inhibitors that bear little resemblance to the transition state. A picomolar inhibitor (methotrexate) of dihydrofolate reductase was observed using X-ray crystallography to actually bind upside down when compared to the substrate, even though very similar interactions were made, demonstrating that Nature can be unpredictable.219 Indeed an array of glycosidase inhibitors have been identified which not only lack features of the transition state, but any resemblance of a carbohydrate moiety; these include inhibitory proteins,220,221 cyclopeptides,222 amines (which is why Tris buffer is often observed to inhibit glycosidases)211 and phenyl-imidazole compounds.223
Although the potency of glycosidase inhibitors has been slow to improve over the past half century, it is perhaps only in the past decade or so that the detailed understanding of reaction mechanism and transition state structure, chemical synthetic methods to allow inhibitors incorporating different features to be synthesised and computer modelling to aid inhibitor design, in addition to techniques such as kinetics for measurements of LFERs and ITC for determination of thermodynamic signatures, have developed sufficiently to realise their full potential in inhibitor design. Schramm and colleagues have elegantly demonstrated the power of combining techniques such as X-ray crystallography, computer modelling and kinetic isotope effects to deduce the structure of the transition state and design analogues,62,63,178,209 which has led to the production of picomolar or femtomolar inhibitors of enzymes with a number of medical applications. Their studies have highlighted some of the subtleties of transition state mimic design, which, in conjunction with the enhanced methodologies should now be used to catalyse the advancement of potency for glycosidase inhibitors. Given the extremely tight binding of the transition state in glycoside hydrolysis, the design of inhibitors that mimic its structure must be one of the most efficient ways of achieving highly potent drugs in the quest for inhibiting glycosidases in the future.T.M.G is a Sir Henry Wellcome postdoctoral fellow and a Michael Smith for Health Research trainee award holder, and G.J.D is a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award recipient.

PMC2832021,Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Ehrlichia chaffeensis Tandem Repeat Proteins Reveals Evidence of Phosphorylation and Absence of Glycosylation,False,"
Ehrlichia chaffeensis has a small subset of immunoreactive secreted, acidic (pI ∼4), tandem repeat (TR)-containing proteins (TRPs), which exhibit abnormally large electrophoretic masses that have been associated with glycosylation of the TR domain.In this study, we examined the extent and nature of posttranslational modifications on the native TRP47 and TRP32 using mass spectrometry. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) demonstrated that the mass of native TRP47 (33,104.5 Da) and TRP32 (22,736.8 Da) were slightly larger (179- and 288-Da, respectively) than their predicted masses. The anomalous migration of native and recombinant TRP47, and the recombinant TR domain (C-terminal region) were normalized by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) modification of negatively charged carboxylates to neutral amides. Exhaustive tandem mass spectrometric analysis (92% coverage) performed on trypsin and Asp-N digested native TRP47 identified peptides consistent with their predicted masses. Two TRP47 peptides not identified were located in the normally migrating amino (N)-terminal region of TRP47 and contained predicted phosphorylation sites (tyrosine and serine residues). Moreover, native TRP47 was immunoprecipitated from E. chaffeensis-infected cell lysate with anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-pTyr) antibody.TRP47 and TRP32 are not modified by glycans and the substantial net negative charge of the ehrlichial TRPs, and particularly the highly acidic TRs present within the ehrlichial TRPs, is responsible for larger-than-predicted masses. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that the N-terminal region of the TRP47 is tyrosine phosphorylated.Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME) is an emerging life-threatening tick-borne zoonosis caused by the obligately intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis. E. chaffeensis exhibits tropism for mononuclear phagocytes, and survives by evading the innate host defenses [1]–[3]. A small subset of E. chaffeensis proteins react strongly with antibodies in sera from infected humans or dogs [4]–[7], and the molecularly characterized immunoreactive proteins of E. chaffeensis include tandem repeat protein (TRP) 47, TRP120, and TRP32 (variable-length PCR target) [8]–[10]. The TR domains of the TRPs are acidic, exhibit high serine/threonine content, have predicted sites for posttranslational modifications (glycosylation and/or phosphorylation), exhibit larger-than-predicted molecular masses during electrophoresis, and contain major continuous immunodeterminants [8]–[10].Various functions have been associated with TRPs in pathogenic bacteria, including immune evasion, adhesion, actin nucleation, and other host-pathogen interactions [11]–[18]. Similarly, TRPs identified in E. chaffeensis and E. ruminantium and closely related Anaplasma marginale appear to play a role in cell adhesion [19]–[23], but the function of several immunoreactive TRPs in A. phagocytophilum is still unknown [24]. A more recent study has demonstrated that E. chaffeensis TRP47 interacts with a network of host cell proteins involved in signaling, modulation of gene expression, and intracellular vesicle trafficking [25]. E. chaffeensis TRP47 is acidic (pI 4.2), contains seven 19-mer TRs (pI 2.9) in the C-terminal domain, and has a predicted molecular mass of 33 kDa, but exhibits an electrophoretic mass of ∼47 kDa. The TRP47 C-terminal TR domain is homologous to renin receptor, DNA polymerase III subunits gamma and tau-conserved domain, and ribonuclease E. E. chaffeensis TRP32 is acidic (pI, 4.1), contains four TRs, and also migrates at a larger (32 kDa) than predicted (22.5 kDa) mass.Glycoproteins have been identified in many bacteria including Borrelia, Chlamydia, Escherichia, Neisseria, and Pseudomonas
[26], [27], and many of the characterized glycoproteins appear to be involved in host-pathogen interactions [20], [26]–[30]. Moreover, carbohydrate has been detected on Ehrlichia and Anaplasma outer membrane proteins and TRPs [8], [20], [28], [31]–[35]. Glycosyltransferases have been identified in the genomes of many bacteria that have glycoproteins; however, glycosyltransferases have not been identified in Ehrlichia spp. genomes [36]–[38], suggesting that additional studies to define the mass of these proteins in order to understand the extent and nature of the glycans (composition, structure and attachment sites) on the native and recombinant proteins are needed.The objective of this study was to examine the native and recombinant E. chaffeensis TRP47 and TRP32 using mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF and MS/MS), in order to define the posttranslational modifications. We determined by mass spectrometry that the native TRP47 and TRP32 were nearly identical to the predicted mass. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the highly acidic TRs present within the ehrlichial TRPs are responsible for the anomalous electrophoretic behavior of these proteins and not glycosylation. Moreover, we provide mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation evidence that TRP47 is tyrosine phosphorylated.Examination of the E. chaffeensis-secreted proteome by Western immunoblotting using dog anti–E. chaffeensis identified several major immunoreactive proteins (Figure 1A). The highly acidic TRPs proteins, including TRP120 (pI 4.1), TRP47 (pI 4.2), and TRP32 (pI 4.1), which were distinctly separated and resolved during 2-DE, were clearly visible on the left side of the immunoblot forming a column at positions corresponding to their pIs (between 4.0 and 4.5) and molecular masses. All of these proteins migrated at larger-than their predicted molecular masses, ∼100-, 47- and 32-kDa, respectively (Figures 1B and 1C). Each of these proteins was identified with TRP-specific antibodies (see insets Figure 1B). The TRP47 and TRP32 were examined further to define the posttranslational modifications.(A) Cell-free supernatant collected from E. chaffeensis infected DH82 cells was precipitated with 20% ammonium sulfate before separation by SDS-PAGE. The TRP32, TRP47, TRP120, and Ank200 were major immunoreactive proteins as determined by Western immunoblotting with canine anti-E. chaffeensis serum. (B) Western immunoblot and (C) silver stained gel of E. chaffeensis-secreted proteins collected from cell-free E. chaffeensis-infected DH82 cells resolved by 2-DE. The approximate pH and molecular mass standards of the proteins are shown on top and left side of the Western immunoblot and silver stained gel images. The E. chaffeensis 2-DE gel resolved proteins were detected by anti-E. chaffeensis serum. The arrow indicates the three acidic, major immunoreactive proteins separated by 2-DE according to their respective pI and larger-than-the-predicted molecular mass (TRP120, TRP47, and TRP32). TRP120, −47, and −32 spots detected with protein-specific antibodies are shown as insets, from top to bottom on right side of the image (B).We determined the mass of the native TRP32 and TRP47 purified from 2-DE by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For native E. chaffeensis TRP47, the mass spectrum was recorded within the range of m/z 5,000 to 50,000 and a singly charged ion was recorded at 33,104.5 m/z demonstrating the molecular mass of native TRP47 was 179 Da larger than the predicted molecular mass of 32,925 Da (Figure 2A and Table 1). The mass spectrum of native TRP32 was recorded within the m/z range of 5,000 to 40,000. A singly charged ion was recorded at 22,736.8 m/z demonstrating that native TRP32 was 288 Da larger than the predicted molecular mass of 22,449 Da (Figure 2B and Table 1). We also examined the recombinant TRP47 proteins GST-TRP47 and GST-CterTRP47 that also exhibited larger than their predicted molecular masses by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant GST-TRP47 and GST-CterTRP47 molecular mass as determined by MALDI-TOF was 56,698 Da (predicted 56,581) and 43,522 Da (predicted 43,525), respectively, and close to the predicted masses demonstrating that these polypeptides were not modified (Table 1).(A) For native TRP47, the mass-spectrum was recorded within the range of m/z 5,000 to 50,000 illustrates a peak of TRP47 singly charged ion (33,104.5). (B) For native TRP32, the mass-spectrum recorded within the range of m/z 5,000 to 40,000 illustrates a peak of the TRP32 singly charged ion (22,736.8). The relative intensities of the ions are shown on the y axis; the mass to charge ratios are shown on the x axis.MALDI-MS performed on trypsin-digested TRP47 peptides exhibited high relative intensity of several abundant ions (m/z). Those abundant ions with high relative intensity were selected for further MS/MS analysis. For protein/peptide identification, the bacteria NCBI endopeptidase taxonomy searched in the NCBI non redundant database identified three peptides with significant protein/peptide match, based on both the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) and the MS/MS data from several precursor ions with low expectation values and high protein score. A total of 12% sequence coverage was achieved with trypsin digested TRP47, which included three of the nine peptides that were generated from typsin-digestion (Table 2). The identified peptides were NNGHVISDFR, GVQAENFVFDIK, and DSLLNEEDMAAQFGNR with molecular masses of 1158.2, 1366.5, and 1809.9 Da, respectively, and consistent with the predicted molecular masses indicating they were not posttranslationally modified. The remaining six peptides were not identified by MS/MS analysis of TRP47 tryptic digests.To obtain more sequence coverage, TRP47 was digested with Asp-N endopeptidase resulting in 23 peptide fragments. Twenty-one peptides with molecular masses were identified extending the total TRP47 sequence coverage to 90%, and these peptides all had masses that matched their predicted molecular masses (Table 3). The acidic TRs of TRP47, which exhibited abnormal electrophoretic mobility and contained predicted sites of posttranslational modifications (phosphorylation/glycosylation) were also identified. Their molecular masses were consistent with their predicted molecular masses demonstrating absence of posttranslational modifications. Two unidentified peptides (DHGYHILFKNNGHVIS and DSIVVPVLEGNASVSEG) with predicted molecular masses of 1851.0 and 1671.8 Da, respectively, were located in the normally migrating amino-terminal part of TRP47 (outside the TR containing region of TRP47). The peptide DHGYHILFKNNGHVIS contains a single tyrosine (Y44), and peptide DSIVVPVLEGNASVSEG has three serine residues (S148, S159, S161), and NetPhos 2.0 prediction server identified Y44, S159, and S161 as phosphorylation sites (Table 3). In addition, phosphopeptides were not detected by analysis with ESI-LC MS/MS and MALDI MS/MS on phosphopeptide-enriched TRP47 trypsin and Asp-N digests.We have previously [25] demonstrated that TRP47 physically interacts with protein tyrosine kinase, FYN and genes encoding protein tyrosine kinases are not present in the E. chaffeensis genome [36]. Based on our present MALDI-TOF analysis of native TRP47 (small mass difference suggesting phosphorylation and not glycosylation) and previous observations, we hypothesized that upon E. chaffensis interaction with the host cell, TRP47 is phosphorylated by a host cell kinase. To test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated proteins from E. chaffeensis- infected THP-1 cells with anti-pTyr and detected the immunoprecipitated proteins with TRP47 antibody. TRP47 was detected only in E. chaffeensis- infected cell lysate precipitated with anti-pTyr, but not with normal mouse IgG (Figure 3).Whole cell lysates from uninfected (THP-1) and E. chaffeensis-infected THP-1 cells (ECH) probed with anti-TRP47 antibody [lanes 1 and 2]. ECH whole cell lysates immunoprecipitated with, mouse anti-pTyr antibody (pTyr-IP, lane 3), normal mouse IgG (IgG-IP, lane 4) and detected with TRP47 antibody.
E. chaffeensis TRP47 is a 316 amino acid, acidic (pI, 4.2), secreted, protein containing seven 19-mer TRs (ASVSEGDAVVNAVSQETPA) that encompasses the majority of the carboxy (C)-terminal portion of the protein. The TR domain is more acidic (pI 2.9) than the amino (N)-terminal region (pI 5.0) (Figure 4B). Based on the amino acid sequence, TRP47 contains a typical percentage (15%) of acidic residues, but a much lower (3%) percentage of basic residues (Table 4). To demonstrate that the acidic nature of the protein contributed substantially to the abnormal electrophoretic behavior, we chemically modified native TRP47 and recombinant GST-TRP47, GST-NterTRP47, and GST-CterTRP47 with EDC in the presence of an excess of an amine which converts negatively charged carboxylates into neutral amides (by neutralizing negatively charged acidic residues). EDC-modified native TRP47, GST-TRP47, and GST-CterTRP47 migrated faster at about 37±3 kDa, 60±3 kDa, and 46±3 kDa, close to their true molecular masses, than the unmodified proteins that migrate at 47 kDa, 67 kDa, and 55 kDa in SDS-PAGE gel (Figures 4A, 4C and Table 4). However, the migration of the less acidic proteins such as GST-only (pI 5.9) and GST-NterTRP47 (pI 5.5) were unchanged after EDC treatment, suggesting numerous acidic residues present on TRP47 and C-terminal TRP47 (GST-CterTRP47) are responsible to a large extent for the anomalous migration of these proteins on SDS-PAGE (Figure 4C and Table 4). EDC-modification of native and recombinant TRP47 resulted in much more diffused electrophoretic bands and dimers and trimers representing intermolecular cross-linkages were observed (Figures 4A and 4C).(A) Western immunoblot of native TRP47 detected with rabbit anti-TRP47 serum.

Furthermore, native and recombinant Ehrlichia TRPs exhibit nearly identical larger than predicted molecular masses, suggesting that the native and recombinant proteins have similar properties and modifications. The basis of the anomalous migration of TRPs had been previously associated with posttranslational glycosylation, particularly by O-linked glycosylation of Ehrlichia TRPs based primarily on the larger than predicted molecular masses, detection of carbohydrate on recombinant TRP proteins, the high proportion of serine/threonine residues (O-linked glycosylation sites), similarity to other O-glycosylated (mucin-like) proteins, and predictions (YinOYang 1.2, NetOGlyc 3.1) that identified potential O-linked glycosylation sites [8], [31], [32]. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that many pathogenic bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Helicobacter pylori, and Campylobacter coli are capable of O-linked protein glycosylation with a wide variety of carbohydrates [39]–[43], and glycosylated proteins exhibit an abnormal migration in SDS-PAGE [26]. However, mass spectrometry had not been performed to unequivocally determine the mass of the native or recombinant Ehrlichia TRPs and the exact nature of the posttranslational modifications and the glycan attachment sites.In this investigation, we examined two molecularly characterized E. chaffeensis TRPs in order to fully understand the nature of posttranslational modifications associated with these proteins. A primary goal of this study was to examine the native ehrlichial proteins, so that differences in native and recombinant protein modifications could be determined. MALDI-TOF demonstrated that the masses of native TRP47 and TRP32 were slightly larger (179- and 288-Da, repectively) than their predicted masses, and too small to account for glycan modification. Similarly, the recombinant TRP47 fragments had masses that were consistent with their predicted masses, demonstrating that glycan modifications were not present. We have also reported similar observations with regard to other recombinant ehrlichial TRPs, including TRP32 and TRP120 that exhibited larger than predicted masses [9], [44].We also investigated the small mass difference of the native TRP47 to explore the possibility of phosphorylation. Exhaustive MS/MS of the native TRP47 identified all peptides except two associated with the N-terminal region of the protein that also contained predicted phosphorylation sites (NetPhos 2.0). Protein phosphorylation is one of the important posttranslational modification processes reported on effector proteins of other obligately intracellular organisms such as Chlamydia trachomatis and A. phagocytophilum
[45]–[49]. Thus, the inability to detect these peptides could be related to phosphorylation, which results in a lower level of ionization, and a characteristic of phosphorylated peptides. Identifying phosphorylation sites using mass spectrometry has proved to be a challenging task particularly when there are very few phosphorylated peptides present in the digested sample [50], [51].In our previous study, we have demonstrated that TRP47 is present on the surface of dense-cored ehrlichiae and interacts with the host tyrosine kinase FYN [25]. In this present study, we demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with anti-pTyr antibody that TRP47 is tyrosine phosphorylated, presumably by a host cell tyrosine kinase. Two peptides unidentified by MS/MS were 41-DHGYHILFK-49 and 147-DSIVVPVLEGNASVSEG-163, which contain predicted phosphorylation sites (Y44, S148, S159, S161). As discussed earlier, phosphorylated peptides do not ionize efficiently and are often undetected by mass spectrometry, and thus could explain our inability to identify these peptides by this method [50], [51]. Immunoprecipitaion of TRP47 with anti-pTyr antibody provides evidence that this protein is phosphorylated and the MS-MS results confirmed that all peptides identified were unmodified, except two containing potential phosphorylation sites. NetPhos prediction indicated that most probable TRP47 phosphorylated residues were Y44 (peptide 41–49) and S159 and/or S161 (peptide 147–163). The small molecular mass differences between the predicted and MALDI-TOF and MS/MS observed for native TRP47 (179 Da) and TRP32 (288 Da) suggest that the mass of the modifications is consistent with two or three phosphates outside the TR region, and confirmed that the abnormally migrating TR region is not modified by glycans or phosphate.We determined that the abnormal electrophoretic masses of the TRP47 were associated with the highly acidic TR domain, suggesting that the abnormal migration is due to acidic nature of the TRs within these ehrlichial TRPs [9], [44]. All of the characterized Ehrlichia TRPs that exhibit abnormal electrophoretic masses are acidic, and this biophysical property has been associated with abnormal electrophoretic migration of other acidic proteins such as caldesmon, HPV 16 E7, ribonuclease U2, and Gir2 [52]–[55]. EDC-modified native TRP47, recombinant GST-TRP47 and GST-CterTRP47 having a substantially higher number of acidic residues compared to the basic residues (ratio of 2∶1 to 6∶1) migrated much faster than the unmodified protein, close to their predicted molecular masses as observed by others [52]. The migration of GST and GST-NterTRP47 having similar numbers of acidic and basic residues (the ratio of acidic/basic residues between 1-1.5∶1) did not change after EDC modification. The EDC-modified protein exhibited a more diffused electrophoretic band than that of unmodified protein, an effect that could be due to different levels of esterification and some EDC-mediated intermolecular cross-linkage of proteins was observed, which is consistent with previous reports [52]–[55]. Moreover, compared to Gir2, which is an intrinsically unstructured protein, TRP47 is a mostly folded and ordered protein [56]. Thus, the abnormal migration of these acidic TRPs appears to be related to the presence of higher ratio of acidic (primarily Asp+Glu) to basic residues (Arg+Lys) as demonstrated by their near normal electrophoretic behavior after chemical modification of native and recombinant TRP47 with EDC [56]. It has been proposed that acidic domains have incomplete SDS binding [55], [56].In conclusion, the results of three independent analyses, experiments based on mass spectrometry and those based on immunoprecipitation and chemical modification, support the conclusion that the TR region of TRP47 is not glycosylated; however, the protein appears to be phosphorylated in the N-terminal region preceeding the TRs. A recent study [57] of several Borrelia burgdorferi proteins such as FlaA, FlaB, OspA, and OspB previously reported to be glycosylated found no evidence of glycosylation by mass spectrometric analysis. Some of the small mass difference observed for TRP47 and TRP32 could be attributed to carbamidomethylation of cysteine (C, 57 Da) and oxidation of methionine residue (M, 16 Da) during sample preparation. Bioinformatic analysis of Ehrlichia genomes has revealed no evidence of conserved glycosyltransferases, enzymes that catalyzes the transfer of an activated donor sugar to an appropriate acceptor, typically another sugar, lipid, protein or small molecule [36]–[38]. Still, we cannot rule out the possibility of the existence of a novel glycosyltransferase in the genome of E. chaffeensis. Moreover, others have reported glycosylation on outer membrane proteins (omp1/p28 and p44/msp2, respectively) of Ehrlichia and Anaplasma
[28], [33]–[35]. However, this study has defined the molecular basis for the anomalous electrophoretic migration of immunoreactive, acidic E. chaffeensis TRPs, and determined these proteins are not glycosylated.Cultivation of ehrlichiae was performed in DH82 cells as previously described [31]. Cell culture supernatant was collected from 95–100% E. chaffeensis (Arkansas)-infected DH82 cells maintained in serum-free media supplemented with 1% HEPES buffer, 1% sodium pyruvate and 1% non-essential amino acids at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Normal and E. chaffeensis-infected THP-1 cells were cultured as described [25]. The level of ehrlichial infection was assessed by Diff-Quik staining. The cell culture supernatant harvested was centrifuged at 10,000×g for 10 min, and was used immediately or frozen at −80°C until further use.For 2-DE sample preparation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with slight modifications. Briefly, the cell-free supernatant collected from E. chaffeensis-infected DH82 cells was concentrated 50 times using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-10 membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA.) and desalted with a Zeba spin column (Pierce, Rockford, IL). To 100 µl of desalted protein, 1 µl Tris Base (1 M, Biorad, Hercules, CA), 1 µl 100X Protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce), and 1 µl dithiothreitol (DTT 2 M, Sigma Chemical, Saint Louis, MI) were added, mixed and the pH was adjusted between 8.4–9.0. The sample was then treated with 100 units of Benzonase (Sigma) and 0.5 µl of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA, Sigma) each for 30 min at room temperature. The excess DMA was quenched by adding 1 µl DTT, and the mixture was centrifuged at 16,000×g for 20 min at 4°C.To 110 µg of protein sample (10 mg/ml), 128 µl of 1.1x ZOOM 2D protein solubilizer 1, 0.7 µl DTT (2 M), 0.3 µl Bio-Lyte 3/10 carrier ampholyte, and trace amounts of Bromophenol Blue were added, mixed and rehydrated onto a ZOOM strip (pH 3–10) for 1 h at room temperature. The protein on the strip was resolved in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the ZOOM IPGRunner mini-cell following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) at 4000 Vh. Following focusing, ZOOM strips were equilibrated in 10 ml of buffer containing 1X NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and 1X NuPAGE sample reducing agent, and then equilibrated in 10 ml of 1X NuPAGE LDS sample buffer with 125 mM iodoacetamide sequentially for 15 min each. After equilibration, the IPG strips were transferred to the top of a 4–12% Bis-Tris Zoom SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel (Invitrogen) and overlaid with 0.5% agarose in Laemmli buffer for second-dimension SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis, proteins were detected with ProteoSilver Plus Silver Stain Kit (Sigma), Zinc Stain (Biorad, Hercules, CA), or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and detected with antibodies specific for TRP32, TRP47, TRP120 or E. chaffeensis as previously described [8], [9], [44].For recombinant TRP47, in-frame GST fusion proteins for full-length TRP47, amino (N)-terminal (TRP471–380) and carboxy (C)-terminal (TRP47361–842) TRP47 were generated by PCR, amplifying the corresponding coding regions from E. chaffeensis Arkansas genomic DNA using custom synthesized oligonucleotide primers [25]. pGEX-6P-1 plasmids encoding the GST-TRP47, GST-TRP471–380 (GST-NterTRP47), and GST-TRP47361–842 (GST-CterTRP47) fusion proteins were transformed into BL21 strain of Escherichia coli (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ). Protein expression and purification were performed according to the procedures outlined in the Bulk GST Purification Module (GE Healthcare).The protein of interest was excised from the 2-DE gel with a clean scalpel and placed into a microcentrifuge tube and destained following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the gel slices were cut into equal 1 mm pieces, and proteins were electroeluted in volatile buffer (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 0.025% SDS) using D-Tube Dialyzers (Novagen-EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). The eluted protein was desalted and concentrated using Amicon-Ultra 4 (Millipore), and the amount and purity was verified by Coomassie staining and Western immunoblotting using TRP47- and TRP32-specific serum before proceeding for mass spectrometry analysis. For in-gel digestion of protein isolated by 2-DE, the proteins of interest were excised from the gel, destained, and digested with trypsin (Sigma) and Asp-N endoproteinase (Sigma) following the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). After digestion, the samples were removed from the incubator, and 1 µl of sample solution was spotted directly onto a MALDI target plate and allowed to air dry. 1 µl of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (for digested peptides) or sinapic acid (for undigested protein) (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) matrix solution (50∶50 acetonitrile/water at 5 mg/mL) was then applied on the sample spot and allowed to dry. The dried MALDI spot was blown with compressed air (Decon Laboratories, King of Prussia, PA) before inserting into the mass spectrometer. To detect phosphopeptide, enrichment from protein digests was performed using a phosphopeptide isolation kit (Pierce) and the samples were analyzed by electrospray (ESI) LC-MS and MALDI-TOF spectrometers following the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce).Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF-MS) was used to analyze the mass of the native TRP47, TRP32 and recombinant TRP47 as previously described [44]. Data were acquired with an Applied Biosystems 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF Proteomic Analyzer. Applied Biosystems software packages including 4000 Series Explorer (v3.6 RC1) with Oracle Database Schema Version (v3.19.0) and Data Version (3.80.0) were used to acquire both MS and MS/MS data. The instrument was operated in positive ion linear mode, with mass range as required. A total 4,000 laser shots were acquired and averaged from each sample spot. External calibration was performed using cytochrome c or bovine serum albumin according to the target molecular weight. MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry was performed for peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) as described [58] with some modifications. The instrument was operated in positive ion reflectron mode in 850–3,000 Da mass range, and the focus mass was set at 1,700 Da. For MS data, 2,000–4,000 laser shots were acquired and averaged from each sample spot. Automatic external calibration was performed using a peptide mixture with reference masses 904.468, 1296.685, 1570.677, and 2465.199 Da. Following MALDI MS analysis, MALDI MS/MS was performed on several (5–10) abundant ions from each sample spot. A 1 kV positive ion MS/MS method was used to acquire data under post-source decay (PSD) conditions with precursor selection window set at +/− 3 Da. For MS/MS data, 2,000 laser shots were acquired and averaged from each sample spot. Automatic external calibration was performed using reference fragment molecular masses 175.120, 480.257, 684.347, 1056.475, and 1441.635 (from precursor mass 1570.677). Alpha- casein digested with trypsin was used as control for phophopeptide identification. Applied Biosystems GPS Explorer (v3.6) software was used in conjunction with MASCOT to search the respective protein database (NCBI) using both MS and MS/MS spectral data for protein identification. Protein match probabilities were determined using expectation values and/or MASCOT protein scores. MS peak filtering included the following parameters, mass range 800–4,000 Da, minimum S/N filter 10, mass exclusion list tolerance 0.5 Da, and mass exclusion list included 842.51, 870.45, 1045.56, 1179.60, 1277.71, 1475.79, and 2211.10 (trypsin and keratin fragments). Other parameters included were the following: selecting enzyme as trypsin or Asp-N; maximum missed cleavages  = 1; fixed modifications included carbamidomethyl (C); variable modifications included oxidation (M); precursor tolerance set at 0.2 Da; MS/MS fragment tolerance set at 0.3 Da; mass  =  monoisotopic; and peptide charges were only considered as +1. The significance of a protein match based on both the PMF in the first MS and the MS/MS from several precursor ions, is based on expectation values. The default significance threshold was p<0.05. A more stringent threshold of 0.001 was used for protein identification.Rabbit anti-TRP47, -TRP32, and -TRP120 antibodies were produced to KLH-conjugated peptides representing major continuous epitopes as previously described [8], [9], [44]. Convalescent-phase anti-E. chaffeensis dog serum was obtained from an experimentally infected dog (no. 2251) [8]. Other antibodies used in this study were mouse anti-pTyr (PY99) and normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).Immunoprecipitation was performed as described [25] with modifications. Briefly, 107 normal and E. chaffeensis-infected THP-1 cells were collected (500×g, 5 min), washed twice in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Pierce) that contained complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), phosphatase inhibitors cocktail (Pierce), 5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride and incubated for 20 min on ice. Cell lysates were prepared by sonication of cells for 1 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000×g for 10 min at 4°C. Preclearing of the lysate was performed by incubation with 50 µl of protein A/G sepharose 50% slurry (Pierce) and 20 µl of normal mouse IgG agarose-conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4°C. The lysate was centrifuged briefly, and supernatant was collected. The supernatants containing 500 µg of protein (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 5 µg of either agarose-conjugated mouse anti-pTyr monoclonal antibody or normal mouse IgG with gentle mixing for 16 h at 4°C. The beads were centrifuged briefly for 30 sec at 1,000×g, and then washed three times with lysis buffer and once with PBS before boiling for 5 min in 30 µl of 2x LDS sample buffer with 1x sample reducing agent (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membrane was blocked in 5% phosphoblocker (Cell Biolabs) in Tris buffered saline with 0.5% Tween (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-pTyr or rabbit anti-TRP47 antibody. Bound primary antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G [IgG(H+L)] secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and visualized after incubation with BCIP/NBT (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate–nitroblue tetrazolium) substrate or with TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) membrane peroxidase substrate (KPL).Native TRP47 was purified from the cell-free supernatant collected from E. chaffeensis-infected DH82 cells as previously described [8], except that cell culture supernatants were centrifuged twice (500×g for 5 min and 10,000×g for 10 min) to pellet cells and bacteria. The cell culture supernatants were separated by gel electrophoresis and TRP47 was excised from the gel, electroeluted, concentrated and finally resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). To 500 µg/ml of GST-only, GST-TRP47, GST-NterTRP47, and GST-CterTRP47 fusion proteins, 0.5 M ethanolamine, 30 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer, and 12 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) were added to final concentration, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of LDS sample buffer with sample reducing agent (Invitrogen).We are grateful to Robert English at Biomolecular Resource Facility Mass Spectrometry Core at University of Texas Medical Branch for assistance with mass spectrometry and David H.

PMC2838879,GASdb: a large-scale and comparative exploration database of glycosyl hydrolysis systems,False,"The genomes of numerous cellulolytic organisms have been recently sequenced or in the pipeline of being sequenced. Analyses of these genomes as well as the recently sequenced metagenomes in a systematic manner could possibly lead to discoveries of novel biomass-degradation systems in nature.We have identified 4,679 and 49,099 free acting glycosyl hydrolases with or without carbohydrate binding domains, respectively, by scanning through all the proteins in the UniProt Knowledgebase and the JGI Metagenome database. Cellulosome components were observed only in bacterial genomes, and 166 cellulosome-dependent glycosyl hydrolases were identified. We observed, from our analysis data, unexpected wide distributions of two less well-studied bacterial glycosyl hydrolysis systems in which glycosyl hydrolases may bind to the cell surface directly rather than through linking to surface anchoring proteins, or cellulosome complexes may bind to the cell surface by novel mechanisms other than the other used SLH domains. In addition, we found that animal-gut metagenomes are substantially enriched with novel glycosyl hydrolases.The identified biomass degradation systems through our large-scale search are organized into an easy-to-use database GASdb at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~ffzhou/GASdb/, which should be useful to both experimental and computational biofuel researchers.As a promising alternative energy source to fossil fuels, biofuels can be produced through degradation and fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass of plant cell walls [1,2]. A key challenge in converting biomass to fuels lies in the special structures of cell walls that plants have formed during evolution to resist decomposition from microbes and enzymes. It is this defense system of plants that makes their conversion to fuel difficult, which is known as the biomass recalcitrance problem [3]. Considerable efforts have been invested into searches for microbes, specifically cellulolytic microbes, which can effectively break down this defense system in plants.Cellulolytic microbes degrade biomass through secreting glycosyl hydrolases, binding to the biomass using their carbohydrate binding domains (CBMs), and then cutting various chemical bonds of the biomass using their catalytic domains [4]. It has been observed that the catalytic efficiency of a glycosyl hydrolase (WGH) decreases when it does not have a CBM domain [5,6], compared to the ones with such a domain. While some microbes use directly multiple glycosyl hydrolases, independent of each other, for biomass degradation, other microbes use them in an organized fashion, i.e., orchestrating them into large protein complexes, called cellulosomes, through scaffolding (Sca) proteins. The former are called free acting hydrolases (FAC), and the latter called cellulosome dependent hydrolases (CDC) [4,7]. Some anaerobic microbes use both systems for biomass degradation [7] while most of the other cellulolytic microbes use only one of them. When degrading biomasses, cellulosomes are generally attached to their host cell surfaces by binding to the cell surface anchoring (SLH) proteins [8]. The general observation has been that cellulosomes are more efficient in degradation of biomass into short-chain sugars than free acting cellulases [8]. Our goal in this computational study is to identify and characterize all the component proteins of the biomass degradation system in an organism, which is called the glydrome of the organism.We have systematically re-annotated and analyzed the functional domains and signal peptides of all the proteins in the UniProt Knowledgebase and the JGI Metagenome database, aiming to identify novel glycosyl hydrolases or novel mechanisms for biomass degradation. Based on their domain compositions, we have classified all the identified glydrome components into five categories, namely FAC, WGH, CDC, SLH and Sca. To our surprise, two less well-studied glycosyl hydrolysis systems were found to be widely distributed in 63 bacterial genomes, in which (a) glycosyl hydrolases may bind directly to the cell surfaces by their own cell surface anchoring domains rather than through those in the cell surface anchoring proteins or (b) cellulosome complexes may bind to the cell surface through novel mechanisms other than the SLH domains, respectively, as previously observed. Our analyses also suggest that animal-gut metagenomes are significantly enriched with novel glycosyl hydrolases. All the identified glydrome elements are organized into an easy-to-use database, GASdb, at http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~ffzhou/GASdb/.We downloaded the UniProt Knowledgebase release 14.8 (Feb 10, 2009) [9] with 7,754,276 proteins, and all the 46 metagenomes from the JGI IMG/M database [10] with 1,504,133 proteins. The three simulated metagenomes in the database were excluded from our analysis.The operon annotations were downloaded from DOOR [11,12].We have identified the signal peptides and analyzed the functional domains for all the proteins using SignalP version 3.0 [13,14] and Pfam version 23.0 [15]. A protein is defined as a cell surface anchoring protein, if it has one SLH domain and one Cohesin domain; a scaffolding has at least three Cohesin domains or one Cohesin domain and one carbohydrate binding domain; a cellulosome dependent catalytic protein has one catalytic domain and one dockerin domain; a free acting catalytic protein has one catalytic domain and one CBM domain; and all the other proteins with one catalytic domain are defined as weak catalytic proteins.We calculated the percentages of glydrome components in genomes with at least 1,000 proteins only, since most of the others may not have completely sequenced. Three dimension protein structures were predicted using LOMETS [16]. The protein's Gene Ontology annotations were predicted using PFP [17].To make the annotated glydromes easy to be accessed, a database GASdb was constructed using PHP scripting language.4,616 FACs are identified from the 7.75 million proteins in the UniProt Knowledgebase (release 14.8) [see Additional file 1]. The majority of them, 2,774 (61.71%), are from bacterial genomes. 1,019 FACs are found in the phylum Firmicutes, of which are a number of well-studied cellulolytic organisms such as Anaerocellum thermophilum [18], Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus [19] and Clostridium thermocellum [20,21]. In addition, a large number of FACs are found in each of the two other phyla, namely Bacteroidetes (342 FACs) and Actinobacteria (425 FACs). Overall, these three phyla harbour 64.38% (~1,786/2,774) of our identified bacterial FACs, comparing to 25.12% of all the bacterial genomes covered by these phyla.The previous observation has been that a functional cellulosome consists of at least one cell surface anchoring protein with SLH domains, at least one scaffolding protein and a number of cellulosome dependent glycosyl hydrolases [3,8,22,23]. Our search and analysis results indicate that novel biomass-degradation mechanisms may exist in the genomes or metagenomes that we analyzed, the details of which will need further studies. For example, Clostridium acetobutylicum was known to encode a scaffolding protein and a few cellulosome dependent enzymes, but it is not clear how the cellulosome is anchored to the cell surface [24,25] as no SLH domains were identified in the genome [see Additional file 1]. The similar question holds for the other four Firmicutes, i.e. Clostridium cellulolyticum, Clostridium cellulovorans, Clostridium josui and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. We did not expect that the scaffolding proteins in all these genomes except for Ruminococcus flavefaciens encode a domain of unknown function (PF03442: DUF291). Our data supports the previous observation that the four DUF291 domains in the C. cellulovorans scaffolding CbpA are possibly involved in anchoring the cellulosome on the cell surface [26].A somewhat unusual glydrome was identified in Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 of phylum Firmicutes. Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 was known to encode modular xylanases [27,28] as shown in Figure ​Figure1.1. It is surprising to find 4 SLH proteins, i.e. B1D7Q9, B1D969, B1DGS5 and B1DIS9, but no other cellulosome components in Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2. Our search did not find any dockerin domains in the genome, suggesting the possibility that the organism uses an unknown biomass-degradation mechanism. In addition our search also identified SLH domains in 6 FACs and 5 WGHs of this organism, as shown in Figure ​Figure1.1. The superfamily of Ig-like fold domains are found in varieties of cell surface proteins [29], and the existence of them (Big_2, Big_4, and fn3, etc) in the aforementioned proteins further supports that they may anchor to the cell surface.Domain structures of four SLH proteins and eleven glycosyl hydrolases with SLH domains in Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2.Overall a large number of glycosyl hydrolases without carbohydrate binding domains or dockerin domains were identified in the bacterial genomes. More than 2,000 WGHs are found in each of the following four phyla, Proteobacteria (10,442 WGHs), Firmicutes (6,084 WGHs), Bacteroidetes (2,885 WGHs) and Actinobacteria (2,371 WGHs). Top 3 bacterial genomes with the highest percentages of glycosyl hydrolases (FACs, WGHs and CDCs) are Bacteroides intestinalis DSM 17393 (5.11%), Bacteroides ovatus ATCC 8483 (4.49%) and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (4.40%).18 FACs are identified in six genera of Archaea, i.e. Thermococcus, Halobacterium, Pyrococcus, Thermofilum, Caldivirga and Haloferax [see Additional file 1], covering 11 genomes. Each of these 11 archaeal genomes encodes 1-3 FACs together with up to 28 WGHs. FACs were known to be encoded in four archaeal genomes, i.e. Halobacterium mediterranei [30], Pyrococcus furiosus [31,32], Pyrococcus kodakaraensis [33] and Ferroplasma acidiphilum strain Y [34]. Three of them are in our list. The glycosyl hydrolase in Ferroplasma acidiphilum strain Y was missed in our database since our annotation is based on the knowledge from the two databases, CAZy [35] and Pfam [15], neither of which includes this enzyme. 14 of the 18 identified FACs are homologous to each other with NCBI BLAST E-values < 1e-132 in different species of the same genus, suggesting that these enzymes have been in the 11 archaeal genomes at least before the divergence of these species.385 proteins are annotated as WGHs in the 93 genomes from 30 archaeal genera. No cellulosome components were found in any of the archaeal genomes.1,824 FACs are found in the 1,668 eukaryotic genomes covering 23 phyla, 62.23% (1,135/1,824) of which were from fungal genomes. A green plant phylum Streptophyta (664 FACs) contributes to 36.40% of the FACs. All the other phyla encode less than 100 FACs. Four plant genomes encode more than 45 FACs, and they are Oryza sativa sp japonica (Rice) (99 FACs), Vitis vinifera (Grape) (71 FACs), Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) (65 FACs) and Zea mays (Maize) (47 FACs). The other 25 non-fungi FACs are encoded in 5 unicellular algae and 6 animal genomes.17,048 WGHs are found in the 1,668 eukaryotic genomes. The top three phyla in the numbers of FACs are also top three in the numbers of WGHs; and 2,328, 5,444 and 5,171 WGHs are encoded in three phyla Arthropoda, Ascomycota and Streptophyta, respectively. The top four eukaryotic genomes in the numbers of WGHs are from the phylum Streptophyta, and they are Oryza sativa sp japonica (Rice) (828 WGHs), Arabidopsis thaliana (Mouse-ear cress) (678 WGHs), Vitis vinifera (Grape) (602 WGHs) and Zea mays (Maize) (284 WGHs).It is interesting to observe that there are 272 and 224 WGHs in the human and mouse genomes, respectively. Besides two other plant genomes, i.e. Oryza sativa subsp. indica (Rice) (258 WGHs) and Physcomitrella patens sp patens (Moss) (226 WGHs), all the other 6 eukaryotic genomes encoding more than 200 WGHs are from the fungal phylum Ascomycota. No cellulosome components were identified in the eukaryotic genomes. 200 (~73.53%) human WGHs are homologous to mouse WGHs with NCBI BLAST E-values < e-23. So the majority of these enzymes have been in the genomes of human and mouse at least before their divergence 75 million years ago [36].Overall, 63 FACs and 6,072 WGHs are found in 42 metagenomes except for TM7b which was sampled from the human mouth. The top two metagenomes in the numbers of glycosyl hydrolases are from termite guts (12 FACs and 1,150 WGHs) and diversa silage soil (13 FACs and 820 WGHs). Since the number of proteins in metagenomes varies from 452 in termite gut fosmids to 185,274 in the diversa silage soil, we calculated the percentage of the glycosyl hydrolases in each metagenome. On average, 0.65% of a metagenome encode glycosyl hydrolases. We noted that all the metagenomes with more than 1% encoding glycosyl hydrolases are from the animal guts (including human, mouse and termite). This is confirmed by an independent study using BLAST mapping [37]. No cellulosome components were identified in any metagenome.All the annotated glydromes were organized into an easy-to-use database GASdb (Figure ​(Figure2).2). A user can find the proteins of interest through browsing, and searching using keywords or BLAST. The overall organization of each glydrome can be displayed; and the high resolution images of each protein can be downloaded for the publication purpose, as shown in Figure ​Figure3.3. A user can also display the signal peptide and functional domains of a given protein and its homologs using BLAST with E-value cutoff 1e-20, as shown in Figure ​Figure33.The database interfaces: the main page, the browsing page, the searching page, and the BLAST page.The displaying pages for the domain architectures of the glydrome of Clostridium acetobutylicum, and domain architectures of the protein Clostridium acetobutylicum CelA and its homolog.The glydromes of multiple genomes can be illustrated in the Compare interface. First, the user needs to find the genome(s) of interest using keywords through the Compare interface. Then one or multiple genomes can be selected from the left panel in Figure ​Figure4,4, and added to the right panel for final display. The user can also remove some genomes from the right panel. The signal peptides and functional domains of proteins in the selected glydromes in the right panel will be displayed in the next page by clicking the Compare button, as shown in Figure ​Figure44.The comparative analyzing interface of GASdb with Vitis pseudoreticulata and Ziziphus mauritiana as an example.The majority (52.90%) of glycosyl hydrolases (including FACs, CDCs and WGHs) in our database are encoded by the 1,771 bacterial genomes. The 1,668 eukaryotic genomes contribute 34.98% of the total glycosyl hydrolases. So the glycosyl hydrolases are much more enriched in bacteria than in eukaryotes, considering the substantially larger sizes of eukaryotic genomes. Cellulosome components are observed only in Firmicutes, except for the CDC xynB ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q7UF11"",""term_id"":""81657820"",""term_text"":""Q7UF11""}}Q7UF11) from Rhodopirellula baltica. All the other glycosyl hydrolases do not have dockerin domains, and were annotated as FACs or WGHs. Although the catalytic domain and the CBM domain of a glycosyl hydrolase can function independently, the CBM domain is known to play an important role in the catalytic efficiency of glycosyl hydrolase [5,6]. So the annotated FACs may have higher catalytic efficiency.A cell surface anchoring protein binds to the cell surface through its two or three SLH domains, and binds to the cellulosome scaffolding proteins together with the CDCs through the interacting pairs of cohesin domains and dockerin domains. It is unexpected to find SLH domains in additional 5 FACs and 5 WGHs of Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2, as the only previous observation related to this is {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q53I45"",""term_id"":""75504488"",""term_text"":""Q53I45""}}Q53I45 (XynA) in Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 genome [28]. We believe that these glycosyl hydrolases may bind to the cell surface through their own SLH domains, as Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 encodes SLH proteins but no scaffoldings or CDCs. It would be interesting to study how Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2 acquired the SLH proteins or lost the other cellulosome components. We noticed that this is not a unique feature of Paenibacillus sp. JDR-2, as there are 26 FACs and 52 WGHs with SLH domains in the other organisms, all of which are bacteria, except for the moss Physcomitrella patens. Many of these enzymes have been experimentally confirmed to anchor on the cell surfaces through the SLH domains, e.g. the cell surface xylanase xyn5 ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q8GHJ4"",""term_id"":""75526284"",""term_text"":""Q8GHJ4""}}Q8GHJ4) from Paenibacillus sp.

Five Firmicutes encode scaffolding proteins and CDCs but no recognizable SLH domains, a key feature for the cell surface anchoring proteins. The cellulosomes were observed to anchor on the cell surfaces in Clostridium cellulolyticum [22], Clostridium cellulovorans [42] and Ruminococcus flavefaciens [7]. But the detailed mechanisms remain to be known. The cellulosomes in Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium josui may also be linked to the cell surfaces through some unknown mechanisms. Our analysis suggests that the domain of unknown function DUF291 (PF03442) might be involved in attaching these cellulosomes to the cell surfaces. We predicted the 3D structure of the first DUF291 domain in the scaffolding {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q977Y4"",""term_id"":""81529105"",""term_text"":""Q977Y4""}}Q977Y4 of the Clostridium acetobutylicum glydrome, as shown in Figure ​Figure5.5. The first template (1EHX) does not show functional implication, while the second one (1CS6) is involved in cell adhesion [43,44]. The difference between the two predicted structures of the DUF291 domain is similar to each other with RMSD~2.7 A and TM score 0.6 using TM-align [45,46].Top two predicted structures of the first DUF291 (PF03442) domain of the scaffolding {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q977Y4"",""term_id"":""81529105"",""term_text"":""Q977Y4""}}Q977Y4 of the Clostridium acetobutylicum glydrome, with templates 1ehxa and 1cs6a, respectively.We collected 41 proteins encoded in the same operons with the components of Clostridium acetobutylicum glydrome but not in our GASdb. 16 of these proteins cover the following functional categories: binding (GO:0005488), catalytic activity (GO:0003824) and transporter activity (GO:0005215), and the remaining 25 are hypothetical or uncharacterized proteins. Only five proteins were annotated to be involved in the glycosyl hydrolysis, e.g. carbohydrate binding (GO:0030246) or hydrolase activity (GO:0016787). Three of the five proteins missed in our GASdb, i.e. {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q97EZ1"",""term_id"":""81595901"",""term_text"":""Q97EZ1""}}Q97EZ1, {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q97FI9"",""term_id"":""81854786"",""term_text"":""Q97FI9""}}Q97FI9 and {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q97TI3"",""term_id"":""81620533"",""term_text"":""Q97TI3""}}Q97TI3, do not have recognizable Pfam domains related to the glycosyl hydrolysis. {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q97TP4"",""term_id"":""81532550"",""term_text"":""Q97TP4""}}Q97TP4 is annotated to be an esterase (family 4 CE).

However the majority of the annotated glycosyl hydrolases do not have any signal peptides, based on the predictions of SignalP 3.0 [13,14]. We found that over 65% of WGHs across all organisms except for Eukaryota do not have predicted signal peptides suggesting the possibility of these proteins using a novel secretion mechanism.The ratio between the numbers of WGHs and FACs in a glydrome tends to be no more than 30. We calculated this ratio for each glydrome in a genome or metagenome with at least 1,000 proteins and at least one FAC and one WGH. We observed that the averaged ratios between the numbers of WGHs and FACs are 9.98, 12.55 and 14.40 for archaea, bacteria and eukaryota, with standard derivations 8.22, 16.65 and 12.25, respectively. Overall, over 90% of the glydromes in archaea, bacteria and eukaryota are lower than 30 in this ratio, respectively. It is surprising to find that the metagenomes encode 95.38 times more WGHs than FACs but no cellulosome components. We speculate that there may be some novel CBM domains being used by these WGHs in these metagenomes. An alternative hypothesis could be that microbes in a community generously secrete WGHs to degrade biomass and live on the hydrolysis products in the nearby regions only.We conducted the first large-scale annotation of glydromes in all the sequenced genomes and metagenomes. We have made a number of interesting observations about glydromes of the sequences genomes and metagenomes. Among them, two less well-studied glydromes were observed in dozens of organisms, which are A) glycosyl hydrolases were found to have cell surface anchoring domains and can bind to the cell surfaces by themselves; and B) Clostridium acetobutylicum and four other bacteria from the phylum Firmicutes encode all cellulosome components except for the cell surface anchoring proteins SLHs, suggesting that the cellulosomes may have link to the cell surfaces through some novel mechanisms. Individual cases have been experimentally observed, but further studies are needed to uncover the underlining mechanisms and how they evolved into the current glydrome structures. Our data also suggested that the animal gut metagenomes are rich in novel glycosyl hydrolases, providing new targets for further experimental studies.Project name: GASdb;Project home page: http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~ffzhou/GASdb/;Operating systems: Platform independent;Programming language: Perl, PHP, ApacheLicense: none;Restrictions to use by non-academics: none.YX wrote and polished the manuscript, and served as the principle investigator of the project.

PMC2843956,Synthetic biology and biomass conversion: a match made in heaven?,False,"To move our economy onto a sustainable basis, it is essential that we find a replacement for fossil carbon as a source of liquid fuels and chemical industry feedstocks. Lignocellulosic biomass, available in enormous quantities, is the only feasible replacement. Many micro-organisms are capable of rapid and efficient degradation of biomass, employing a battery of specialized enzymes, but do not produce useful products. Attempts to transfer biomass-degrading capability to industrially useful organisms by heterologous expression of one or a few biomass-degrading enzymes have met with limited success. It seems probable that an effective biomass-degradation system requires the synergistic action of a large number of enzymes, the individual and collective actions of which are poorly understood. By offering the ability to combine any number of transgenes in a modular, combinatorial way, synthetic biology offers a new approach to elucidating the synergistic action of combinations of biomass-degrading enzymes in vivo and may ultimately lead to a transferable biomass-degradation system. Also, synthetic biology offers the potential for assembly of novel product-formation pathways, as well as mechanisms for increased solvent tolerance. Thus, synthetic biology may finally lead to cheap and effective processes for conversion of biomass to useful products.Owing to the twin factors of declining oil reserves and increasing concern about rising carbon dioxide levels, our society must urgently seek a replacement for fossil fuels. The enormous quantities of coal, oil and gas that are used for the generation of electricity may ultimately be partially or completely replaced by other sources such as nuclear, solar-electric, solar-thermal, hydroelectric, geothermal, tidal, wave and ocean-thermal power systems. Considerable attention has also been directed to the development of electric vehicles, which may replace petrol-driven cars for short journeys. However, barring enormous improvements in battery technology, it seems unlikely that liquid fuels can be replaced in the near future for long-distance road transport, sea transport or, most particularly, aviation, which are essential for the efficient global movement of goods and people, and thus critical to the functioning of the modern world. Also, quite apart from energy uses, around 6–10 per cent of fossil fuels recovered are currently directed to the petrochemical industry (Waltz 2008), leading to a wide range of products essential to our way of life. Alternative sources of suitable molecules for these applications are urgently required. Plant-derived material is the only feasible renewable source.A great deal of work has gone into the development of biofuels (Antoni et al. 2007; Dale 2008). The majority of effort is associated with bioethanol and biodiesel. Ethanol for biofuel use is produced on a large scale by fermentation using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The major producers of bioethanol are Brazil and the USA. In Brazil, ethanol is derived from sucrose in sugarcane; in the USA, it is produced mainly from glucose syrup derived from maize (corn) starch, a procedure that is generally held to be less environmentally favourable than the sugarcane-based process owing to the high-energy inputs involved (Goldemberg 2007; Granda et al. 2007). Biodiesel is produced by esterification of fatty acids derived from vegetable oils (Hill et al. 2006; Granda et al. 2007). It has been suggested that the CO2 emissions generated by land clearance for growing biofuel crops may outweigh the reduction in emissions associated with reduced use of fossil fuels (Fargione et al. 2008; Gallagher et al. 2008; Searchinger et al. 2008). It also seems clear that production of biofuels from maize and vegetable oils is creating unacceptable competition with food, both by diverting food-grade materials and by absorbing land that could be used for growing food crops. This is considered to be one factor in the major rises in staple food prices seen in early 2008, leading to food riots in many parts of the world (Sachs 2008), though the extent to which biofuel production competes with food production has been questioned (e.g. Dale 2008). Nevertheless, it seems clear that there is limited scope for increased production of biofuels by these methods. This has led to great interest in ‘second generation’ biofuels, derived from non-food materials, particularly lignocellulosic biomass, the non-edible parts of plants (Lynd et al. 2005; Chang 2007; Kumar et al. 2008; Wackett 2008; Yuan et al. 2008). Potential sources of such material include agricultural and timber industry waste, waste paper and purpose-grown plant material derived from rapidly growing non-food plants such as scrub willow, switchgrass and Miscanthus, which can be grown on land unsuited to food production (Heaton et al. 2008). Since all plants consist largely of this material, in principle any plant material could be used, including mixed grasses harvested sustainably from prairie-style systems, thus avoiding the environmental issues associated with intensive monocultures.Processes must therefore be developed for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into useful products. The Ideal Biofuel Producing Micro-organism (IBPM) must possess a number of independent characteristics:
it must be able to hydrolyse cellulosic material effectively, with minimal requirement for pre-processing;it must be able to convert the sugars released into molecules useful as liquid fuels and/or chemical industry feedstocks;it must be able to produce these molecules at a high concentration without poisoning itself, in order to minimize downstream processing costs; andit must be capable of rapid growth in a bioreactor and suitable in other respects for use in an industrial context.Naturally occurring micro-organisms do not fulfil these criteria. Here we will consider how the emerging discipline of synthetic biology might be applied to develop a new organism, which can be applied in such a process.Synthetic biology aims to construct novel biological systems from smaller components. This programme is exemplified in the concept of BioBricks (Knight 2003; Registry of Standard Biological Parts 2009): modular, interchangeable DNA components, which, due to the use of a combination of restriction sites generating compatible and incompatible sticky ends, can be assembled in any order and in any desired number to generate complex multi-gene systems, which can be further combined to any desired degree (figure 1). The original BioBrick standard is now under revision (BioBricks Foundation; www.biobricks.org), but any successor standards will certainly maintain the key principles of modularity and interchangeability. Ultimately, the decreasing cost of synthetic DNA should further simplify the assembly of complex multi-gene systems. The unprecedented flexibility offered by BioBricks and other synthetic biology approaches has tremendous potential for allowing the generation of new micro-organisms combining useful phenotypes from different sources. It is this technology that may finally allow us to generate the IBPM and make conversion of biomass to fuels and chemical feedstocks an economically competitive process.The BioBrick 1.0 assembly standard (Knight 2003; Registry of Standard Biological Parts 2009). (a) Each BioBrick is a length of DNA bearing a genetic component such as an open reading frame, ribosome-binding site, promoter, transcription termination sequence or any combination of these. Each BioBrick possesses EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites at the 5′ end, and SpeI and PstI sites at the 3′ end. (b) Standard prefix and suffix sequences for BioBricks. The six-base pair recognition sites for each restriction endonuclease are shown in bold and dashed lines indicate the staggered cuts made by each enzyme. (c) Ligation of an SpeI-cut end to an XbaI-cut end generates a six-base pair ‘scar’, which is not recognized by either XbaI or SpeI. (d) By appropriate choice of restriction enzymes, any BioBrick can be inserted either upstream or downstream of any other BioBrick. (e) In either case, the product, bearing both components, is also a BioBrick, bearing the same four restriction sites as the original component BioBricks. It can thus be added either upstream or downstream of any other BioBrick. In this way large and complex constructs can be built up quickly and easily from a library of standard parts.In synthetic biology, the characteristic of robust growth in a bioreactor context is ensured by choice of an appropriate host or ‘chassis’ organism, such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis or S. cerevisiae, which provides background processes to support the new pathways to be introduced. The problem then becomes one of generating the new biological modules: biomass degradation, product formation and solvent tolerance. In the remainder of this paper, we will consider how synthetic biology can contribute to each of these aspects and, finally, can help to bring them all together in one organism, the IBPM.Of all the characteristics required for the IBPM, biomass degradation is perhaps that which has absorbed the greatest amount of research. While a great deal has been learned about the nature of microbial biomass degradation systems, efforts to transfer such systems to heterologous hosts have not been completely successful, though some progress has been made (Lynd et al. 2002, 2005; Kumar et al. 2008). Biomass degradation presents unique difficulties, which synthetic biology seems well placed to solve.Biomass consists mainly of long cellulose fibres embedded in an amorphous matrix of hemicellulose and lignin (Glazer & Nikaido 1995; Reid 1997; Lynd et al. 2002). The cellulose fibres consist of long chains (of the order of thousands of residues) of β-(1,4)-linked d-glucose residues, with alternating orientation so that the repeating unit is cellobiose (glucose-β-1,4-glucopyranoside). Cellulose chains are tightly packed together with insoluble hydrogen-bonded crystalline regions alternating with amorphous regions. This provides a high degree of tensile strength. Hemicelluloses are shorter molecules consisting of a mixture of monomers including d-xylose, l-arabinose, d-mannose and d-galactose, as well as sugar derivatives such as 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronic acid. Lignin is a complex three-dimensional polymer formed by polymerization of aromatic monomers and forms a matrix around the fibres. In principle, cellulose can be hydrolysed to release d-glucose, a suitable carbon source for the growth of micro-organisms, which could be used to produce biofuels and chemical feedstocks. However, enzymic or non-enzymic hydrolysis of cellulosic material to its component sugars is rendered difficult by the insoluble nature of the crystalline regions and the presence of lignin. Even following pre-treatment to disrupt lignin, cellulose hydrolysis is difficult and expensive, meaning that, despite its abundance, cellulose is not an economically competitive source of glucose compared to starch. Hemicellulose can be hydrolysed relatively easily, by either enzymic or non-enzymic processes, but its monomer sugars are not efficiently used by most industrially useful organisms. Lignin degradation is a more complex issue. Generally speaking, lignin is a problem in recovery of sugars from cellulosic material, and chemical and/or mechanical pre-treatment is required to disrupt lignin before hydrolysis. Another application of genetic modification and synthetic biology, which will not be discussed in this report, concerns the development of plants with reduced lignin content or altered lignin structure (Weng et al. 2008). Interestingly, Sarath et al. (2008) have pointed out that, in the case of forage crops, such as sorghum and switchgrass, varieties have already been bred with altered lignin content for increased digestability by animals, and these may also be useful in biofuel production.Despite these issues, some bacteria and fungi are capable of rapid and efficient degradation of cellulose (Lynd et al. 2002). The ability to degrade amorphous cellulose, soluble cellulose analogues, such as carboxymethyl cellulose, and hemicellulose-like substrates is relatively widespread, but the ability to degrade crystalline cellulose is relatively uncommon and seems to be mainly restricted to specialized cellulose-degrading micro-organisms (Coughlan & Mayer 1992). In view of the high abundance and recalcitrance of cellulose, it is perhaps not surprising that certain micro-organisms should come to specialize in its degradation, as it offers an abundant source of carbon for which there is relatively little competition. Among cultured bacteria, efficient degradation of crystalline cellulose is mainly associated with the anaerobic spore-forming low-GC Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Clostridium, the aerobic high-GC Gram-positive bacteria Cellulomonas and some of the streptomycetes, the anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria of the Fibrobacter group, the aerobic Gram-negative gliding bacteria Cytophaga and some of the myxobacteria, and a few other groups. Fungal cellulose degraders occur in both the ascomycetes (soft rot fungi) and basidiomycetes (white and brown rot fungi). Lignin degradation has been best studied in the white rot fungi such as Phanaerochaete chrysosporium (Glazer & Nikaido 1995).Cellulose degradation systems have been studied in a variety of organisms including certain fungi (especially Trichoderma, the source of the majority of commercial cellulase preparations), the aerobic bacterium Cellulomonas fimi and the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum, as well as close relatives of these organisms. This has led to a paradigmatic view of cellulose degradation (figure 2), in which cellulose fibres are initially attacked by endoglucanases, which break random bonds in the chains to reveal free reducing and non-reducing ends. These are then attacked by exoglucanases, which move processively along the chain from either the reducing or non-reducing end, releasing cellobiose, or, in some cases, glucose or cellotetraose; exoglucanases that release cellobiose are also known as cellobiohydrolases. Cellobiose is then hydrolysed by β-glucosidases, avoiding a buildup of cellobiose, which would lead to inhibition of exoglucanases. All of these processes must operate simultaneously for effective cellulose degradation. Multiple families of enzymes with each of these classes of activity are known (Lynd et al. 2002; Cantarel et al. 2009). Exceptions to this paradigm are also known; for example, processive endoglucanases possess both endoglucanase and exoglucanase activity, cleaving chains at internal sites and then attacking the exposed ends, and, in some fungi, depolymerization of cellulose seems to occur at least partially by oxidative rather than hydrolytic processes (Baldrian & Valaskova 2008). In aerobic micro-organisms such as Trichoderma and Cellulomonas, cellulolytic enzymes are typically secreted into the growth medium (although often a considerable proportion of activity is cell associated), but in anaerobic organisms such as Clostridium, the enzymes are typically associated with the cell wall in a complex known as the cellulosome (Doi & Kosugi 2004; Ding et al. 2008), consisting of multiple interchangeable enzymic subunits attached via binding domains to a scaffolding protein that is attached to the cell wall. In addition to cellulases of these three classes, cellulose-degrading organisms invariably possess enzymes for the degradation of associated polysaccharides such as hemicellulose. This is seen even in organisms such as Cytophaga hutchinsonii, which are unable to assimilate sugars derived from hemicellulose hydrolysis (Xie et al. 2007); presumably hemicellulose breakdown is required to expose cellulose fibres.Paradigmatic process of cellulose degradation (Lynd et al. 2002). (a) Endoglucanases (EG) cleave cellulose chains at random positions to expose reducing and non-reducing ends. (b) Exoglucanases (cellobiohydrolases, CBH) move along the chain cleaving cellobiose residues from either the reducing or non-reducing end. (c) β-Glucosidases (BG) hydrolyse cellobiose to glucose, preventing accumulation of cellobiose that would inhibit cellobiohydrolase activity.It is noteworthy that effective cellulose-degrading organisms always seem to possess multiple enzymes of each of the classes mentioned. For example, Trichoderma is known to produce at least five endoglucanases, two exoglucanases and two β-glucosidases (Lynd et al. 2002), and C. fimi produces at least six endoglucanases and two exoglucanases, as well as multiple genes involved in hemicellulose degradation (Stoll 2001). In the C. thermocellum cellulosome, the 22 known interchangeable enzymic subunits available for incorporation include at least nine endoglucanases, four exoglucanases and five hemicellulases (Lynd et al. 2002; Kumar et al. 2008); a preliminary analysis of the draft genome sequence suggested the presence of 71 cellulosomal components, 23 of which were putative cellulases (Zverlov et al. 2005); and the CAZY website lists 69 glycoside hdyrolases and 4 polysaccharide lyase genes in this genome (Cantarel et al. 2009). Other cellulolytic organisms are less well studied, but an increasing number of genome sequences are available (Rubin 2008) and examination of some of these suggests that the same pattern holds; for example, the genome sequence of the gliding bacterium C. hutchinsonii (Xie et al. 2007) includes 11 genes annotated as possible or probable endoglucanases and four β-glucosidases, as well as numerous miscellaneous β-glycosidases, and 11 xylanases and acetylxylanesterases, which may be involved in hemicellulose degradation; oddly, no recognizable exoglucanases are present, suggesting that this organism may rely on processive endoglucanases or may use an unusual method of cellulose degradation. The pattern also holds in multi-cellular organisms; for example, the genome sequence of the plant-parasitic nematode Meloidogyne incognita was reported to encode 21 cellulases and 6 xylanases, in addition to multiple other enzymes potentially involved in plant cell wall degradation (Abad et al. 2008).The question arises as to why multiple representatives of each class of enzyme are beneficial. Presumably this is owing to the complexity of the substrate—while each individual β-1,4-glycosidic bond may be chemically identical, the complex nature of the surrounding material means that they are not in identical contexts. One might therefore expect to observe synergy in cellulose degradation between different enzymes of the same class, as well as between enzymes of different classes. Synergy between cellulases of different classes has been well studied (Lynd et al. 2002; Zhang & Lynd 2004), but relatively few studies seem to describe synergy between representatives of the same class. One example concerns the endoglucanases CelZ and CelY of the plant pathogenic bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi; these were reported to display synergy in degradation of amorphous cellulose, with CelY having preference for cleavage of longer chains, whereas CelZ showed greater activity with shorter chain substrates, which were not effectively cleaved by CelY (Zhou & Ingram 2000, 2001). Clearly, the role of intra-class synergy in biomass degradation requires further investigation. With regard to studies of synergy between enzymes of different classes, synergy is observed in some cases, but not in others; indeed, Andersen et al. (2008) recently reported that a mixture of endoglucanase Cel45A and exoglucanase Cel6A of Humicola insolens and β-glucosidase of Penicillium brasilianum showed synergy on amorphous cellulose, but on crystalline cellulose the enzymes actually seemed to inhibit each other, an effect attributed to competition for binding sites on the cellulose. Other studies with different enzymes have reported the opposite effect, with synergy seen on crystalline cellulose but not amorphous cellulose (Valjamae et al. 1999; Zhang & Lynd 2004). Concerning synergy between larger groups of enzymes, an interesting recent report (Zverlov et al. 2008) describes mutant strains of C. thermocellum with disruptions of the scaffoldin gene cipA, encoding the protein that normally keeps all of the various enzymic components of the cellulosome in close spatial proximity to each other and to cellulose-binding components. The mutant strains showed a similar level of activity against soluble substrates, but activity against crystalline cellulose was reduced about 15-fold compared with the wild type, indicating a strong effect of proximity. Clearly, synergy is a complex issue; quantitative kinetic models (Zhang & Lynd 2004, 2006) may help to clarify the situation.Although the gene sequences of many known and presumed cellulases are now available, considerable research effort is being directed towards the search for new cellulase genes from unculturable organisms by metagenomic techniques; for example, Warnecke et al. (2007) reported a metagenomic study of the micro-organisms of the termite hindgut, a highly active cellulolytic micro-environment, and other studies in progress are cited by Rubin (2008). However, in such densely populated systems, with many interacting species, the question of synergy between cellulases, particularly between those produced by different organisms, will become even more complex.Cellulose conversion processes have mainly focused on ethanol production. The basic process involves the use of fungal cellulases, produced mainly by Trichoderma reesei, to partially hydrolyse cellulose (pre-treated to disrupt lignin), and then fermentation of the resulting glucose in a conventional process using S. cerevisiae (Glazer & Nikaido 1995; Lynd et al. 2002). An extension to this process is simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), in which cellulases are added to a bioreactor with cellulose and the production organism, so that cellulose degradation is concurrent with glucose assimilation and product formation. This removes the issue of product inhibition of cellulose degradation and reduces the complexity of the process. In simultaneous saccharification and cofermentation, pentose sugars released by hydrolysis of hemicellulose are fermented in the same process. This requires use of an organism able to ferment these sugars, which are not used by wild-type S. cerevisiae strains. Strains of S. cerevisiae able to ferment xylose have been developed by expression of xylose isomerase of Piromyces, or xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase of Pichia (e.g. Ho et al. 1998; Hector et al. 2008; Hughes et al. 2009; as well as many other reports) or by natural selection of non-recombinant S. cerevisiae to improve xylose fermentation (Attfield & Bell 2006). Also, strains of E. coli and its close relative Klebsiella oxytoca, which can naturally use xylose and arabinose, have been engineered to produce ethanol with high yields (discussed further below). The logical final development is ‘consolidated bioprocessing’ (CBP; Lynd et al. 2002, 2005), in which a single organism produces cellulases, assimilates the sugars released and produces the desired product. Despite recent decreases in the cost of exogenous fungal cellulases used in current processes, the calculations of Lynd et al. (2005) indicate that CBP will still lead to a substantial decrease in overall production costs. Unfortunately, no known natural organism possesses the necessary combination of characteristics. One potential approach is to improve ethanol formation by natural cellulolytic organisms such as C. thermocellum and C. phytofermentans; the other is to transfer a cellulose degradation system into a robust industrial organism capable of high-level biofuel production.A number of companies have been established with the production of cellulosic ethanol as their main aim, and a great deal of public and venture capital funding has been obtained. Several companies, including Bioethanol Japan, Mascoma, Iogen, Verenium and POET, are reportedly operating pilot scale plants, with more expected to open in the near future.Many reports have described the expression of cellulase genes in heterologous hosts, both for research purposes and with the explicit aim of endowing the recipient with the ability to degrade biomass effectively (Lynd et al. 2002, 2005). To summarize, it appears that the expression of highly active enzymes has in many cases been problematic and, while several reports have described recombinant organisms capable of degrading amorphous cellulose and assimilating the resulting sugars, effective degradation of crystalline cellulose without the addition of exogenous cellulases remains elusive. Here, we will consider only a few recent reports giving an indication of the current state of the art.Many reports describe expression of fungal cellulases in S. cerevisiae, with the aim of producing a yeast strain capable of directly fermenting cellulose to ethanol. For example, Cho et al. (1999) reported the integration of multiple copies of the bifunctional endo/exoglucanase of Bacillus sp. DO4 and the β-glucosidase of Bacillus circulans into the chromosomal DNA of S. cerevisiae. Enzyme activity was detected, and there appeared to be somewhat enhanced growth in the presence of cello-oligosaccharides, but it was concluded that higher expression levels would be required to allow effective growth and ethanol production. Cho & Yoo (1999) later reported that the use of this strain in an SSF process significantly reduced the requirement for addition of commercial cellulases. Fujita et al. (2004) reported generation of a recombinant strain of S. cerevisiae expressing T. reesei endoglucanase 11 and cellobiohydrolase 11 together with β-glucosidase 1 of Aspergillus aculeatus. The three enzymes were expressed as fusion proteins attached to the cell surface. The recombinant strain was able to produce about 3 g l−1 ethanol from amorphous cellulose, but growth with cellulose as sole carbon source was not reported; the organism was pre-grown on a rich medium before being provided with cellulose. Den Haan et al. (2007a) recently described the generation of a strain of S. cerevisiae co-expressing endoglucanase EG1 of the filamentous fungus T. reesei and β-glucosidase BGL1 of the yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, and demonstrated that the recombinant strain could grow with amorphous cellulose (phosphoric acid swollen cellulose, PASC) as sole carbohydrate source, and produce ethanol, though, for reasons not entirely clear, only 1 g l−1 ethanol was produced. The authors stated that this was the first report of a yeast strain able to grow with cellulose as sole carbohydrate source, though it should be noted that the growth medium also contained yeast extract and peptone. More effective cellulose degradation will require the expression of an exoglucanase (cellobiohydrolase); den Haan et al. (2007b) investigated the expression of four cellobiohydrolase genes from the fungi T. reesei, Aspergillus niger and P. chrysosporium in S. cerevisiae and reported that all four were successfully expressed and secreted, though at rather low levels.Where bacteria, rather than yeasts, are used as the host, most reports concern the introduction of cellulase genes into strains of E. coli or its close relative, K. oxytoca, expressing the pet (production of ethanol) operon (Ingram et al. 1987), which allows these organisms to generate ethanol with high yield (discussed further in §3 below). Klebsiella oxytoca is similar to E. coli but has a greater ability to assimilate and degrade cello-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides. The most advanced of these cases seems to be the report of E. coli and K. oxytoca strains expressing the endoglucanases CelY and CelZ from the plant pathogenic bacterium E. chrysanthemi (Zhou et al. 2001). This organism was able to ferment amorphous cellulose to ethanol without the addition of exogenous cellulases and was also reported to require smaller amounts of supplemental cellulases when fermenting crystalline cellulose in an SSF process (Zhou & Ingram 2001).Thus, despite many experiments expressing various combinations of cellulases in different hosts, effective growth with crystalline cellulose as sole carbon source remains elusive. One obvious issue is expression level. Owing to the rather low specific activities of cellulases, relatively large quantities of cellulases must be produced and secreted in order for sugars to be released at a high enough rate to support growth. Lynd et al. (2005) have calculated that the required expression levels are within achievable ranges, but suggest that these levels have not yet been achieved with active cellulases. Another potential issue is the relatively low energy yield of the homoethanologenic fermentation, even compared with other fermentations such as the mixed acid fermentation; coupled with the high energy requirement for cellulase production and secretion, this may make energy balance a significant issue for effective ethanol production from cellulosic material. The allocation of ATP between growth and cellulase production may be an important parameter for manipulation (van Walsum & Lynd 1998).It seems clear that a number of issues must be resolved in order to generate the cellulose-degradation module required for the IBPM. The simplest interpretation of the failure to achieve efficient cellulose degradation in a heterologous host is that cellulase expression levels are simply not sufficient (Lynd et al. 2005). Given the technologies available for high-level protein expression and secretion in both yeast and bacteria in the biopharmaceuticals industry, this would seem to be a relatively straightforward problem to address. Synthetic biology using modular components allows the easy combination of coding sequences with libraries of promoters, enhancers and secretion signals, to determine empirically which systems provide the best results. Perhaps a more interesting possibility is that synergy, both within and between the different classes of cellulase, plays a more critical role than has been assumed. This might explain why cellulose-degrading micro-organisms, in contrast to, for example, starch-degrading organisms, always seem to contain a battery of different enzymes with very similar predicted activities. Production of a proper blend of perhaps a dozen or so enzymes might result in a much higher level of activity, reducing the amount of total protein that must be secreted, and thus the energy cost associated with enzyme production and secretion. Without extremely detailed characterization of the properties of all of these enzymes, it will be very difficult to predict exactly which blends of enzymes are likely to give the best results. One way forward would be a massive parallel screening exercise in which a large library of different combinations of cellulase-encoding genes was prepared and screened in parallel for release of sugars from various different classes of cellulosic substrate, allowing empirical determination of the best systems. The modular, interchangeable nature of components such as BioBricks is ideally suited to such experiments (figure 1). A library of putative biomass-degrading enzymes from different organisms could be generated, and parallel assembly processes used to generate organisms expressing a variety of different combinations, which could then be screened for effective biomass degradation ability. In this way, one could hope to determine empirically which combinations of enzymes are most effective for degradation of different classes of biomass substrate. The results obtained from such an exercise could then be used to generate hypotheses that could be used to guide further experiments, ultimately resulting in an efficient set of heterologous cellulose-degradation genes suitable for incorporation into the IBPM, or perhaps several alternative sets suited to different types of substrate.We have made a small start in this direction, generating BioBricks based on the major endoglucanases and exoglucanases of C. fimi and the putative endoglucanases of C. hutchinsonii (Elfick et al. 2008; S. Lakhundi, C.-K. Liu and C. E. French, unpublished data). Considering the ongoing rapid development of synthetic biology and the urgency of this problem, no doubt others are following similar approaches.Following conversion of biomass to assimilable sugars, the IBPM must convert this material to a product that can be used as a liquid fuel and/or chemical feedstock. Ethanol has attracted the most attention, but other products have also been considered, including n-butanol, other higher alcohols, fatty acid ethyl esters, liquid terpenoids and alkanes (Antoni et al. 2007; Atsumi & Liao 2008; Fortman et al. 2008; Wackett 2008). Here, we will briefly consider some of the leading contenders, with particular reference to the prospect of transferring the required production pathway into a new chassis.The potential product that has attracted the most attention is ethanol. Many organisms produce small amounts of ethanol during anaerobic growth, but production of ethanol as the main or sole product (homoethanologenic fermentation) seems to be rather rare, perhaps because of the low energy yield of this fermentation, and has mainly been studied in the yeast S. cerevisiae and the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis. Formation of ethanol from pyruvate (a universal intermediate of glucose assimilation) is straightforward, requiring only two enzymes: pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), which converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde and CO2; and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which reduces acetaldehyde to ethanol, re-oxidizing NADH. Thus, transfer of these two genes to a host organism, perhaps with diversion of pyruvate away from other pathways, should be sufficient to allow ethanol production. Early experiments in this area were performed by Ingram et al. (1987), who used the pdc and adh genes of Z. mobilis to generate an artificial operon designated pet (production of ethanol), which was successfully expressed in E. coli, as well as the related organism K. oxytoca (Ohta et al. 1991), which has a greater capacity to take up cello-oligosaccharides and xylo-oligosaccharides (Burchhardt & Ingram 1992; Wood & Ingram 1992). This technology is reportedly being applied by Verenium and Bioethanol Japan. The pet operon was reported to work poorly in Gram-positive bacteria; an alternative system, using pdc and adh from the Gram-positive bacteria Sarcina ventriculi and Geobacillus stearothermophilus, respectively, has been reported to work well in Gram-positive hosts such as Bacillus megaterium (Talarico et al. 2005). To assuage any possible concern about the use of genetically modified bacteria on a large scale, Kim et al. (2007) reported the generation of a non-recombinant strain of E. coli, which ferments glucose and xylose to ethanol, despite lacking PDC. This involved inactivating mutations in the genes encoding pyruvate-formate lyase and lactate dehydrogenase, which are required for the major fermentation pathways in wild-type E. coli, and altered regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase to allow its expression under fermentative conditions. Production of acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase rather than pyruvate-formate lyase leads to excess NADH production, meaning that a higher proportion of acetyl-CoA must be reduced to ethanol rather than converted to acetate as in the standard mixed acid fermentation.Ethanol has a number of advantages as a biofuel: because of its increasing use in the USA and Brazil, a growing infrastructure exists for its distribution, and vehicles able to use it, either in pure form or blended with gasoline, are increasingly available. Blends such as E10 (10% ethanol, 90% gasoline) can be used in unmodified engines, but higher levels of ethanol require engine modifications. ‘Flex-fuel’ cars, able to run on either gasoline or E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline) are increasingly popular. However, as a fuel, ethanol also has a number of disadvantages. Most importantly, recovery by distillation requires a large energy input, and high water miscibility means that it cannot be transported in pipelines, but must be delivered in tankers. It is also rather corrosive. Therefore, a number of other microbial fuel products are under consideration. Perhaps the best developed of these is n-butanol (Antoni et al. 2007). Butanol can reportedly be used directly in standard petrol engines without modification; it has a higher energy density than ethanol, is less corrosive and is not fully miscible with water, limiting its tendency to absorb water from the surroundings. Butanol is produced, along with acetone and ethanol, in the ‘ABE’ fermentation, using Clostridium acetobutylicum (Lee et al. 2008). Historically, this was an important process, but became generally uneconomical compared with petrochemical processes around the 1960s. With increasing oil costs, and increasing concern about CO2 emissions, there has been a resurgence of interest in fermentative butanol production. The C. acetobutylicum process suffers from relatively low yields and low product concentrations, owing to the toxicity of butanol to the producing organism. Inui et al. (2008) and Atsumi et al. (2008a) have both reported expression of the butanol production pathway in E. coli, leading to production of significant quantities of n-butanol under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Another of the ABE pathway products, acetone, is also a potentially interesting product, and has been produced in aerobically grown E. coli expressing four C. acetobutylicum genes (Bermejo et al. 1998); due to its high volatility, acetone could be recovered directly from the exhaust gas stream. Co-expression of a secondary alcohol dehydrogenase allows acetone produced in this way to be reduced to isopropanol, another potential biofuel or feedstock (Hanai et al. 2007; Jojima et al. 2008). Non-fermentative processes for the production of four- and five-carbon alcohols have also been explored. For example, Atsumi et al. (2008b) recently reported a process for the production of branched chain alcohols, such as isobutanol, in E. coli, by diverting and reducing 2-ketoacid intermediates from amino acid biosynthetic pathways.A microbial process for the production of biodiesel, dubbed ‘micro-diesel’, has also been reported (Kalscheuer et al. 2006). This process used E. coli expressing the pet operon, leading to ethanol production, together with an acyltransferase from Acinetobacter baylyi, capable of reacting ethanol with fatty acids to generate fatty acid ethyl esters, which can be used as biodiesel. Exogenous fatty acids had to be added, but the authors speculated that upregulation of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway might allow direct production of biodiesel from sugars. The fatty acid biosynthetic pathway can also be redirected to the production of long-chain alcohols and fatty esters, which are also potential biofuels under commercial investigation (Zhihou & Fernando 2008).From a practical point of view, perhaps the simplest replacement for fossil hydrocarbons would be non-fossil hydrocarbons. The bacterium Vibrio furnissii has been reported to produce substantial quantities of n-alkanes (Park et al. 2001, 2005), apparently via reduction of long-chain alcohols (Park 2005); however, another recent study found no evidence for hydrocarbon production in this organism (Wackett et al. 2007), leaving this promising pathway in limbo, although at least one patent has been filed suggesting that long-chain fatty alcohols can be enzymically reduced to alkanes (Zhihou & Fernando 2008). Certain algae produce high levels of hydrocarbons, including terpenoids and alkanes (Raja et al. 2008). Perhaps the best studied of these is Botryococcus braunii (Metzger & Largeau 2005), which has been reported to produce high levels (up to 60% of dry weight) of both long-chain alkenes and branched-chain isoprenoid hydrocarbons. Considerable research has gone into the development of processes for the large-scale growth of such algae for hydrocarbon production (Chisti 2007), with a number of companies established specifically for this purpose, but to date, very little genetic work appears to have been done with such algae, meaning that transfer of the hydrocarbon synthesis pathway to a more convenient host would not be possible without a great deal more research. Given the level of interest in this area and the decreasing costs of sequencing, B. braunii would seem to be a strong candidate for a genome sequencing project.Another possible source of liquid fuels is the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. Isoprenoids are a hugely diverse family of molecules synthesized from five-carbon precursors (isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate) via the mevalonate pathway, in yeast and other eukaryotes, or the non-mevalonate (DXP) pathway, in plastids and most bacteria. Many reports have described metabolic engineering of isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways for the production of a wide variety of products (Kirby & Keasling 2008). For example, Keasling et al. have reported the upregulation of isoprenoid synthesis in both E. coli (Martin et al. 2003) and S. cerevisiae (Ro et al. 2006) for the production of the antimalarial drug artemisinin. This process is being further developed by Amyris Biotechnologies, which is also investigating the production of liquid substitutes for gasoline and diesel produced by enzymic or chemical reduction of 5- and 15-carbon products from the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway (Withers et al. 2007; Renninger & McPhee 2008; Renninger et al. 2008a,b).Of course, there are many other useful products that could be produced from cellulose apart from biofuels. One particularly intriguing possibility would be the conversion of cellulose to starch (Elfick et al. 2008). Standard synthetic biology chassis organisms such as E. coli, B. subtilis and S. cerevisiae produce glycogen as a carbon storage material. Glycogen is an α-1,4- and α-1,6-linked glucose polymer substantially similar to the precursor of starch in plants. While the processes leading to starch production are not entirely understood, mutational studies have implicated a set of enzymes, including isoamylase and granule-bound starch synthase, which are believed to play the major roles (Ball & Morell 2003), and a synthetic approach might be the ideal way to elucidate this pathway. A moderately efficient process for conversion of cellulosic biomass to starch could revolutionize agriculture, allowing the cultivation of plants chosen for rapid growth rather than those optimized for diversion of photosynthate to starch production. Starch thus produced could be used as an animal feed, currently a major use for the US grain harvest (Dale 2008), or as an intermediate in biofuel production, since hydrolysis of starch is much more rapid and inexpensive than hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass. This could increase the amount of grain available for human food use.The assembly of complex metabolic pathways is one of the flagship applications for synthetic biology. The modular nature of BioBricks and similar parts facilitates the construction of large multi-gene constructs using standardized promoters, ribosome-binding sites and termination sequences to control expression levels, as well as allowing genes to be rearranged easily, new genes to be added and other manipulations to be performed using a set of standard techniques. The remarkable results achieved by teams of undergraduate students in the annual International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM 2008) hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology testify to the simplicity of assembling metabolic pathways using BioBricks. Wider adoption of this approach can only make it faster and easier to generate new product-formation modules for incorporation into the IBPM.Biofuel products must form a combustible liquid around room temperature. Such hydrophobic substances are invariably more or less harmful to cells, primarily through damage to membranes. For economical purification, it is important that the products be produced at a high concentration, but this is generally limited by the ability of the cells to survive such exposure. It is therefore of great interest to examine the mechanisms by which cells survive exposure to damaging levels of solvents and the means by which this tolerance can be enhanced.Solvent tolerance in various organisms has been linked to a wide variety of mechanisms, including alteration of cis:trans membrane lipid ratios, alteration of membrane lipid headgroups, alteration to lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, production of efflux pumps that push hydrophobic molecules out of the cell and release of hydrophobic molecules in membrane vesicles (Ramos et al. 2002; Sardessai & Bhosle 2002). These studies have mainly concerned solvent-susceptible mutants and suppressors of such mutations. Relatively few studies seem to have reported increases in solvent tolerance by overexpression of particular proteins. In the case of E. coli, most solvent-tolerant mutants were found to overexpress the regulatory gene marA, leading to overexpression of a number of other genes; solvent tolerance seemed to be particularly associated with the efflux pump formed by AcrAB together with the outer membrane protein TolC, since deletion of any of these three genes abolished the effect (Aono 1998). More recent studies have focused on analysis of genes with altered expression patterns in mutants with increased solvent tolerance. One such study led to the discovery that solvent tolerance could be enhanced by overexpression of glpC, encoding the membrane anchor subunit of the anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase GlpABC (Shimizu et al. 2005). This effect seemed to be independent of any catalytic activity of this enzyme, suggesting that it was in fact because of alteration of the membrane properties owing to insertion of excess GlpC. In a similar study, overexpression of the mannose phosphotransferase uptake transporter ManXYZ was found to increase organic solvent tolerance (Okochi et al. 2007a). In this case, overexpression of the individual subunits was not effective, suggesting that the intact transporter was required. Overexpression of manXYZ was also found to increase the solvent tolerance of a marA-overexpressing strain, indicating an additive or synergistic effect. In a final example, it was found that overexpression of the chaperone prefoldin from Pyrococcus horikoshii led to increased solvent tolerance (Okochi et al. 2007b). In contrast to the preceding examples, this did not seem to be associated with altered cell surface properties as such, but rather with decreased protein denaturation.Relatively few studies have reported increased solvent tolerance in eukaryotes. Recent reports mainly concern the mutant S. cerevisiae strain KK-211, isolated on the basis of iso-octane tolerance (Kawamoto et al. 2001). The mutation was later identified as being a point mutation in a transcription factor, Pdr1p (Matsui et al. 2008), which affected the transcription of multiple genes (Miura et al. 2000; Matsui et al. 2006). The mechanistic basis of the enhanced solvent tolerance does not seem to have been established. However, an interesting alternative approach was reported by Zou et al. (2002), who expressed a library of random fragments derived from cDNA as cell surface-exposed fusion proteins. One clone, designated n13, was found to show enhanced tolerance to n-nonane; the DNA insert was found to encode 91 amino acids from ORF YGR193C. While the basis of the enhanced solvent tolerance is not altogether clear, it is presumably related to altered cell surface properties, and this may be a good method for empirical generation of solvent-tolerant strains.In view of the multiple mechanisms that have been demonstrated to lead to enhanced solvent tolerance, it would be very interesting to determine whether solvent tolerance could be further enhanced by combining these mechanisms (Okochi et al. 2007a). As discussed above, the use of synthetic biology tools such as BioBricks would provide a simple and effective way to examine the co-expression of different combinations of factors, casting light on their interactions. Libraries of BioBricks encoding genes associated with different solvent tolerance mechanisms could easily be generated and tested in different combinations, screening directly for survival in the presence of different solvents. This approach could rapidly provide a set of solvent tolerance modules suited for different products, which could be combined with different product-formation modules for incorporation into the IBPM.Economical conversion of cheap, abundant, renewable biomass to valuable products will require the combination of a range of different characteristics that do not naturally occur in any one organism. We have seen that metabolic pathways for product formation can be transferred from one host to another, and that synthetic biology offers improved methods for investigating synergy between the many gene products involved in biomass degradation and solvent tolerance. Synthetic biology also offers a suite of rapidly improving tools for the combination of multiple genetic modules in a single chassis (host) organism. For example, different combinations of biomass degradation genes could be generated to provide a set of biomass-degradation modules suited to different types of cellulosic substrate materials. Similarly, product-formation modules could be generated allowing the production of different products suitable for use as biofuels or chemical industry feedstocks, and these could be combined with solvent-tolerance modules suitable for protecting the organism against each particular product. For any desired combination of substrate and product, one could simply choose the appropriate modules for substrate degradation, product formation and product tolerance, and combine them in a robust, high performance chassis to generate an IBPM for each application. Thus, the fortuitous combination of the rapidly developing discipline of synthetic biology and the increasingly urgent requirement for improved biomass conversion processes offers the potential for a sustainable, oil-free future.One contribution to a Theme Supplement ‘Synthetic biology: history, challenges and prospects’.One contribution to a Theme Supplement ‘Synthetic biology: history, challenges and prospects’."
PMC2854817,"Mechanism, Structure, and Inhibition of O-GlcNAc Processing Enzymes",False,"The post-translational modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins with O-linked 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose (O-GlcNAc) is a topic of considerable interest and attracts a great deal of research effort. O-GlcNAcylation is a dynamic process which can occur multiple times over the lifetime of a protein, sometimes in a reciprocal relationship with phosphorylation. Several hundred proteins, which are involved in a diverse range of cellular processes, have been identified as being modified with the monosaccharide. The control of the O-GlcNAc modification state on different protein targets appears to be important in the aetiology of a number of diseases, including type II diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Two enzymes are responsible for the addition and removal of the O-GlcNAc modification: uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), respectively. Over the past decade the volume of information known about these two enzymes has increased significantly. In particular, mechanistic studies of OGA, in conjunction with structural studies of bacterial homologues of OGA have stimulated the design of inhibitors and offered a rationale for the binding of certain potent and selective inhibitors. Mechanistic information about OGT lags a little way behind OGA, but the recent deduction of the structure of an OGT bacterial homologue should now drive these studies forward.The post-translational modification of proteins with a single 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranose (GlcNAc) residue was first detected 25 years ago [1]. Despite considerable research efforts in the field during this time, the precise functional roles this simple monosaccharide plays in vivo remain a topic of considerable continuing interest. The GlcNAc moiety is attached through a β-glycosidic O-linkage (thus O-GlcNAc) to the serine or threonine residues of proteins. Unlike all other forms of eukaryotic protein glycosylation, which occurs within the secretory pathway, proteins modified with O-GlcNAc are found in the nucleus or cytoplasm. The modification is ubiquitous through all higher eukaryotes. While disruption of the gene encoding the enzyme responsible for transfer of O-GlcNAc showed it was essential for embryonic stem cell viability in mice [2] and more recently for development in Drosophila melanogaster [3, 4], loss of the genes encoding the enzymes for either addition or removal of the monosaccharide in Caenorhabditis elegans results in growth defects [5, 6].The extent of the protein targets that get O-GlcNAc modified is most likely not yet fully established, but to date several hundred have been identified [7-9]. The protein targets have widespread functions in cells, and include classes of proteins such as transcription factors (such as Sp1, p53 and c-myc [10, 11]), cytoskeletal proteins (such as talin, α-tubulin and the neurofilament proteins [12-15]), nuclear pore proteins (such as p62 and p180 [16-18]), chaperones (such as HSP70 [12]), as well as enzymes such as RNA polymerase II [19] and the proteasome [20]. The control of the O-GlcNAc modified state of different protein targets appears important in the aetiology of a number of diseases, including type II diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Control of global O-GlcNAc levels is believed to play a role in mediating insulin resistance [21-23], a key feature of type II diabetes, although recently this widely held view has been questioned [24-26] suggesting that more research in this area may clarify the processes involved. The balance between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation on tau is implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease; tau normally stabilizes microtubules but it is thought that its hyperphosphorylation leads to its aggregation into paired helical filaments which, in turn, aggregate to form the neurofibrillary tangles that constitute one half of the pathology of this disease [27]. Control of O-GlcNAc levels may also be aberrant in cancer, since, for example, the tumour suppressor protein p53 and protooncogene product c-myc are modified [11, 28].The O-GlcNAc modification is dynamic, with cycling of the addition and removal of the monosaccharide occurring several times over the lifetime of a target protein [29]. In addition, O-GlcNAcylation has some interplay with phosphorylation (Fig. 1) [30]; the modifications have been observed to occur independently on the same serine or threonine residue of a protein (such as c-myc [31]) or competitively at adjacent or nearby residues (such as p53 [28]), which may allow control of cellular signalling. Although to date only a limited number of O-GlcNAc sites have been mapped, there appears to be no consensus sequence, unlike N-linked glycosylation. It has been noted, however, that Pro-Val-Ser is present in a significant portion of the sites mapped, which is a sequence similar to that recognized by the proline-directed kinases [8, 32, 33].Dynamic interplay between the O-GlcNAc modification and phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues which occurs over the lifetime of a protein. Phosphorylation is modulated by a multitude of kinases and phosphatases, whereas the addition and removal of the O-GlcNAc modification is catalysed by two enzymes, uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide β -N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT) and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA), respectively. O-GlcNAc, however, is often found at sites that are not phosphorylated and competition in some cases may be indirect by modification of a nearby residue.The cycling of the O-GlcNAc modification is modulated by two enzymes; uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine: polypeptide β -N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (OGT) [34, 35] is responsible for addition of the monosaccharide and a β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, known as O-GlcNAcase (OGA) [36, 37], catalyses removal of the moiety (Fig. 1). The presence of just one enzyme for the addition and one enzyme for the removal of O-GlcNAc in an organism differs greatly from the multitude of kinases and phosphatases that are responsible for phosphorylation [38, 39]. The question of how these two enzymes can recognise and modify such a large number of completely unrelated proteins, with no recognisable consensus sequence, has started to be addressed over the last decade or so. The deduction of the structure of homologues of each enzyme and a number of sophisticated recognition and mechanistic studies have started to elucidate some of these details, but there is still some way to go before the regulation and mode of action of OGT and OGA are fully understood.OGA, or as it was first described hexosaminidase C [36, 40-43], was isolated and characterized at least a decade before the O-GlcNAc modification on proteins itself was elucidated [1]. It was later purified from bovine brain, sequenced and subsequently the gene was cloned, protein over-expressed recombinantly and characterized [37, 44]; the cloned sequence was identical to the MGEA5 (meningioma expressed antigen 5) gene which had been identified in human meningiomas and preliminarily characterized as a hyaluronidase [45]. The properties of the recombinant enzyme cloned by the Hart group were in agreement with previous studies of the purified OGA [46]; the enzyme is a monomer [44], and has an optimal activity at neutral pH, as expected for an enzyme located in the nucleocytoplasm. In addition, OGA showed an apparent absolute selectivity for GlcNAc-containing substrates (including O-GlcNAc modified synthetic peptides), and did not hydrolyse GalNAc-configured substrates [37]. OGA activity was found to be present in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of cells, although when the gene encoding OGA was transfected into cells for over-expression, the recombinant tagged enzyme was observed to localize primarily to the cytoplasm. OGA is found in all tissue types, with highest expression levels in the brain, placenta, and pancreas [37].The kinetic and physical properties of OGA contrast with the human lysosomal hexosaminidases which perform optimally at acidic pH, consistent with their localization to the lysosome, and are able to hydrolyse substrates containing either GlcNAc or GalNAc [37]. There are two genes encoding the lysosomal hexosaminidases in humans, HEXA encodes the α subunit and HEXB encodes the β subunit. The protein products are dimeric isozymes in vivo: hexosaminidase A (HexA) is a heterodimer of an α and β subunit, hexosaminidase B (HexB) is a homodimer of two β subunits, and hexosaminidase S, which is unstable, is a homodimer of two α subunits [47]. Mutations in these hexosaminidases are responsible for the GM2 gangliosidosis observed in Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases [47]. A fourth hexosaminidase, named hexosaminidase D (HexD), has also been purified from brain tissues [42, 48, 49], but is less well characterised and the function in vivo currently unknown. The gene encoding HexD (HEXDC) has recently been cloned from mouse and human and the protein expressed recombinantly [50]. These studies demonstrate that this enzyme, like OGA, operates under neutral conditions and is localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm. HexD differs from OGA in that it prefers substrates containing GalNAc, although it appears to also process GlcNAc-configured substrates. HexD, however, shows no activity toward O-GlcNAc modified synthetic peptides and so is likely to fulfil a cellular role distinct from that of OGA [50].The development of a coherent and reliable classification system for carbohydrate processing enzymes, by primary sequence similarity, into different ‘families’ has been a great boon to those studying these enzymes. The families of enzymes are listed in the Carbohydrate Active enZyme (CAZy) database [51] (available at http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/). A feature of virtually all CAZy families is that, because the primary sequence dictates structure, and structure ultimately determines function, the catalytic mechanism is conserved within a family [52]. It is interesting to note that HexA, HexB, and HexD all belong to glycoside hydrolase family 20 (GH20), whereas HexC (OGA) is a member of family 84 (GH84). Family GH20 has been well characterized, both structurally and mechanistically for a number of bacterial enzymes [53, 54] and the human hexosaminidases HexA and HexB [55, 56]. The GH20 enzymes, which catalyse hydrolysis with retention of anomeric configuration, were shown to use a substrate participation mechanism using the acetamido group for nucleophilic attack at the anomeric carbon to create an oxazoline intermediate (Fig. 2). The intermediate is hydrolysed by a water molecule, activated by an enzymic general base, which attacks the anomeric carbon. This mechanism differs from the ‘classical’ glycoside hydrolase mechanism first postulated by Koshland, where the nucleophile is an enzymic residue [57], most commonly a carboxylate group [58].Substrate-assisted mechanism used by OGA to catalyze hydrolysis with retention of anomeric configuration. During the first step, the acetamido group attacks the anomeric carbon to create an oxazoline intermediate. A water molecule, which is activated by an enzymic general base, attacks the anomeric carbon to hydrolyze the intermediate during the second step. The numbering shown corresponds to the catalytic residues proposed for human OGA (Asp174 is the polarizing residue of the acetamido group and Asp175 is the general acid/base residue).Full length OGA is a large 103 kDa (916 amino acid) protein [37], which has been reported to stably interact with several proteins [37]. A 75 kDa splice variant also exists that arises from failure to splice out intron 10; this intron contains a stop codon so the protein encoded by the resulting transcript lacks the C-terminus of the enzyme, but does contain an additional 15 residues encoded by the intron [59]. This shorter isoform localizes predominantly to the nucleus [59], but when cloned recombinantly initially appeared to be inactive [44]. Interestingly, although there was originally debate, primarily based on bioinformatics studies and sequence alignments, about whether the active site (for OGA) was likely to reside at the N-terminal region [60, 61] or the C-terminus [62], OGA activity was shown conclusively to occur in a recombinant protein comprising residues 1-350, whereas a protein consisting of residues 351-916 was inactive. The rate of catalysis for this N-terminal recombinant enzyme, however, was around 1000-fold lower than for the full length protein, which is consistent with a functionally important role for the C-terminus [63]. A different study of the mouse OGA also confirmed the activity is encoded by a polypeptide comprising the N-terminal region, between residues 63-283 [64]. More recently, the short nuclear splice variant has been shown to have catalytic activity, albeit at a much lower rate than the full length enzyme [65, 66].Sequence alignments indicated the C-terminal region has amino acid sequence similarity to known acetyltransferases [59]; OGA, when over-expressed in mammalian cells, was later reported to possess acetyltransferase activity towards histone synthetic substrates and free core histones [67]. More recently, however, efforts to independently verify this activity have been unsuccessful [68]. OGA also contains a caspase-3 cleavage site [44], an executioner caspase in apoptosis [69], which might explain the early observation of a 65 kDa fragment in cells [44]. This proteolytic processing by caspase-3 was shown to occur both in vitro and in vivo under conditions of Fas-induced apoptosis [68]. Surprisingly, after caspase cleavage, the OGA activity is retained, at least in vitro [44]. It is interesting to note, however, that if the N-terminal region (before the caspase cleavage site) is over-expressed recombinantly in cells alone there appears to be no OGA activity, but if co-over-expressed with the C-terminal region there is abundant activity present; this observation suggests an interaction between the two domains may be required for OGA to be optimally active [68]. The precise roles played by this C-terminal domain, however, remain to be uncovered.Consistent with the N-terminal domain of OGA harbouring the catalytic machinery required for O-GlcNAc processing, this domain bears similarity to around 70 open reading frames, predominantly found within bacteria, that place this enzyme into family GH84 of the CAZy system [51]. The sequence identity between the N-terminal domain of OGA found in eukaryotes, and in particular mammals, is extremely high (for example 97% between human and mouse; 53% between human and Drosophila melanogaster), but lower between eukaryotes and prokaryotes (the highest sequence identity is between human and Streptomyces pyogenes at 36%). Notably, GH84 enzymes bear no obvious sequence similarity to family GH20 enzymes, which includes the lysosomal β-hexosaminidases.A significant advance in the analysis of OGA and other GH84 members came from a study which deduced the mechanism of the enzyme and paved the way for the design of potent and selective inhibitors [70]. OGA hydrolyses β-N-acetylglucosamine substrates with retention of anomeric configuration [70], a proposal verified in a study of the Streptococcus pyogenes GH84 homologue [71]. Measurement of the dependence of catalytic rates on pH produced a bell-shaped curve, reflecting the ionization of important catalytic residues, with a pH optimum of 6.5 and kinetic pKa values for the two enzymic residues of approximately 5.0 and 7.5 [63, 64, 72]. To determine if OGA used a ‘classical’ hydrolytic mechanism, as found for some enzymes processing substrates with a 2-acetamido group, such as the GH22 lysozymes [73] and the GH3 β-N-acetylhexosaminidases [74, 75], or the less common substrate participation mechanism which involves the acetamido group acting as a nucleophile (Fig. 2), Macauley et al. conducted Taft-like linear free energy relationships (for a brief overview on this approach see ref. [58]). This involved using a series of substrates bearing varying numbers of fluorine atoms substituted at the methyl group of the N-acetyl substituent in order to determine the effect on the rate of catalysis [70]. The electronegative fluorine atoms lower the basicity of the carbonyl group and, if OGA used a substrate participation mechanism as described for the GH20 enzymes, a decrease in rate of the enzyme catalyzed reaction would be expected. Such a trend was observed for both the human β-hexosaminidase and OGA; the slopes of these trends, however, were not equivalent, suggesting differences between these human enzymes either in the steric constraints in the active site or the position of the transition state along the reaction coordinate [70].OGA was demonstrated to be able to hydrolyse both O- and S-linked synthetic substrates, using the same substrate participation mechanism, with similar efficiencies [72] (unlike most other glycosidases where this comparison has been made). Interestingly, Taft-like linear free energy analysis on the S-linked substrates showed a steeper slope than with the O-linked substrates suggesting a greater involvement of the 2-acetamido group. This is in agreement with secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements (for a review on kinetic isotope effects see ref. [76]) on the second order rate constant (kcat/KM) where the kH/kD ratios for substrates containing either an O- or an S-glycoside are both large, suggesting dissociative transition states for both substrates. The KIE is slightly larger for the S-glycoside, suggesting the transition state may be later, with accordingly greater involvement of the 2-acetamido group [72]. In addition, Brønsted linear free energy analyses (for a brief overview on this approach see ref. [58]) were conducted to provide insight into the development of relative charge at either the glycosidic oxygen or sulphur atom at these transition states. This study was carried out by measuring the values of the second order rate constant for OGA processing series of both O- and S-linked substrates bearing phenol or thiophenol leaving groups, respectively, with a range of pKa values. Interestingly, the slopes of the plotted lines (equal to βLG) differed between the two series. The slope was shallower (corresponding to a smaller βLG value) for the O-linked series suggesting there was little charge accumulation at the transition state, which is consistent with the kinetic isotope effect data that also suggest an advanced transition state where proton donation and glycosidic bond cleavage are significantly advanced. In contrast, the slope for the S-linked substrates was steep (with a large βLG close to −1) which is consistent with extensive relative negative charge accumulation occurring on the leaving group thiol at the transition state, and hence either no, or extremely little, general acid catalysis. The lack of general acid catalysis for OGA catalyzed cleavage of S-linked substrates was also suggested in the plot of the second order rate constant against pH, which showed the presence of only one ionizable group as opposed to two for O-linked substrates [72].The deduction of the catalytic mechanism used by OGA was aided by data from other families that use the same, but less common, substrate-assisted mechanism for hydrolysis. In addition to GH84, substrate-assisted hydrolysis has been shown to occur in the GH18 family of chitinases [77-80], GH20 family of chitobiases and β-hexosaminidases [53, 54, 56, 79, 81], GH56 family of hyaluronidases [82], very recently in the GH85 family of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases [83-85] (Fig. 3d) and is also likely in GH25 enzymes [86]. Obviously a requirement for the enzymes using this mechanism is the presence of an acetamido group in the substrate which acts as the nucleophile to attack the anomeric position.Three-dimensional structure of a bacterial homologue of OGA.

Figs. (a)-(c) were drawn using MOLSCRIPT [194] and (d) using PYMOL (https://www.pymol.org).Two key enzymic groups (virtually always the carboxyl group of either an aspartate or glutamate residue) have been shown to be important for catalysis during the substrate-assisted mechanism. The mechanistic studies discussed above provide good support for the proposed mechanism with only some subtle variation between GH families. During the first step of the mechanism, one residue which is in its carboxylate form in the resting enzyme orients and polarizes the 2-acetamido group to increase its nucleophilicity, and hence facilitates attack at the anomeric centre to form an oxazoline intermediate. The other residue, a carboxylic acid in the resting enzyme, acts to aid fission of the glycosidic bond and leaving group departure by general acid catalysis (Fig. 2). During the second step, this second carboxyl residue now acts as a general base to facilitate the attack of a water molecule at the anomeric centre of the oxazoline intermediate, while the polarizing residue aids expulsion of the 2-acetamido group from the anomeric position. The net result of these processes is cleavage of the glycosidic bond to liberate the leaving group (the hydroxyl group of the protein in the case of OGA) and the hemiacetal of O-GlcNAc with retained stereochemistry. There is debate as to the absolute role the polarizing residue plays in catalysis and this remains unclear at present; some postulate for some families of glycoside hydrolases using substrate-assisted catalysis that the carboxylate residue electrostatically stabilizes the oxazolinium intermediate [78, 87], whereas others suggest it is more likely to function as a general acid/base to aid formation of the oxazoline intermediate [63, 70].Structural and kinetic methods have been valuable for defining the important residues required for catalysis in these families using substrate participation. In the family GH18 [80, 88] and GH56 [82, 89] enzymes, there is a highly conserved DXE (where X can be any amino acid) motif; in the cases examined, the glutamate served as the acid/base residue and the aspartate acted as the polarizing residue of the 2-acetamido group. The GH85 enzymes appear to have a similar motif to the GH18 and GH56 enzymes, but instead of possessing an aspartate residue, have a highly conserved asparagine residue in the equivalent position (and thus have the motif NXE) [60, 84, 85, 90]. The GH85 crystal structure suggests, however, that a hydrogen bond is formed with the nitrogen atom of the amide moiety of the asparagine residue, and the authors of one report propose that the residue may exist in its imidic acid form, which by acting as a general base is able to aid formation of the oxazoline intermediate [85]. Further studies, however, will be needed to support or discard this proposal. The family GH20 and GH84 enzymes differ from GH18, GH56, and GH85 in that the key catalytic residues are adjacent to each other, in a DE motif; the glutamate acts as the acid/base residue and the aspartate as the polarizing residue of the 2-acetamido group [91-93]. It is interesting to note that families possessing a motif with an amino acid between the two catalytic residues hydrolyse endoglycosidic bonds, whereas GH20 and GH84, which have adjacent catalytic residues, hydrolyse exoglycosidic bonds; this difference is also reflected in the size of the active site pocket (Fig. 3d).Given the conservation of the substrate-assisted mechanism with these other families, the key catalytic residues in OGA were likely to be found in an analogous motif. One bioinformatics study showed that a conserved DD motif in GH84 enzymes could be aligned with the catalytic DE motif found in GH20 enzymes, and postulated that these two aspartate residues would constitute the residues involved in catalysis [60]. There is, however, also a highly conserved DXE motif as found in the GH18 and GH56 enzymes which had also been suggested may include the catalytic residues [64]. The residues in the DD motif, which equate to Asp174 and Asp175 in the human OGA, were mutated to alanine and displayed significant decreases in activity [63]. Perturbations were also observed in the pH dependence of the mutant proteins. The pH dependence for the wild type enzyme is bell-shaped, a shape governed by the two catalytic residues where in the resting enzyme the polarizing residue is likely to be deprotonated and the acid/base residue protonated. Mechanistic studies indicate the acidic limb of the curve is most reasonably assigned to ionization of the polarizing residue, and the basic limb assigned to ionization of the acid/base residue [63]. The pH dependence of the D174A mutant showed only the basic limb, which is consistent with titration of the acid/base residue, and thus implicates Asp174 as the polarizing residue of the acetamido group in catalysis. The pH dependence of D175A was more ambiguous, but rates of hydrolysis were lower at higher pH, which is consistent with Asp175 acting as the acid/base residue. This proposal is in agreement with Brønsted analyses of the D175A mutant, which gave a βLG of −1, indicating the absence of acid catalysis [63]. In addition, the activity of the D175A mutant toward substrates with a good leaving group (i.e. where general acid catalysis is not necessary) was increased upon addition of azide, an exogenous nucleophile, and also yielded a β-azide product. Previous studies have shown that in the absence of an acid/base residue, a small molecule such as azide can attack the intermediate with greater effect than a water molecule since the water molecule cannot be activated by the general base [94-96]. The rate of hydrolysis of O- and S-linked glycosides by the D175A mutant was also similar [63], which is consistent with acid catalysis providing no benefit for cleavage of S-linked substrates with leaving groups that have a high pKa value, but being of greater importance for corresponding O-linked substrates. The role for the polarizing residue, Asp174, acting as a general acid/base rather than as a stabilizer of the oxazolinium ion is consistent with the large change in pKa of the protonated nitrogen in the acetamido group upon changing from an amide to an oxazoline; this dramatic change in pKa, which crosses the pKa value of the polarizing residue, suggests complete proton transfer from the amide and thus formation of an oxazoline intermediate [63]. The role of the polarizing residue acting as a general acid/base, but not as a stabilizer of an oxazolinium ion, would also agree with the GH85 enzymes possessing an asparagine residue in this position; in an imidic acid form this asparagine residue would be able to accept a hydrogen bond from the nitrogen atom in the acetamido group, but as it is neutral in its resting state it is not in a position to stabilize the charge present on an oxazolium ion [85].Ideally, a three-dimensional structure of the human OGA would serve to support or challenge a number of conclusions from the mechanistic studies, offer insight into the potency of selective inhibitors of OGA, inform the design of future inhibitors against the human enzyme, and facilitate studies directed at understanding the involvement of OGA in protein-protein interactions. Despite significant and continuing efforts, OGA has not proved amenable to analysis by X-ray diffraction to date. A number of prokaryotic homologues in family GH84, however, show significant homology to the N-terminal region of OGA, which has the catalytic activity. The structures of two GH84 bacterial homologues of OGA, one from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BtGH84) [97] and the other from Clostridium perfringens (CpGH84) [98, 99] were published in 2006. The functional role of these bacterial enzymes in vivo remains unknown since prokaryotes do not have the O-GlcNAc post-translational modification, but both enzymes were shown to be capable of cleaving O-GlcNAc from proteins in cell lysates [97, 98].BtGH84 and CpGH84 display an N-terminal α/β fold domain, followed by a canonical (β/α)8 fold domain, and ending in three (in BtGH84) or one (in CpGH84) further domain(s) at the C-terminus, which are specific to only the prokaryotic enzymes (Fig. 3a) [97, 98]. The structures reveal a remarkable structural homology to the GH20 enzymes [53, 54, 56], despite a lack of sequence identity. The (β/α)8 fold domain houses the catalytic machinery in a shallow depression, and the key DD motif which comprises the residues required for catalysis, is situated at the end of β4 strand; strikingly the positioning of these key residues is identical in the GH20 enzymes. The presence of the two carboxylate residues in the active site were judged to be appropriately positioned (using complexes with inhibitors, see below for more details) to act as the key catalytic residues, consistent with previous proposals made for the human enzyme [60, 63, 70, 72]; the first of these two aspartates acts as the polarizing residue of the 2-acetamido group and the latter as the acid/base residue. Site-directed mutagenesis of the bacterial enzymes also supports assignment of these catalytic residues as discussed above [97, 98]. The active site contains two conserved tryptophan residues, which are predicted to carefully position the acetamido group, and line a sizable pocket which is capped by a cysteine (in BtGH84 and OGA, but not CpGH84) and a methionine residue [97, 98] (Fig. 3b and 3c). It is postulated that a conserved tyrosine residue is in a suitable position to stabilize the transition state during catalysis, through hydrogen bonding with the glycosidic oxygen (where partial negative charge would develop at the transition state) [98]. The structures also provided evidence, in addition to biochemical experiments [71], that these GH84 enzymes are not likely to act as hyaluronidases (as had been initially proposed [59]), as there is not sufficient room in the active site pocket to bind a substrate any larger than a monosaccharide (Fig. 3d). It is important to note that despite the relatively modest sequence similarity at the amino acid level in comparison to OGA, the important active site residues of these bacterial structures differ by only one (for BtGH84) or two (for CpGH84) residues; these structures therefore likely provide a highly accurate picture of the OGA catalytic machinery.Given the number of biological roles proposed for O-GlcNAc and the relatively early stage in our understanding of the functional roles of this common post-translational modification, inhibition of OGA has been a topic of some interest since these inhibitors can be valuable research tools. As is the case with virtually all inhibitors, high potency is a necessity that facilitates avoiding off-target effects. More of a challenge with OGA, however, has been obtaining inhibitors selective for this enzyme over the functionally related human β-hexosaminidase, which as discussed above uses the same catalytic mechanism. The design of such selective inhibitors has, however, progressed over the past few years.The vast majority of early studies in the field, carried out before design of selective inhibitors, involved increasing cellular O-GlcNAc levels using streptozotocin (N-methyl-N-nitrosoureido d-glucosamine; STZ) [100] and O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyransylidene)-amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) [101] (Fig. 4). STZ was shown to be a modest inhibitor of OGA in vitro [70, 102, 103] and has long served as a way to induce experimental type I diabetes [104] through its ability to induce apoptosis of pancreatic β -cells [105, 106]. These observations, coupled with the abundance of O-GlcNAc in β-cells, prompted the reasonable hypothesis that STZ induces apoptosis of pancreatic β -cells due to increased O-GlcNAc modification of proteins following inhibition of OGA [102, 103, 107, 108]. The mode of inhibition of OGA has been elusive, with suggestions that STZ is a suicide substrate via S-nitrosylation of a cysteine residue in the active site of the enzyme [108], or that OGA can assist in the conversion of STZ into a more potent tight binding transition state analogue [109]. A greater body of data, however, supports the ability of STZ to cause apoptosis through other means, such as free radical production (for example nitric oxide from break down of the nitroso moiety) leading to DNA damage [110, 111] and methylation of DNA [112, 113]. The apoptosis-inducing effect of STZ being ascribed to inhibition of OGA was drawn into question when comparisons by two independent groups were made with PUGNAc; both compounds caused increases in cellular O-GlcNAc levels, but only STZ caused cell death [114, 115]. Furthermore, STZ is a low millimolar inhibitor of OGA, and inhibition has been shown to be reversible and hence it is not a suicide substrate as once proposed [70, 116]. The structures of CpGH84 and BtGH84 were later solved in complex with STZ, and showed the absence of any covalent attachment with an active site cysteine residue, and also a lack of conversion into a different compound as once proposed [116, 117]. Further, a recent compelling study showed the galacto-epimer of STZ, which did not inhibit OGA or increase cellular O-GlcNAc levels, induced apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells suggesting the ability of STZ to induce apoptosis is independent of OGA and attributable to the reactive nitrosourea group [116]. The use of STZ in studies of the functional role of O-GlcNAc therefore presents obvious and serious problems and should be discouraged.Structure of OGA inhibitors discussed in the text: STZ, PUGNAc, NAG-thiazoline, NButGT, Thiamet-G, gluco-epimer of nagstatin, PUGNAc-imidazole hybrid and GlcNAcstatin C.PUGNAc is a potent inhibitor of OGA, with a Ki value of around 50 nM [46, 70, 118], but is also a potent inhibitor of the GH20 human β-hexosaminidases. PUGNAc is able to increase cellular O-GlcNAc levels by inhibiting OGA [118], and as such has been used to implicate aberrant O-GlcNAc cycling as a cause of insulin resistance [23, 119]. Interpretation of the results with this inhibitor are, however, somewhat hampered by its poor selectivity for OGA [70]. The structure of both BtGH84 and CpGH84 have been solved in complex with PUGNAc [24, 98]; in each case the N-phenylcarbamate moiety forms hydrogen bond interactions with the active site residues, including one between the exocyclic oxime nitrogen atom and the catalytic acid/base residue, and the phenyl moiety, which protrudes from the active site pocket, takes advantage of hydrophobic interactions with aromatic side chains. It is interesting to note that 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-gluconhydroximo-1,5-lactone (LOGNAc), which is similar to PUGNAc but lacks the phenyl carbamate group, is around 30 times less potent [46] demonstrating that this moiety makes an important contribution to the binding. The use of PUGNAc in studies has very recently been questioned, however, as it has been found to have a number of off-target effects; not only can it inhibit β-hexosaminidases, which leads to an increase in ganglioside levels that could impact insulin resistance [120], but it has also been shown to inhibit enzymes from other enzyme families [121] and impact cell growth [122]. The results of a study by Macauley et al. show that a highly selective inhibitor of OGA (see below) did not induce insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as PUGNAc did [24]. In addition, PUGNAc appears unable to cross the blood-brain barrier [123].Despite the prolonged use of STZ and PUGNAc as inhibitors of OGA both in vitro and in cells to induce a diabetic or insulin resistant state, it is apparent that both compounds have off-target effects and interpreting the results obtained using either compound should be done with caution. The deduction of the substrate-assisted mechanism led to the use of 1,2-dideoxy-2′-methyl-α-d-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]-Δ2′-thiazoline (NAG-thiazoline) [124] as an inhibitor of OGA [70]. This is a mimic of the oxazoline intermediate (or a closely related transition state), with a sulphur atom in place of the oxygen in the oxazoline ring, and had been shown to be a good inhibitor of GH20 enzymes which use the same mechanism [54, 124]. NAG-thiazoline inhibits OGA with a Ki value of around 70 nM, which is similar to the value measured against the human β-hexosaminidase and so, as seen with PUGNAc, this inhibitor shows little selectivity [70]. The structure of BtGH84 in complex with NAG-thiazoline, where the pyranose ring adopts a slightly distorted chair (4C1) conformation, shows a hydrogen bond interaction between Asp242 (predicted to be the polarizing residue) and the nitrogen of the thiazoline ring [97]. The issue of finding a selective inhibitor for OGA over the β-hexosaminidase was addressed in the design of a series of inhibitors where an aliphatic chain of increasing length was added to the thiazoline ring of NAG-thiazoline [70]. At the time this showed considerable foresight as the bacterial homologue structures had not yet been elucidated. The idea was based on the knowledge that the Taft-like analysis suggested the bulk of the N-acyl group may have been important for the substrate recognition in OGA, that GH20 enzymes possessed a small pocket which fitted the acetamido group snugly, and that OGA could process a chromogenic substrate bearing an azidoacetyl group [125]. Indeed, as the aliphatic chain on the thiazoline ring was increased, the inhibitors were shown to dramatically increase in selectivity for OGA over the β-hexosaminidase, with only a small penalty in the potency of the compounds, and also were able to increase cellular O-GlcNAc levels with no effect on cell growth or morphology [70]. The structural solution of two bacterial homologues of OGA later corroborated these biochemical findings, and revealed that indeed they possessed a deeper pocket into which the 2-N-acyl group protrudes [97, 98] (Fig. 3c). The observation of the thiazoline ring bearing an N-butyl chain (1,2-dideoxy-2′-propyl-α-d-glucopyranoso-[2, 1-d]-Δ2′-thiazoline; NButGT) in the active site of BtGH84 showed it bound in an identical position to NAG-thiazoline, with the acyl chain nestled in the active site pocket [126]; this compound has a Ki value against OGA of 230 nM and displays a 1500-fold selectivity over β-hexosaminidase. Efforts were made to exploit PUGNAc in a similar way with elongation of the aliphatic chain from the N-acyl moiety; there were some modest gains in selectivity for OGA over the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase, but were accompanied by a sacrifice in potency, and these compounds were significantly less potent than the thiazoline series [127, 128]. Others have also functionalized thiazoline inhibitors; a number of these also show apparent high potency coupled with good selectivity for OGA [129]. Arguably the most successful attempt to generate more potent and selective inhibitors for OGA came with the advent of 1,2-dideoxy-2′-ethylamino-α-d-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]-Δ2′-thiazoline (Thiamet-G) [130]. It was speculated that a compound in which the thiazoline ring had a higher pKa would be protonated at physiological pH (NAG-thiazoline itself has a pKa of approximately 5) and make more favourable electrostatic interactions in the active site with the carboxylate of the polarizing residue; thus a compound similar to NButGT with the substituent next to the thiazoline ring linked via a nitrogen atom was designed. It was proposed this would increase the basicity of the endocyclic nitrogen atom, as well as retain the steric considerations required for selective binding. A highly potent inhibitor resulted, with a Ki value of 21 nM and a dramatic 37,000-fold selectivity over the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase [130]. The structure of Thiamet-G in complex with BtGH84 shows that Asp242 (the key residue important for polarizing the acetamido group during catalysis) engages in favourable electrostatic interactions with both the endocyclic and exocyclic nitrogen atoms in the inhibitor (Fig. 3b); a consequence of these interactions is the subtle rearrangement of some of the active site residues which contracts the active site and draws the enzyme and inhibitor closer together [130]. Thiamet-G is capable of increasing O-GlcNAc levels in cells and in vivo, including in the brain as it is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and in addition shows greater chemical stability than the other thiazoline analogues. As such it is able to increase the level of O-GlcNAcylation on the protein tau, and thus cause a decrease in phosphorylation; an effect that may enable a better understanding of the hyperphosphorylation of this protein in various neurodegenerative diseases [130].A different approach to the development of highly potent OGA inhibitors has been based on the naturally occurring β-hexosaminidase inhibitor nagstatin [131]. Following its discovery, nagstatin was synthesized [132] and the scaffold manipulated to make potent β-glucosidase inhibitors [133, 134]. These tetrahydroimidazopyridine compounds were substituted with a number of different functional groups in order to promote favourable interactions in the active site of enzymes of interest [135-138], and these have proven to be among the most potent β-glycosidase inhibitors studied [139]. The potency of the tetrahydroimidazopyridine compounds are attributed to the protonated nitrogen atom in the imidazole forming a strong hydrogen bond interaction with the general acid/base residue, and the pseudo-glycoside ring adopting a half chair/envelope conformation which mimics the proposed oxocarbenium transition state [140]. The gluco-epimer of nagstatin inhibited OGA with a Ki value of 420 nM, but was more potent against β-hexosaminidase [141]. Subsequent development of a PUGNAc-imidazole hybrid produced a low micromolar inhibitor of human OGA. The PUGNAc-imidazole hybrid was observed by crystallography in complex with BtGH84 and when overlapped with the CpGH84 complex with PUGNAc showed the phenyl ring was forced into a position where it was more solvent exposed and made fewer interactions with the enzyme, and that the amide carbonyl was in the opposite orientation which prevented it from forming a hydrogen bond with the general acid/base residue [141]. Along similar lines, the van Aalten group designed GlcNAc-configured nagstatin derivatives (GlcNAcstatins) such as GlcNAcstatin C, which bears the tetrahydroimidazopyridine scaffold with a phenethyl functional group attached, and an isobutanamido moiety at C2. This was shown to be low picomolar inhibitor against CpGH84 [142], reported to be a 4 nM inhibitor of human OGA, and found to display 160-fold selectivity over the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase [143]. In complex with CpGH84, GlcNAcstatin C was observed in an envelope conformation and the imidazole made a hydrogen bond interaction with the general acid/base residue as predicted. The phenethyl group extended out of the active site and formed hydrophobic interactions with a tryptophan residue [142]. GlcNAcstatin D, which bears an N-propionyl group at C2, has a Ki value of 0.74 nM but only 4-fold selectivity over β-hexosaminidase; it is shown to bind in the same manner as GlcNAcstatin C [143]. Both compounds were shown to be able to increase cellular O-GlcNAc levels [142, 143].Several other unrelated inhibitors have been reported in the literature. These include alloxan, an analogue of uracil which is also capable of inhibiting OGT (see below) [144], but has some toxic effects and should therefore be used with caution [145], α-linked GlcNAc thiosulfonates, which appear to be better inhibitors of the short isoform of OGA than the full length enzyme [146], 7-membered ring azepanes [147], and an analogue of 6-epi-valienamine bearing an acetamido group [148]. The observation of two of the azepane compounds and the 6-epi-valienamine analogue in the active site of BtGH84 showed they all bound in an unusual distorted conformation which differs from their predicted conformation in solution [147, 148].The question of which glycosidase inhibitors are true mimics of the transition state has started to be addressed in recent years (for some recent examples see refs. [139, 149, 150]). Pauling first proposed in the 1940s that the highest affinity inhibitors for an enzyme would be those containing features of the transition state [151, 152]. More recently, Wolfenden demonstrated that glycoside-degrading enzymes can enhance the rate of catalysis 1017 fold over the uncatalysed reaction, making them a remarkably proficient class of enzyme [153]. If binding of a glycosidase to a transition state analogue could capture all of the binding energy proposed to be available by Wolfenden, this would translate to an estimated dissociation constant for the transition state of approximately 10−22 M, an obviously extraordinary affinity [153, 154]. Therefore if inhibitors were designed which truly mimicked the transition state, in theory a significant portion of this binding potential could be harnessed for potent inhibition. In the case of glycosidases, the widely proposed oxocarbenium ion-like transition state possesses double bond character along the C1-O5 bond causing the C1, C2, O5 and C5 atoms of the pyranose ring to lie in a plane. Accompanying this flattening of the pyranose ring would be significant positive charge delocalization along the C1-O5 bond [155, 156]. A study by Whitworth et al. addressed this issue of transition state mimicry for the OGA inhibitors PUGNAc and NAG-thiazoline using linear free energy relationships [126]. Such linear free energy relationships predict that, for a genuine transition state analogue, alterations made in the chemical structure of the substrate should perturb the transition state for the enzyme catalyzed reaction to an equivalent extent as parallel and analogous changes to a transition state analogue affect its binding to the enzyme. This can be assessed by introducing systematic changes at one position in an inhibitor and measuring the resultant Ki value, and also making the equivalent change in the substrate and determining the kcat/KM value, which reflects on the transition state structure in the first step of catalysis. Assuming these modifications do not change the mode of substrate binding or reactivity, or the rate-determining step during hydrolysis, the plot of the inverse logarithm of Ki against the inverse logarithm of kcat/KM should give a correlation with a slope equal to one, if the inhibitor is a transition state mimic [157]. The correlation for OGA was assessed using series of inhibitors and substrates which varied in the volume of the alkyl group in the N-acyl moiety at the C2 position. The resulting plots of inverse logarithm Ki against inverse logarithm kcat/KM for the NAG-thiazoline series revealed a strong correlation, with a slope of one within error, indicating that it is a true transition state mimic. A different case, however, was observed for the PUGNAc series, which showed a weaker correlation suggesting this inhibitor may be a worse transition state analogue [126]. These observations were surprising given the sp2 anomeric centre in PUGNAc would be predicted to be more ‘transition state-like’ than the sp3 centre in NAG-thiazoline, which may be considered more closely resembling the oxazoline intermediate, at least from a geometric perspective. It has been postulated this apparent anomaly may be attributable to the longer C-S bond length in the thiazoline ring of the inhibitor as compared to that of the C-O bond in the oxazoline ring of the intermediate. This increased length results in some distortion of the pyranose ring and might mimic the partial, but significant, bond order between the nucleophilic carbonyl oxygen atom and anomeric carbon of a very late transition state in which the acetamido group is heavily involved [126].Theoretical studies have also been devoted to understanding the binding of PUGNAc and NAG-thiazoline to OGA. In one such study, molecular dynamics methods were used to investigate the conformational similarities between inhibitors and a calculated transition state for the uncatalyzed formation of the oxazoline intermediate from N-acetylglucosaminides [158]. These simulations suggested that NAG-thiazoline was a poor conformational mimic of the transition state, but that GlcNAcstatin C was a better analogue of the modelled solution phase reaction. PUGNAc showed a high degree of conformational flexibility, and appeared to be only planar at C1 rather than C1 and O5 as would be likely at the transition state [158]. Electrostatic potentials have also been calculated for PUGNAc and NAG-thiazoline, and predictions made about the likely interactions with active site residues that drive binding of inhibitors suggest these may influence the design of inhibitors in the future [159].OGT was first purified from rat liver, where it was suggested to form a heterotrimer consisting of two 110 kDa subunits and one 78 kDa subunit [160]. Subsequently, the genes encoding a 110 kDa polypeptide (1046 amino acids) in rat, human, and C. elegans were cloned and the proteins over-expressed recombinantly [35, 161]. OGT is found in all tissue types, although there are at least four transcripts or isoforms in rat and human, some of which appear to be tissue-specific [35, 161, 162]; the 110 kDa polypeptide itself, however, is observed in virtually every tissue examined [161], with particularly high levels in pancreatic tissue [35]. A splice variant encoding a smaller OGT isoform has also been identified which is localized to the mitochondria [163, 164]. OGT was shown to be present, both endogenously and when transfected into cells, in the nucleus and cytoplasm; this observation is consistent with the presence of O-GlcNAc on nucleoplasmic proteins and the localization of OGA, as well as with the fact that OGT possesses a nuclear localization sequence [35, 161]. It was shown, by recombinantly expressing the 110 kDa subunit of OGT (which exists as a homotrimer [165]) in Escherichia coli, that this protein product alone was capable of modifying targets in vitro [165, 166]. OGT itself can be modified with O-GlcNAc, which may be one way in which cycling is regulated in vivo, and can also be tyrosine phosphorylated [161]. In addition it has been proposed that OGT possesses a phosphoinositide-binding region [22]. The gene encoding OGT has been shown in mammals to be vital for embryonic stem cell viability and embryonic development [2].Sequence homology has shown OGT comprises two domains; an N-terminal domain consisting of 13.5 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs (residues 1-464) [35, 161, 167, 168] and a C-terminal domain where the glycosyltransferase activity resides [165, 166]. The TPR domains likely modulate binding to a number of different protein substrates or accessory proteins [165], and have been demonstrated to interact with a variety of proteins including, for example, a histone deacetylation complex by binding to the corepressor mSin3A [169]. The TPR motif is found as a domain in many proteins, and appears to be ubiquitous through many organisms and cellular locations [167]. These repeats play an important role in modulating protein-protein interactions in a range of cellular processes including protein transport, transcription and cell cycle control [167, 168, 170]. The TPR motif itself consists of a 34 amino acid repeat, which contains eight residues throughout the sequence that are highly conserved, and the rest tend to be highly consistent in residue ‘type’ [167, 168]. The TPR motifs are often found in serial arrays having a different number of repeats (usually between 3 and 16), which structurally form a superhelix that is responsible for mediating the interactions with other proteins. The helix has a concave face which presents the precise binding residues defined in the overall structure to the target in a specific fashion [168]. It is likely to be the number of repeats, and hence the size of the TPR groove(s) generated, that determines the number of different protein targets with which the TPR domains can interact [167]. Consistent with the presence of so many TPR domains on OGT, numerous binding partners of OGT have been proposed [169, 171-175]. Interestingly, OGT does not appear to recognize a consensus sequence directing modification of target proteins, although a preference for Pro-Val-Ser-Thr and Thr-Thr-Ala has been proposed based on proteomics studies in which several O-GlcNAc sites were identified on a number of different proteins [33]. Systematic amino acid variation of residues surrounding an O-GlcNAc site on an α-crystalline peptide has also suggested OGT has some modest preferences for particular residues at certain positions [176]. The TPR domains have also been found to play a role in the activity of OGT. The deletion of a number of the TPR domains from the N-terminal end of OGT demonstrated that some, but not all, were required for enzymatic transfer of O-GlcNAc onto peptides; those missing the first three or six TPR domains had full activity but this region aided trimerization of OGT, whereas those missing the first nine or eleven TPR domains were catalytically inactive [165]. Lubas and Hanover report a difference in the activity with TPR deletion mutants between peptide and protein substrates, although they appear to have used the mitochondrial OGT which has only nine TPR domains. They found that while the N-terminal deletion of the the three most N-terminal TPR domains resulted in an enzyme having unchanged OGT activity on peptide substrates, OGT activity of the same construct measured using nucleoporin p62 (np62) as a substrate was impaired, suggesting these TPR domains are involved in substrate recognition [166]. In a different study, the interaction of OGT (110 kDa polypeptide) with the interaction domain (OID) of OIP106 (OGT-interacting protein, 106 kDa [177]) was investigated. If OGT was missing the most N-terminal 5.5 TPR domains it was unable to interact with OID (and was catalytically inactive), whereas if it was missing only the first 2.5 TPR domains it was still able to bind, yet remained catalytically impaired [171]. Recombinantly expressed and purified TPR domains of OGT alone were capable of inhibiting OID glycosylation by competing for the same binding site on OGT; the same is not true, however, for a peptide substrate, which reaffirms the role of the TPR domains as a docking or binding domain [171]. In addition, OID and np62 also compete with each other in in vitro glycosylation assays using OGT [171]. More recently, an appealing hypothesis has emerged that OGT may also be positively regulated through its interaction with other protein partners such as PGC1-α [175], mSin3A [169], myosin phosphatasetargeting subunit 1 [173], co-activator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 [173], OIP106 [177] and p38 MAP kinase [178].OGT is classified into family GT41 of the CAZy system [51], which it currently shares with around 270 prokaryotic sequences and 70 other eukaryotic sequences. OGT catalyzes glycosyl transfer with inversion of stereochemistry to generate the β-O-GlcNAc linkage to serine and threonine residues of substrate proteins. The amino acid sequence identity of human OGT with OGT proteins from other higher eukaryotes is very high (>95%), but much lower when compared with prokaryotic sequences encoding related proteins (around 35-40% at most). Mechanistic studies of OGT lag behind those of OGA and related homologues, which reflects the nature of the carbohydrate enzyme field in general [179, 180]. Primarily, the relative lack of knowledge about glycosyltransferases stems from the fact that many of these enzymes are larger in size than hydrolases and/or membrane bound, which makes them harder to express recombinantly, characterize, and crystallize for structural studies. In addition, the availability of small molecule tools or probes, such as synthetic substrates and inhibitors, is more limited for the glycosyltransferases.The Leloir donor substrate of OGT is uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) [34], which is the end product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. It is estimated that 2-3% of the total incoming glucose to the cell is diverted from catabolism into this pathway to form UDP-GlcNAc [181]. OGT shows an optimum catalytic activity at pH 6, but below pH 6 and above pH 7.5 enzyme activity decreases significantly [160]. Unlike many other glycosyltransferases, OGT does not require the presence of a divalent metal ion for efficient catalysis [34, 160]. Early kinetic studies of OGT revealed unusual Michaelis-Menten kinetics for this enzyme. When using UDP-GlcNAc and a peptide substrate containing an endogenous O-GlcNAc-modifiable site, no saturation was observed and three KM values for UDP-GlcNAc were reported (6, 35, and 217 μM). In addition, it was observed that OGT had a different affinity for peptide substrates at different UDP-GlcNAc concentrations, suggesting that UDP-GlcNAc levels can differentially modulate the affinity OGT has for different peptide acceptor sites [165]. Others, however, have observed that when a protein such as np62 is used as the acceptor, only one KM for UDP-GlcNAc is observed (KM for UDP-GlcNAc of 0.5 μM; KM for np62 of 1.2 μM); these kinetics appear to have reported on the mitochondrial OGT however, and so a direct comparison may not be entirely appropriate [166]. The use of a whole protein substrate rather than a peptide may, however, be more physiologically relevant since the natural substrates of OGT in vivo are intact proteins. Dissection of the kinetic parameters on OGT using a peptide substrate suggested the enzyme used a random bi-bi mechanism [165]. Further studies are needed to provide greater insight into the mechanisms by which OGT recognizes and acts to modify its protein substrates.Full length human OGT has, to date, eluded crystallization and structure solution. Efforts to realize the structure of OGT are a topic of intense current interest and a structure would significantly aid attempts at dissecting the mechanistic details and perhaps aid inhibitor design. Jínek and coworkers, however, were able to solve the structure of the TPR domains from OGT [182], which has offered some insight into the molecular basis for substrate binding and recognition (Fig. 5c). The crystallized protein lacked the catalytic domain and consisted of 11.5 out of the 13.5 TPR domains (residues 16-400) of OGT. This protein construct was shown to contain the region responsible for recognition of np62, as demonstrated by competition assays with the full length OGT. The TPR domains form a homodimer (which differs from the trimeric state proposed for full length OGT [165]) of right-handed superhelices. Each TPR domain consists of two antiparallel helices, which possess the hydrophobic residues in conserved positions as seen in other proteins containing TPR motifs [182]. The convex face of the superhelices is responsible for dimerization and this process is mediated primarily by hydrophobic interactions; mutation of a tryptophan and isoleucine which appear to be important for this dimerization causes the TPR domains to appear monomeric by size exclusion chromatography (whereas the wild type TPR domains run at a mass consistent with being dimeric) [182]. The majority of the conserved surface exposed residues line the inner concave surface of the superhelix; in particular the central part of the groove is mostly lined with asparagine residues, which form a continuous ‘ladder’ through the superhelix [182]. These conserved asparagine residues on the inner surface of the superhelix bear a marked similarity to the ARM-repeat proteins importin-α and β - catenin; in these proteins the asparagine residues are important for recognition of their target peptides and form bidentate hydrogen bonds with the protein main chain of the substrate [183-185] (Fig. 5d). It may be possible that different pockets of the TPR domains of OGT recognise and bind to different protein substrates; if this is the case the asparagine residues may be important in forming the interaction, but it is likely to be the neighbouring residues that confer specificity [182].Three-dimensional structure of a bacterial homologue of OGT. (a) Cartoon representation of XcGT41 in complex with a C1 phosphonate analogue of UDP-GlcNAc (PDB 2JLB [187]). The active site lies at the interface of the two (α/β)-fold domains which make up the GT-B topology. (b) Ball-and-stick representation of the active site of XcGT41 in complex with a C1 phosphonate analogue of UDP-GlcNAc, and where significant differences arise XcGT41 in complex with UDP (PDB 2VSN [186]). His218 has been proposed to be the catalytic base by Martinez-Fleites et al. [186], but lies in a different position in the two complexes. (c) Cartoon and surface representation of the dimeric TPR domains from OGT (PDB 1W3B [182]); the TPR domains are a homodimer of right-handed superhelices. (d) Cartoon and surface representation of importin-α in complex with a nuclear localization sequence (PDB 1EE4 [185]), which has been suggested to have a similar mode of binding to the TPR domains. The asparagine residues on the inner surface of the superhelix have been shown to be important for recognition of their target sequences. Figs. (a) and (b) were drawn using MOLSCRIPT [194] and (c) and (d) using PYMOL (https://www.pymol.org).Despite the lack of a full length OGT structure, there are prokaryotic homologues in GT41 which show significant homology to OGT and, in particular, the C-terminal domain. The structure of a GT41 bacterial homologue of OGT from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestis (XcGT41), which has 36% sequence identity to the human enzyme, was published last year by two independent groups [186, 187]. The substrates of the bacterial enzymes are as yet unknown, but it was shown that, like OGT, XcGT41 was able to catalyze the transfer of UDP-GlcNAc to water in vitro [186]. No activity of XcGT41 was detected towards human or bacterial cell lysates or synthetic peptides, but the enzyme may be able to modify a protein in Arabidopsis thaliana cell lysates with O-GlcNAc [187]. The structure reveals that XcGT41 comprises an N-terminal domain consisting of 5.5 TPR domains, and a C-terminal catalytic domain which displays the GT-B topology of glycosyltransferases (Fig. 5a). The GT-B topology comprises two (α/β)-fold domains, between which the UDP-GlcNAc binds; these observations are consistent with previous predictions for this enzyme [188, 189]. The bacterial enzymes, however, lack a 120 amino acid insertion between the two domains at the N- and C-terminus of the GT-B fold, which appears in all mammalian sequences [186, 187]. The structure of XcGT41 in complex with UDP revealed the likely residues which are important for binding of the nucleotide-phosphate donor, and these were highly conserved in the eukaryotic sequences. Systematic mutation of these residues in human OGT support the structural model and revealed residues important for binding UDP-GlcNAc as well as those that are necessary for catalytic activity [186, 187] (Fig. 5b). In addition, a histidine residue (His558 in human OGT, which is equivalent to His218 in XcGT41) was identified as the likely general base for catalysis [186], based on both the fact that when deleted there is no activity, and by structural homology to other glycosyltransferases having the GT-B fold for which this role has been assigned [190]; Clarke et al. suggest the base may be a tyrosine residue, however, and a histidine residue may be important for stabilization of the leaving group [187]. Glycosyltransferases that catalyze transfer with inversion of stereochemistry are believed to use a dissociative SN2-like mechanism; an enzymic residue acts as a general base to deprotonate the nucleophile of the acceptor, which facilitates displacement of the activated nucleotide-phosphate leaving group. In a number of glycosyltransferases for which the three-dimensional structure has been elucidated, the general base is predicted to be a histidine, which interacts with an adjacent aspartate or glutamate residue [190]. Further studies will be required to clarify the identities of the catalytic residues and their roles in OGT. Notably, the structure of XcGT41 also reveals an unusual and intimate relationship between the TPR domains and the C-terminal glycosyltransferase domain. The last TPR motif is atypical, which allows a large contact area with the enzymatic domain and orients the catalytic domain to enable the superhelical groove of the TPR domains to be continuous with the active site cleft [186, 187], suggesting that substrates binding to the TPR domains may be positioned within the groove to be exposed to the catalytic machinery.While the design of potent and selective inhibitors for OGA has flourished in recent years, unfortunately the same cannot be said for OGT. However, the advent of the structure of a bacterial homologue of OGT may aid efforts. It has long been established that UDP, UDP-GlcNAc, and UTP are potent (around 200 nM) inhibitors of OGT [160] (Fig. 6). In addition, alloxan, a uracil analogue, was also demonstrated to be an OGT inhibitor, with complete inhibition at 1 mM and half of the maximum inhibition at 0.1 mM; the mechanism for inhibition is unclear, however, and alloxan may disrupt cysteine residues rather than bind in place of UDP-GlcNAc [191]. Sophisticated high throughput studies have been performed with the smaller splice variant of OGT, which can be over-expressed recombinantly in higher yield than the full length protein, in order to find potent inhibitors. Compounds were screened using a fluorescent UDP-GlcNAc analogue displacement assay, which led to the exciting discovery of three structurally unrelated compounds that inhibit OGT [192]. It is, as yet, unknown if these inhibitors act in vivo, but if so, they could prove to be a useful tool to decrease O-GlcNAc levels and study the physiological role of O-GlcNAc. These molecules are poorly water soluble but generation of derivatives having improved physical properties should be feasible. Others have explored a C1 phosphonate analogue of UDP-GlcNAc as an inhibitor of OGT, but this proved to be a poor inhibitor with an IC50 of more than 5 mM, suggesting the presence of the glycosidic oxygen in UDP-GlcNAc is important [193]. Despite the poor affinity, this compound was successfully soaked into crystals of XcGT41; the solution of the structure in complex with the inhibitor compared to the apo-structure showed that a loop was positioned differently in each suggesting this loop may act as an ‘active site lid’ [187].Structure of OGT inhibitors discussed in the text: UDP-GlcNAc, alloxan, three compounds identified from high throughput screening, and a C1 phosphonate analogue of UDP-GlcNAc.This review has demonstrated that work involving the O-GlcNAc processing enzymes is highly active at present and reflects the research efforts of a number of groups. There is, however, still a number of unanswered questions. Despite the apparent simplicity of having only one enzyme for the addition and one enzyme for the removal of O-GlcNAc, the system of regulation and substrate specificity may be highly complex. These two enzymes are responsible for the O-GlcNAc cycling on hundreds of nucleocytoplasmic proteins, in the absence of a clear consensus sequence. Some regulatory mechanism is presumably in place to prevent futile O-GlcNAc cycling in vivo, but this is not yet understood, nor are the precise roles of the addition of this small sugar molecule to proteins. In addition it would be interesting to address why prokaryotes possess enzymes homologous to OGA and OGT, yet do not appear to have the O-GlcNAc modification of proteins; presumably they have gained (and retained) the genes encoding these proteins from the their eukaryotic hosts for some, as yet unexplained, reasons.The OGA field has flourished in recent years, with the deduction of the catalytic mechanism, the generation of highly potent and selective inhibitors, and the solution of the structures of two bacterial homologues of this enzyme. The question remains, however, of the role played by the C-terminal region of OGA which is absent in the bacterial sequences. Although it has been suggested this region has the ability to acetylate histones, this function has not been related to its OGA activity, and one cannot help but think it might also play another role; particularly since confirmation of this activity has proven elusive. In addition, the structures have not really aided in the knowledge of how the protein substrate is recognised or binds to OGA, which may be useful for understanding how this enzyme is capable of modifying such a wide array of substrates. Ultimately the structure of the human OGA may address both of these questions.Studies of OGT do lag behind those of OGA, which unfortunately reflects the general situation of glycosyltransferases vs. glycoside hydrolases. The solution of the structure of a bacterial homologue very recently, however, should now drive the field forward in the quest for a more detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism and could aid design of potent inhibitors. Potent and selective inhibitors, such as those that have now been developed for OGA, will be an invaluable tool to use in cells to alter O-GlcNAc levels, which will ultimately aid elucidation of the way the enzyme works and is regulated.T.

PMC2856279,"Identification, Characterization, and Biosynthesis of a Novel N-Glycan Modification in the Fruiting Body of the Basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea*",False,"Coprinopsis cinerea is a model organism for fruiting body development in homobasidiomycetes. Here, we focused on N-linked oligosaccharides (NLO) of cell wall proteins in the hyphae of two developmental stages, vegetative mycelium and fruiting body. High mannose-type glycans were the most commonly found structures. In addition, we observed a novel glycan, predominantly present in fruiting body. This oligosaccharide structure was of the high mannose type with at least five mannoses and a bisecting α1–4 N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at the β-mannose of the N-glycan core. The transferase responsible for this modification, CcGnt1 (C. cinerea GlcNAc transferase 1), was identified and expressed in insect cells. In vitro activity of CcGnt1 was demonstrated. This novel glycosyltransferase belongs to the glycosyltransferase family 8 (GT8) and is predicted to be a type II membrane protein. Expression of the CcGnt1 locus was up-regulated in fruiting body, but down-regulation of expression by means of RNAi decreased the level of bisected NLO; however had no apparent effect on fruiting body formation.N-Linked protein glycosylation is present in all domains of life and has two characteristics in common: the oligosaccharide is preassembled on a lipid carrier and is then transferred en bloc to an asparagine residue within the consensus sequence (N-X-(S/T)) of the protein. The composition of the oligosaccharide differs between bacteria and eukaryotes. Eukaryotic glycans are built on a chitobiose core (two N-acetylglucosamine, GlcNAc)3 that is further modified with mannoses (1). Higher eukaryotes share a conserved structure with two GlcNAc, nine mannoses, and three glucoses. After the initial trimming of the N-linked oligosaccharide (NLO) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the structure and function of the glycans diverge in different eukaryotes. In animals, extensive remodeling by glycosylhydrolases (GH) and glycosyltransferases (GT) can lead to three classes of N-glycan: high mannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type. The combination of various monosaccharides, such as GlcNAc, galactose, fucose, and sialic acid, differently substituted and linked yields hundreds of protein-linked glycoforms. Plants do also have highly modified glycans, less complex and without sialic acid, but with the characteristic β1–2 xylose modification at the core mannose and α1–3 fucose at the innermost GlcNAc of the chitobiose core (2).The glycan processing in the Golgi apparatus of fungi is less well studied but seems to be simpler. In the ascomycetous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, high mannose-type oligosaccharides are not trimmed but elongated on a newly introduced branch with up to 200 mannoses (3, 4). In filamentous ascomycetes this outer chain mannosylation is less pronounced; instead galactofuranose is found attached to the middle branch of the high mannose sugar and α1–2 mannoses can be trimmed (5).In basidiomycetes, investigation of N-glycan modification in Golgi was only recently approached using bioinformatic tools. Surprisingly, no homologs to equivalent Golgi-glycosyltransferases present in other eukaryotes were found to be encoded in four genomes of homobasidiomycetes, Coprinopsis cinerea, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Laccaria bicolor, and Schizophyllum commune (6) and one heterobasidiomycete, Ustilago maydis (7). On the other hand, up to seven putative Golgi-localized mannosidases were identified in the genome of the homobasidiomycetes, and mannosidase activity was identified in S. commune (6).In this study, we characterized N-glycans of cell wall proteins from vegetative mycelium and young fruiting bodies of the homobasidiomycete C. cinerea. High mannose-type structures with five to nine mannoses were identified predominantly, but an additional glycan, characterized as a high mannose-type glycan with a bisecting α1–4 GlcNAc at the β-mannose was isolated from fruiting bodies. The GlcNAc transferase responsible for this modification was identified, termed CcGnt1, and its activity was confirmed by both in vivo and in vitro experiments.Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for cloning and amplification of plasmids. Transformation-competent cells were prepared as described previously (8). Plasmid-containing bacteria were selected at 37 °C on Luria broth containing 100 mg of ampicillin/liter. S. cerevisiae laboratory strain W303–1A (MATa ura3–1 trp1–1 his3–11, 15 leu2–3, 112 ade2–1 can1–100) was used for cloning by homologous recombination. Transformants generated by the LiOAc method (9) were selected at 30 °C on synthetic complete medium without uracil (10). C. cinerea strain AmutBmut (A43mut B43mut pab1.2) (11, 12) was used for all Coprinopsis experiments. The transformation of mononucleate asexual C. cinerea spores (oidia) with the RNAi constructs was described previously (13). Selection for transformants was done on minimal medium (MM). Primordia (referred to as fruiting bodies in this report) of strain AmutBmut were produced by precultivating vegetative mycelium on cellophane disks on YMG plates for 4 days (triple inocula) at 37 °C in darkness (in ventilated closed black boxes) and subsequent transferral to 25 °C in a 12-h light/dark regime for another 3 days (resulting in secondary hyphal knots and primordia of up to 2 mm in diameter) and up to 10 days, respectively. The size of harvested primordia was 4–10 mm. Oidia for transformation and DNA isolation were produced by transferring vegetative mycelium grown on YMG (AmutBmut) without cellophane disks at 37 °C for 3 days in darkness (triple inocula) into constant white light (20 to 25 μE per m2 and s; emission spectrum of 275 to 780 nm) and incubation at 37 °C for another 4 and 5 days, respectively.CcGnt1 was amplified from genomic DNA of AmutBmut, because the coding sequence is not interrupted by any introns. The sequence in AmutBmut was identical to the one of the strain okayama7 no. 130 and can be retrieved from GenBankTM (AACS01000037.1 286227-287411). The primer pair NTF_GnT1fwd/NTF_GnT1rev was used for PCR amplification, the product was cloned into pGem-T Easy Vector System (Promega), amplified in E. coli and sequenced. The DNA encoding the open reading frame without the start codon was subcloned into pFASTBAC vector (Invitrogen) for insect cell expression cleaved with the restriction endonucleases NarI and HindIII. The ATG start codon and an N-terminal sequence encoding for the FLAG tag were included on the plasmid.The RNAi construct was built by homologous recombination in yeast with linearized plasmid (no. 359, Ref. 14) and the two PCR fragments (sense and antisense) amplified with primer pair RNAi_GnT1sfwd/RNAi_GnT1srev1 and RNAi_GnT1asfwd1/RNAi_GnT1asrev as described in Ref. 14. NTF_GnT1fwd (GGCGCCTGGCCGACCAATACTAGACCG); NTF_GnT1rev (AAGCTTTCACCTCGTCGGCCAAC); RNAi_GnT1sfwd (GTATCACCAGTCTAACATCCCGCGGTGGGCCGACCAATACTAGAC); RNAi_GnT1srev1 (TCTCTTGAATTCTCTTGAATTTGGAACGCCATCATCTTCAAG); RNAi_GnT1asfwd1 (TTCAAGAGAATTCAAGAGATTTGGAACGCCATCATCTTCAAG); RNAi_GnT1asrev (GGGGGAGCAATCCATGGACACTAGTTGGGCCGACCAATACTAGAC).50 mg of lyophilized material (either vegetative mycelium or fruiting body primordia) was powdered with glass beads in the Fast-Prep machine (Bio 101 Savant; Savant Instruments, Inc., Holbrook, NY) and the protocol established by Schulz and Aebi (15) was followed to enrich for cell wall-linked proteins. N-Glycans were then released with 500 units of either PNGase F (NEB; 500 units/μl) or Endo H (NEB; 500 units/μl) overnight at 37 °C. The supernatant and two consecutive washes of the pellet were pooled, subjected to cleanup, and 2-AB labeling (see below) (16).The extract was passed over C18- (Sep-Pak Cartridges C18; Waters) and graphitized carbon columns (Supelclean ENVI-Carb SPE bulk packing; Supelco) for purification: the two columns were first washed twice with 1 ml of acetonitrile, then equilibrated twice with 2% acetonitrile in H2O. The extract was then applied to the C18 column, the tube was washed with 2% acetonitrile, and passed through the column. The flow-through was loaded onto the carbon column and washed three times with 2% acetonitrile. NLO were eluted twice with 200 μl of 50% acetonitrile in H2O, dried in a Speedvac (Savant AES 1000) and subjected to 2-AB-labeling (2-AB: 2-aminobenzamide (Aldrich; anthranilamide)(17). Excess label was removed using Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filters (UFC30LH25, Millipore) supported by two paper discs (3 mm Chr, chromatography paper; Whatman). The columns were sequentially pretreated with twice 450 μl of 30% glacial acetic acid (J. T. Baker), ddH2O, 100% acetonitrile (J.T. Baker), and 95% acetonitrile. The labeling reaction was stopped by addition of acetonitrile to a final concentration of 95%. The reaction was loaded onto the column, and the columns were washed eight times with 95% acetonitrile in H2O. Elution was by centrifugation with ddH2O.Glycans were resuspended in 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 5) for α-mannosidase (Jack Bean, Sigma M7257; ∼20 units/mg) treatment, in 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.5) for β-HexNAc'ase (Jack Bean, Sigma; ∼50 units/mg) treatment, in 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 5) for double digest with α-mannosidase and β-HexNAc'ase and in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) for α1–2 mannosidase treatment (Trichoderma reesei, a gift from R. Contreras, Gent). 1 μl of enzyme was used in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Glycans were desalted and purified from enzymes with a small scale carbon column as described below.SF9 cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Grace's insect cell culture medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 6-well plates (TPP, Switzerland) at 28 °C. Two million cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus either containing pFASTBAC vector control (Invitrogen) or pFASTBAC-N-terminal FLAG-CcGnt1 according to the manufacturer's instructions and grown for 3 days. Cells were then lysed with shaking (4 °C, 15 min) in 150 μl of Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) containing 2% (w/v) Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Complete EDTA-free). The lysis mixture was centrifuged (2000 × g, 5 min), the postnuclear supernatant was recovered (raw extract), and used for all further enzymatic studies.Enzymatic activity toward appropriate carbohydrates was assessed using 2 μl of raw extract in a 5-μl final volume of MES buffer (pH 6.5, 40 μm) containing manganese(II) chloride (10 μm), UDP-GlcNAc (1 mm) and the acceptor glycan, prepared from RNAseB (Sigma) by release of the glycan with PNGase (NEB), followed by digestion with α1–2-mannosidase. Glycosylation reactions were typically run for 16 h at room temperature. For donor specificity analysis, UDP-GlcNAc was replaced by equal concentrations of UDP-GalNAc. For cofactor specificity analysis, MnCl2 was replaced by equal concentrations of MgCl2 or Na2EDTA. Products were desalted and purified from proteins with a small scale carbon column as described below. Analysis of the reaction product was performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.For MS analysis, samples were purified by an additional carbon column. The small scale, self-made column was prepared as follows: a 200-μl pipette tip was filled with glass wool, and 100 μl of carbon suspension (Supelco, in methanol) was added. The column was washed twice with 200 μl of acetonitrile, equilibrated twice with 200 μl of 2% acetonitrile. The sample was loaded, and the column was washed twice with 200 μl of 2% acetonitrile before eluting twice with 50% acetonitrile. The eluate was dried and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, spotted on a MALDI plate and covered with matrix (10 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma), 70% acetonitrile, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). MALDI-TOF-MS and MS/MS were performed with ABI 4800 MALDI TOF/TOFTM (Applied Biosystems Inc.).Real-time PCR was carried out by using a SensiMixTMPlus SYBR® (QUANTACE) with 0.9 μm forward and reverse primer concentrations each and a variable amount of cDNA (20–0.02 ng per reaction) in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. Thermocycling was performed in a Rotor-Gene 3000 Real-Time Thermal Cycler (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia) initiated by a 14-min incubation at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Fluorescence data were acquired during the elongation step in every cycle. Each run was completed with a melting curve analysis to confirm specificity of amplification and absence of primer dimers. The amplification of genomic DNA was prevented by DNase digestion during RNA extraction and monitored by including a cDNA control, where reverse transcriptase was omitted. benA (tubulin) expression was detected with the primers 5′- GTCATGTCCGGTATCACCAC-3′ and 5′-GGGAAAGGAACCATGTTGA-3′ served as a reference gene for the relative quantification of CcGnt1 and CcGnt2, which were detected with the primers CcGnt1-fwd 5′-ACCAAAATGGATGCTTCACC-3′, CcGnt1-rev 5′-GATTGAGAGGCCTGAGATGC-3′ and CcGnt2-fwd 5′-GAGGCGACGCTTACTACTGG-3′, CcGnt2-rev 5′- GGTCCGAGTCCATAACGATG- 3′, respectively. PCR efficiencies were determined with serial dilutions of cDNA. Transcript quantification of individual samples was based on measurements in triplicate and analysis using the mathematical model of Pfaffl (18).To describe the NLO in C. cinerea, the cell wall was chosen as the source enriched in glycosylated proteins (15). The fact that cell wall proteins can be covalently attached to the polysaccharide scaffold was exploited to enrich for glycoproteins prior to enzymatic release of the NLO by peptide: N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). Purified and 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB)-derivatized glycan were subsequently analyzed by MALDI-MS. In both, mycelium and fruiting body, we identified glycans with masses corresponding to two N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc) and five to nine Hex units (Fig. 1, A and B; m/z: 1377, 1539, 1701, 1863, 2025). Treating the preparation with α1–2 mannosidase reduced the complexity of the spectra, and we observed a predominant glycan in mycelium-derived samples with a mass of m/z = 1377 (Fig. 1C). Based on the knowledge concerning biosynthesis and early processing of N-glycans in the ER (19) we concluded that these masses correspond to high mannose-type glycans (Fig. 1G). The different glycans detected were probably generated by the trimming of the ER oligosaccharide GlcNAc2Man8–9 to GlcNAc2Man5 by Golgi α1–2 mannosidases, as found to be the case in other filamentous fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus (20). In fruiting body-derived preparations, an additional series of oligosaccharides, differing from the high mannose series by the mass of one additional HexNAc unit appeared in the spectra (Fig. 1B; m/z: 1580, 1742, 1904). Digestion of glycans by α1–2 mannosidase again reduced complexity of the spectra and gave the GlcNAc2Man5 oligosaccharide (m/z 1377) as in the mycelium sample, but in addition two oligosaccharides appeared: a putative GlcNAc2Man5HexNAc and a putative GlcNAc2Hex8 oligosaccharide. Additional treatment of the sample by α-mannosidase resulted in a further trimming and yielded a GlcNAc2Man (m/z 729; derived from GlcNAc2Man5), a GlcNAc2ManHexNAc (m/z 932) and a GlcNAc2Hex5 (m/z 1377; Fig. 1E). These structures were resistant to treatment by β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (β-HexNAc'ase; Fig. 1F). We confirmed that β-N-acetylhexosaminidase was fully active under the conditions used because commercially available hybrid-type glycans with bisecting β-GlcNAc was processed by the enzyme (supplemental Fig. S1). We concluded that the novel series of glycans appearing in the fruiting body were modified with an α-HexNAc bisecting the structure at the core mannose and that oligosaccharides with (glucosylated) A-branch were also present in the preparations from fruiting bodies (Fig. 1G). A hexose attached to the A-branch protected the two α-mannoses from degradation by the enzyme. Based on biosynthetic information, we speculated that this hexose was glucose that was not removed by the processing glucosidase II in the ER.N-Glycan profile of C. cinerea cell wall proteins. N-Linked glycans were enzymatically released by PNGase F from cell wall proteins of C. cinerea, purified, derivatized, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The spectra in A and B were obtained from analyzing extracts of mycelium and fruiting body, respectively. Vertical numbers indicate the peak mass, and selected peaks are labeled with an index (n) in bold, representing high mannose-type glycans of the composition 2-AB-GlcNAc2Hexn. Bold masses in B emphasize peaks appearing in fruiting body that were not detected in mycelium sample. In C and D, samples derived from mycelium and fruiting body, respectively, were digested with α1–2 mannosidase from T. reesei. To characterize the glycan profile further, fruiting body derived extract was either treated with Jack Bean α-mannosidases (E) or with α-mannosidases in combination with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (β-HexNAc'ase) (F). Putative structures of N-linked glycans present in cell wall in G.Importantly, the high mannose oligosaccharide with an additional HexNAc were not obtained by treating the cell wall preparation of fruiting bodies with Endo H (Fig. 2A), but subsequent treatment of the cell wall preparation by PNGase F released the GlcNAc-containing oligosaccharides. We concluded that the fruiting body specific bisecting α-linked GlcNAc modification inhibited Endo H activity. Such an inhibition does not occur for glycans that are bisected with β-GlcNAc, structures commonly found on mammalian N-glycoproteins such as ovalbumin (21).Novel glycan structure is resistant to Endo H. Cell wall protein from fruiting body extract was consecutively treated with Endo H, followed by PNGase F. The released N-glycans were purified, labeled with 2-AB, and analyzed with MALDI-MS. In A, the MALDI-TOF spectrum of glycans released by Endo H is shown. Peaks are labeled with mass (vertical) and indices n (bold) belonging to 2-AB-GlcNAc1Hexn. B shows the spectrum for PNGase F-released glycans from cell wall subsequent to Endo H treatment. In black, masses and indices correspond to 2-AB-GlcNAc2HexnHexNAc; in gray to 2-AB-GlcNAc2Hexn.Genes homologous to the GlcNAc-transferases of higher eukaryotes (GnT) (22) were not identified using homology searches (by the BLAST algorithm) against the Coprinopsis genome (Broad Institute Coprinopsis Database). Instead five loci related to the GlcNAc transferases from the ascomycetous yeasts S. cerevisiae (24) and Kluyveromyces lactis (25) were found. This glycosyltransferase was first identified in K. lactis in a screen for mutant strains with altered mannan biosynthesis (26). In this report, a terminal α1–2 GlcNAc was found on the outer chain of mannoproteins. The genes, called Gnt1, code for glycosyltransferases of the family 8 (GT8), as classified by the CaZY data base (27). GT8 members are retaining transferases that add various monosaccharides from nucleotide activated substrates in α-conformation to various acceptors (28). Aligning all fungal GT8 proteins listed in the CaZY data base, together with the five orthologs found in C. cinerea, and performing a phylogenetic analysis allowed us to identify a group of putative glycosyltransferases that included the yeast Gnt1 as well as putative orthologs from ascomycetes. Interestingly, two closely related putative proteins in C. cinerea, denominated CcGnt1 and CcGnt2 (C. cinerea GlcNAc transferase 1 and 2), were present in this group (Fig. 3A). The two putative C. cinerea Gnt proteins consist of 394 and 324 amino acid residues, respectively, and are 51% identical in sequence. Like the yeast ortholog, they are predicted to be type II membrane protein, typical for Golgi glycosyltransferases. To evaluate the hypothesis that one of these transferases was responsible for the N-glycan modification observed in fruiting body cell wall protein, transcript levels of CcGnt1 and CcGnt2 were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with RNA extracted from either vegetative mycelium or fruiting body. CcGnt1 was found to be up-regulated in fruiting body, whereas CcGnt2 mRNA levels were found to be the same in both developmental stages (Fig. 3B). Therefore, CcGnt1 was amplified from genomic DNA and the corresponding protein, marked with an N-terminal FLAG-tag, was expressed in a baculovirus expression system. Extracts derived from insect cells containing the expression construct revealed a clear signal in immunoblots obtained after SDS/PAGE and subsequent probing with anti-FLAG antiserum (Fig. 4, lane 2). Treatment of the extract with PNGase F prior to SDS/PAGE resulted in a slightly increased mobility of the tagged protein, consistent with the presence of a single N-glycosylation site in the protein (Fig. 4, lane 3). To evaluate glycosyltransferase activity of CcGnt1, crude extracts of CcGnt1-expressing and control insect cells were tested. 2-AB-labeled GlcNAc2Man5 oligosaccharide and UDP- GlcNAc were used as substrates. Product analysis was done by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Crude extract of insect cells expressing CcGnt1 but not the control extract was able to transfer GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to 2-AB-GlcNAc2Man5 in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 5A). The addition of Mn2+ as cofactor in the reaction was crucial for the transfer, because in the presence of Mg2+ ions, the substrate turnover was incomplete, and the reaction was totally inhibited by depleting divalent cations from the extract with EDTA (Fig. 5B). Using UDP-GalNAc as alternative donor did not result in any transfer (Fig. 5C), supporting the conclusion that CcGnt1 indeed is a GlcNAc transferase. We analyzed the in vitro reaction product in more detail. MS/MS fragmentation of permethylated in vitro produced glycan further provided strong evidence for addition of the GlcNAc to the 4 position on the β-mannose. The ions relevant for structure interpretation are found in the spectrum in Fig. 5D and are schematically represented in the Haworth projection. The Y1 ion, one GlcNAc with the 2-AB label, indicated that the reducing-end GlcNAc was not further substituted. The C2 ion revealed the presence of a GlcNAc molecule attached to the mannose. Together, those two ions provided good evidence for the additional GlcNAc to be linked to the β-mannose rather than to the chitobiose core. Because position 3 and 6 of the β-mannose are normally substituted by mannoses, only position 2 and 4 remained for the GlcNAc modification. The cross ring fragment 2,4A2 ion was indicative for the 1–4 linkage.Yeast Gnt1 homologues as candidates for the transferase activity in fruiting body. A, phylogenetic analysis of fungal members of the GT8-family found in CaZY data base (27). Shown here, the clade of the yeast Gnt1's (24, 25) and two homologs of C. cinerea.

B, relative mRNA levels of CcGnt1 and CcGnt2 in vegetative mycelium and fruiting body. mRNA isolated from mycelium and fruiting body of C. cinerea was used for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of these two developmental states. CcGnt1 is differentially expressed, but CcGnt2 is not. The error bars represent the standard deviation of three experimental replicates.Immunoblot analysis of CcGnt1 expression in insect cells. Protein crude extract of SF9 cells was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. FLAG-tagged CcGnt1 was detected using monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. Protein extract of cells transfected with the vector control (lane 1) and of cells transfected with CcGnt1-FLAG (lanes 2 and 3) was loaded. In lane 3, protein extract of cells transfected with CcGnt1-FLAG was treated with PNGase F prior SDS-PAGE. Bands from protein marker are indicated on the left.Characterization of CcGnt1 (A–C) and its glycan product in vitro (D). A–C, in vitro reaction with variable conditions were performed and the qualitative glycan educt to product conversion was analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Glycans with the mass of 1377 Da (educt) and 1580 Da (product) are indicated schematically above the spectra. A, standard conditions with crude extract from cells transfected with vector control or with CcGnt1, respectively, were compared. B, influence of divalent cations on the enzyme activity. The reaction was performed with either Mn2+ (standard), Mg2+ or EDTA. C, to determine the transferase specificity, either UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GalNAc was used as sugar donor. D, product was analyzed in more detail. In vitro reaction product was digested with α-mannosidase, purified, and permethylated. MS/MS spectrum of the resulting glycans is shown with peaks corresponding to characteristic ions. These are labeled and illustrated in the Haworth representation above the spectrum. E, scheme summarizing the findings concerning the structure of the reaction product.GlcNAc2Man9 oligosaccharide was accepted as a substrate by the GlcNAc-transferase CcGnt1 (data not shown), supporting the view that the GlcNAc modification in Coprinopsis can occur, independent of Golgi α1–2 mannosidase trimming. This is different in mammalian cells where the α1–2 mannoses have to be removed by Golgi α1–2 mannosidases (29) before GnT I (30) and GnT III (31) can act to form hybrid- and complex-type glycans.To address the role of Gnt1 in fruiting body formation, RNA silencing of CcGnt1 was done to down-regulate the transcript levels of the locus. Fruiting body formation was not affected in two representative transformants, but we observed a strong reduction of GlcNAc modification in N-linked glycans due to the expression of RNAi (Fig. 6), while the overall relative amounts of Man5 and Man6 containing NLO, respectively, were not affected.Effect of CcGnt1 down-regulation on N-linked glycan. Fruiting bodies of wild type (wt) and of two independent RNAi transformants (T1, T2) were collected, and NLO of cell wall proteins were analyzed by MALDI-MS. Signal to noise (s/n) ratios of all NLO peaks within a spectrum were summed and divided by the s/n ratio of a glycan HexNAc2Hexn either with (dark gray bar) or without (light gray bar) additional GlcNAc.Our analysis of mature N-glycan from C. cinerea reflected the low diversity of NLO modification in fungal Golgi compartment. Mainly high mannose-type oligosaccharides were described so far in fungi, occasionally decorated with galactose, as it has been shown in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (4) and Aspergillus spp. (32). The addition of GlcNAc described in this study is the first Golgi modification reported for basidiomycetes. The position of the modification resembles a bisected-hybrid-type glycan as found in higher eukaryotes. There, the same position of the β-mannose is substituted with GlcNAc, however in a β conformation. GnT III, the transferase responsible for this modification is proposed to be a regulator of cell adhesion. Bisected glycans promote E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and prevent in a feedback loop integrin-mediated cell migration (33). In the context of fungal cell wall, hyphal adhesion and fruiting body formation can be seen as analogous to cell adhesion in animals. It is also in that developmental process where CcGnt1 was up-regulated and the modified N-glycan were found on cell wall proteins. However, we did not observe a defect in fruiting body development. This result can be interpreted in that this N-glycan modification was not essential for fruiting body formation. Alternatively, the residual enzyme activity after RNAi treatment or the redundant activity of CcGnt2 may be sufficient to mask a possible defect. Complete knock-out, overexpression of CcGnt1 and enzymatic characterization of the homolog CcGnt2 need to be performed to elucidate the function of the fungal bisecting GlcNAc.It is interesting to note that animals, plant and fungi can substitute the β-mannose of the core N-glycan in the Golgi compartment. However, this modification seems to be specific for the different kingdoms (β-GlcNAc in animals, β-xylose in plants, and α-GlcNAc in fungi).The transferase responsible for the novel α1–4-GlcNAc modification belongs to the retaining glycosyltransferases from the family 8, as classified by B. Henrissat and co-workers in the CaZY data base. Phylogenetic analysis of human and fungal members of that family allowed a further division into at least five subfamilies, where one clade includes relatives of these fungal GlcNAc-transferases, a second and third the homologues of galactinol synthases and glycogenin, respectively. The fourth subgroup contains mainly human members, Large being among them (34). Little is known about general function and characteristics of Large, but loss of function leads to muscle dystrophy caused by aberrant glycosylation of a single protein, α-Dystroglycan, which impairs binding to its ligand laminin (35). The ortholog Large2 has a distinct expression pattern but functional redundancy could be shown in cell culture experiments (36).The fifth clade unites fungal glycosyltransferases with unknown function. One of them, Mug136 (meiosis up-regulated gene; SPBC4C3.08) from S. pombe, was found to be differentially regulated but its role in meiosis is not yet clear (23). Other members of that subfamily are found in the basidiomycetous yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, where an additional pentose could be identified on N-glycan of cell wall protein.4The fact that only a few fungal Golgi modifications on N-glycan are described does not necessarily mean that they do not exist. Amounts might be below the detection limit of our analytical methods, and these processes might be spatially or temporally regulated, so that these minor modifications escape our attention. Nevertheless, the complexity of N-glycan processing in the Golgi compartment seems to be low.We thank Ben Schulz for inspiring discussions.

PMC2860967,Enzymatic deconstruction of xylan for biofuel production,False,"The combustion of fossil-derived fuels has a significant impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and correspondingly is an important contributor to anthropogenic global climate change. Plants have evolved photosynthetic mechanisms in which solar energy is used to fix CO2 into carbohydrates. Thus, combustion of biofuels, derived from plant biomass, can be considered a potentially carbon neutral process. One of the major limitations for efficient conversion of plant biomass to biofuels is the recalcitrant nature of the plant cell wall, which is composed mostly of lignocellulosic materials (lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose). The heteropolymer xylan represents the most abundant hemicellulosic polysaccharide and is composed primarily of xylose, arabinose, and glucuronic acid. Microbes have evolved a plethora of enzymatic strategies for hydrolyzing xylan into its constituent sugars for subsequent fermentation to biofuels. Therefore, microorganisms are considered an important source of biocatalysts in the emerging biofuel industry. To produce an optimized enzymatic cocktail for xylan deconstruction, it will be valuable to gain insight at the molecular level of the chemical linkages and the mechanisms by which these enzymes recognize their substrates and catalyze their reactions. Recent advances in genomics, proteomics, and structural biology have revolutionized our understanding of the microbial xylanolytic enzymes. This review focuses on current understanding of the molecular basis for substrate specificity and catalysis by enzymes involved in xylan deconstruction.Recent concerns in regards to global climate change have led to an emphasis on decreasing fossil fuel as liquid fuel for transportation and a shift to renewable liquid fuels, such as cellulosic ethanol. While the term ‘cellulosic ethanol’ creates the impression that such biofuels will be derived from cellulose, it is important to note that the term indeed alludes to ethanol originating from both cellulose and hemicellulose as substrates. Thus, it is perhaps more informative to use the expression biomass derived fuels or, in short, the very appropriate term ‘biofuels’. Corn residues and sugarcane bagasse are the current foci as potential sources of cellulosic biofuels, but future sources are likely to include the perennial grasses, Switchgrass (McLaughlin & Kszos, 2005; Parrish & Fike, 2005), and Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) due to their high yield, minimal requirement for nutrient and water input, and the fact that they can be grown in locations which would not compete with current food crops (Heaton et al., 2008a, b). The degradable components, mostly cellulose and hemicellulose, derived from these perennial grasses are anticipated to become significant substrates in the future for bioconversion to ethanol or other higher molecular weight alcohols and hydrocarbons (Somerville, 2007). The composition of dry plant biomass harvested from these perennial grasses consists primarily of the plant cell wall polymers, cellulose (31%), xylan (20%), and lignin (18%) (Fig. 1). Cellulose is a highly homogeneous polymer that consists of β-1,4-linked glucose units, which make interstrand hydrogen bonds to form a highly stable crystalline lattice (Laureano-Perez et al., 2005). Xylan, on the other hand, is a heteropolymeric hemicellulosic polymer that consists predominantly of the pentose sugars arabinose and xylose, although it may also contain glucuronyl, feruloyl, and acetyl groups (Ebringerova & Heinze, 2000). Complete hydrolysis of the two major components, cellulose and xylan, of perennial grasses, therefore, releases glucose, xylose, and arabinose, which can then be fermented or bioconverted to biofuels. The third major component, lignin, is a phenolic polymer that associates with plant cell wall polysaccharides, mainly through hydroxycinnamic acids, such as p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid in grasses and other graminaceous plants (Sun et al., 2001). The two hydroxycinnamic acids are mostly found as engaged in ester linkages to arabinose units in xylan and ether linkages to hydroxyl groups in lignin (Jeffries, 1990). The cross linking of plant cell wall polysaccharides and lignin through ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid is known to negatively impact hydrolysis to monomeric sugars and ultimately biodegradation. Delignification of biomass is, therefore, a critical step in bioconversion of biomass to biofuels.Compositional analysis of the Alamo cultivar of Switch-grass. As indicated, glucans are predominantly composed of cellulose. Hemicellulosic components include galactan, mannan, xylan, arabinan, and uronic acids, although xylan represents the most abundant hemicellulosic polymer (Vogel, 2008). These data were obtained from the US DOE Biomass Feedstock Composition and Property Database (http://www.afdc.energy.gov/biomass/progs/search1.cgi).Current strategies to delignify feedstock materials, including mild acid treatment, often lead to the production of a number of inhibitors of fermentation by ethanologenic yeast. These inhibitors include furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, which are produced by the dehydration of pentose and hexose sugars, respectively (Dunlop, 1948; Antal et al., 1990; Larsson et al., 1999). Significant improvements in plant cell wall hydrolysis and fermentation can be achieved if treatment methods that reduce toxic compounds and increase conversion of plant cell wall polysaccharides to monosaccharides are developed. Having evolved over millions of years for the purpose of extracting nutrients from plant cell walls, microbial enzymes represent an important alternative to the current treatment methods. More importantly, their products of hydrolysis are unlikely to exhibit the reported inhibitory effects.The emphasis accorded to deconstruction of cellulose is due to the use of its component sugar, glucose, as the primary substrate for microorganisms, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis, in the industrial production of ethanol. However, both microorganisms are incapable of fermenting the pentose sugars xylose and arabinose, commonly found in hemicellulose. There is, therefore, great interest in naturally-occurring or engineered organisms that can ferment the monosaccharide components of hemicellulose the second most abundant polysaccharide, to biofuels (Jeffries & Jin, 2000; Agbogbo & Coward-Kelly, 2008).Xylan represents the most abundant hemicellulose (Saha, 2003). Therefore, its deconstruction to the constituent sugars, mainly xylose and arabinose, (Fig. 2) for subsequent fermentation by ethanol producing microbes is critical to the efficient use of plant biomass for biofuel production. About two decades ago, Wong et al. (1988) published a review that remains a classic introduction to the biochemistry of xylan deconstruction. Since then, there have been other reviews mainly focused on plant cell wall degradation (Shallom & Shoham, 2003; Cann et al., 2007; Gilbert et al., 2008), including an article that addresses the structure of plant cell wall and its deconstruction through both chemical and enzymatic treatments (Saha, 2003). Unlike cellulose depolymerization, the optimization of which has received much recent attention (Percival Zhang et al., 2006; Bayer et al., 2007; Himmel et al., 2007), increased interest in the use of xylan as feedstock in industrial processes has not occurred with a commensurate increase in review articles addressing, in detail, xylan deconstruction by microbial enzymes. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the current effort in the emerging biofuel industry will emphasize a better understanding of xylan deconstruction, in order to increase the overall efficiency of biomass conversion to biofuels. Thus, in this review, we will concentrate our efforts on the enzymatic depolymerization of xylan to its component monosaccharides.General structure showing the various linkages found in a variety of xylans isolated from plant cell walls. As described in the text, xylans isolated from different sources may not possess all of the linkages shown. Ferulic acid may form a di-ferulic acid bridge with ferulic acid residues attached to other arabinoxylan chains. Xylose residues may be di-substituted or mono-substituted with arabinose at the O-2 and O-3 positions.Xylan is a heteropolymeric substrate consisting of a repeating β-1,4-linked xylose backbone decorated with acetyl, arabinofuranosyl, and 4-O-methyl glucuronyl groups and as stated above, xylan may be cross linked to lignin by aromatic esters. In order to efficiently depolymerize xylan to the component monosaccharides, a mixture of different enzymatic functionalities are required, including endo-1,4-β-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8), β-D-xylosidases (EC 3.2.1.37), α-L-arabinofuranosidases (AFs) (EC 3.2.1.55), α-glucuronidases (EC 3.2.1.139), acetyl xylan esterases (EC 3.1.1.72), and ferulic/coumaric acid esterases (EC 3.1.1.73).Much is known about the individual enzymatic functionalities required to depolymerize xylan and hundreds, perhaps thousands, of xylanolytic enzymes from a variety of microbial sources have been identified (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/). A significant limitation to optimizing xylan depolymerization is the lack of detailed knowledge of both the structural diversity in xylan and the corresponding enzymatic strategies employed by microbes to hydrolyze the linkages within this complex heteropolymer. However, current efforts in microbial and structural genomics are gradually leading to a better understanding of the structural basis for substrate specificity of a number of xylanolytic enzymes belonging to different glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. The subject of the current review is to summarize these recent insights and to discuss their potential application in improving biocatalytic saccharification of xylan for biofuel production.Xylans are polysaccharides consisting of a backbone of β-1,4-linked xylopyranosyl groups that are further decorated with different side chain residues; the proportions of which vary based on the source of the plant tissue. Xylans can be broadly classified as homoxylans, arabinoxylans, glucuronoxylans, and arabinoglucuronoxylans. Homoxylans, which consist of a chain of β-1,4- and β-1,3-linked xylose units are relatively rare in higher plants, but represent a significant structural component of cell walls in red seaweeds (Painter, 1983). All of the xylans of higher plants are based on a backbone of β-1,4-linked xylopyranose sugars and are typically substituted with acetyl groups and other sugar residues (Fig. 2). Arabinoxylans are principal components of the plant cell walls, especially in cereal grains including wheat, and consist of a xylose backbone with arabinose residues linked to the O-2 or O-3 of xylose. Xylose residues may be singly or doubly substituted with arabinose, and the arabinose residues may have additional linkages to the phenolic compound ferulic acid which may form covalent crosslinks to lignin or ferulic acid groups in other arabinoxylan chains. Glucuronoxylans are mainly found in hardwoods, herbs, and woody plants (Timell, 1964; Ebringerova & Heinze, 2000) and typically consist of a xylose backbone with 4-O-methyl-α-D-glucuronic acid (MeGA) residues linked off of the O-2 of xylose. Arabinoglucuronoxylans are typically found in the lignocellulose isolated from grasses and have arabinofuranosyl, MeGA, and acetyl side chains linked to the xylose backbone and reflect the composition of biomass currently targeted for biofuel production. While the relative proportions of plant cell wall polysaccharides within biofuel feedstocks are generally known, the dearth of knowledge on how individual sugar components are chemically linked within the cell wall represents an important limitation to designing enzyme cocktails for efficient hydrolysis of these polysaccharides.The structural diversity of plant cell wall xylans necessitates an equal diversity in the repertoire of enzymes for deconstruction of these polysaccharides. Thus, xylan-degrading bacteria and fungi have evolved diverse enzymatic machineries for the hydrolysis of xylan, and evidence is readily gleaned from the genome sequences of such organisms (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi). Detailed structural and biochemical studies of the substrate specificities for these enzymes are beginning to provide important insights into the function and evolution of these proteins.Plant cell wall polysaccharides are highly stable polymers composed of repeating sugar units whose glycosidic linkages exhibit half lives at room temperature on the order of 20 million years (Wolfenden et al., 1998). Organisms across the three domains of life (eukaryotes, archaea, and bacteria) have evolved GHs, which are extraordinarily efficient catalysts that enhance the rate of hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages over the noncatalyzed reaction by up to 17 orders of magnitude (Wolfenden et al., 1998). Xylan degrading GHs hydrolyze glycosidic linkages by inversion or retention of stereo-chemical configuration at the anomeric carbon. These two different mechanisms both employ a pair of carboxylic acid residues in the active site. Retaining glycosidases employ a double displacement mechanism involving two consecutive bimolecular substitution (SN2) reactions. The first substitution is carried out by a catalytic carboxylic acid nucleophile which results in the formation of a covalent enzyme–substrate intermediate (Vocadlo et al., 2001), and the second is performed by an activated water molecule (Fig. 3a). Inverting glycosidases, on the other hand, employ a single displacement reaction wherein a carboxylic acid group acts as a base to activate a water molecule for attack at the anomeric carbon (Fig. 3b). Henceforth, we describe the enzymes required for xylan hydrolysis into its component sugars for subsequent fermentation to biofuels.General glycosidase mechanisms for (a) retaining glycosidases and (b) inverting glycosidases. In (a), a deprotonated carboxylic acid nucleophile attacks the anomeric carbon, displacing the attached sugar residue (indicated as R) and forming a covalent enzyme–sugar adduct. Subsequently an activated water molecule displaces the enzymic carboxylic acid resulting in net retention of stereochemical configuration at the anomeric carbon. In (b), an activated water molecule displaces the attached sugar residue resulting in net inversion of stereochemical configuration. In both of these mechanisms, the glycoside leaving group is assisted through protonation by a catalytic acid residue.One of the critically important enzymatic activities required for the depolymerization of xylans is endo-1,4-β-xylanase (xylanase) activity. These enzymes cleave the β-1,4 glycosidic linkage between xylose residues in the backbone of xylans. Xylanases have been classified into GH families 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 43 on the basis of their amino acid sequences, structural folds, and mechanisms for catalysis (Cantarel et al., 2009). Previous reviews have discussed the biochemical and mechanistic properties of these enzymes in great detail (Wong et al., 1988; Collins et al., 2005; Berrin & Juge, 2008). The binding sites for xylose residues in xylanases are termed subsites with bond cleavage occurring between sugar residues at the −1 subsite (nonreducing end) and the +1 subsite (reducing end) of the polysaccharide substrate (Fig. 4) (Davies et al., 1997). GH 10 and 11 xylanases represent the best studied xylanase families and they differ in the number of subsites they possess, with GH 10 having four or five subsites (Biely et al., 1981, 1997b; Derewenda et al., 1994) and GH 11 having at least seven subsites (Vrsanska et al., 1982; Bray & Clarke, 1992). While commercially available nondecorated xylo-oligosaccharide substrates are convenient for assessing xylanase activity, limited information can be drawn from studies with these substrates since they do not represent the natural xylan substrates that these enzymes would encounter when deconstructing plant cell walls. A recent study assessed the activity of several GH 10 and 11 proteins with purified xylo-oligosaccharides substituted with MeGA and revealed that GH 10 enzymes cleave xylan chains when MeGA is linked to xylose at the +1 subsite, whereas GH 11 enzymes cleave xylan when MeGA is appended at the +2 subsite (Fig. 5) (Kolenova et al., 2006). Direct support for these results was reported in a recent study on the mass spectra of the products of hydrolysis for GH 10 and 11 with arabinoxylan substrates. The results indicated that GH 10 products have arabinose residues substituted on xylose at the +1 subsite, whereas GH 11 products have arabinose residues substituted at the +2 subsite (Maslen et al., 2007). These results suggest that GH 10 enzymes are able to hydrolyze xylose linkages closer to side chain residues and thus help to explain why GH 10 enzymes release shorter products than GH 11 enzymes when incubated with arabinoglucuronoxylan substrates (Biely et al., 1997b).Diagrammatic representation of the sugar binding sites in glycosidases based on the scheme proposed by Davies et al. (1997).Differences in the products of hydrolysis between GH 10 and 11 endo-xylanases when incubated with substituted xylans (Biely et al., 1997b; Maslen et al., 2007). (a) For GH family 10 enzymes, substitutions on the xylan chain are accommodated at the +1 site, thus these enzymes can release xylo-oligosaccharides in which the terminal nonreducing xylose residue is substituted. (b) For GH family 11 enzymes, substitutions on the xylan chain are not accommodated at the +1 site, thus these enzymes produce xylo-oligosaccharides with substitutions at the penultimate xylose residue. GH, glycoside hydrolase.Recent structural and other biochemical studies support the data above and indicate that while GH 10 and 11 enzymes are both able to bind decorated xylo-oligosaccharides (Fujimoto et al., 2004; Pell et al., 2004b; Vardakou et al., 2005, 2008), GH 10 enzymes can accommodate linkages on xylose at the +1 subsite (Fig. 6a) (Kaneko et al., 2004; Pell et al., 2004a), whereas GH 11 enzymes can accommodate linkages on xylose at the +2 subsite (Fig. 6b) (Vardakou et al., 2008). Furthermore, the structure for a GH 10 enzyme complexed with feruloyl arabinoxylodisaccharide (FAX2) revealed that the arabinose substituent appended at the +1 subsite was a significant determinant of substrate specificity for a GH 10 xylanase from the thermophilic fungus, Thermoascus aurantiacus (Vardakou et al., 2005). Taken together these results support the idea that xylan side chain decorations are recognized by xylanases, and the degree of substitution in xylan will influence the products of hydrolysis for xylanases. This difference in substrate specificity for xylanases has important implications in the deconstruction of xylan. For example, α-glucuronidases can only release MeGA from a terminal nonreducing end xylose unit, thus the products of a GH 10 enzyme acting on glucuronoxylan will be a direct substrate for α-glucuronidase (Fig. 5a), whereas α-glucuronidases will be unable to hydrolyze GH 11 products since the MeGA will be substituted off of the penultimate xylose residue (Fig. 5b).Structural surface representation of the (a) Neocallimastix patriciarum GH family 11 xylanase in complex with ferulic acid arabinoxylotrisaccharide (PDB accession no. 2VGD) (Vardakou et al., 2008) and the (b) Cellvibrio mixtus GH family 10 xylanase in complex with aldotetraouronic acid (PDB accession no. 1UQZ) (Pell et al., 2004b). For (a), the active site cleft of the GH 11 enzyme excludes the possibility of a substitution at the +1 subsite of the xylose chain, whereas substitutions may be accommodated at the +2 subsite. For (b), the open topology of the active site of the GH 10 enzyme permits the accommodation of a substitution at the +1 subsite. All structural representations in this and subsequent figures were generated with the UCSF Chimera software package (Pettersen et al., 2004). GH, glycoside hydrolase.The foregoing discussions, therefore, underscore the importance of understanding the natural substrate specificities for xylanolytic enzymes and indicate that comprehensive knowledge of the structure of the xylan substrate will be indispensable for designing optimized enzyme cocktails.The function of AF in xylan deconstruction is to remove arabinose side chains from the xylose backbone of arabinoglucuronoxylan. These enzymes are grouped into four different families of (GH 43, 51, 54, and 62), and can hydrolyze glycosidic linkages with net inversion (GH 43) or retention (GH 51, 54) of stereochemical configuration at the anomeric carbon. In the context of arabinoglucuronoxylans, there is diversity in the types of linkages for arabinosyl units, and this has significant consequences in terms of the type of enzyme that removes arabinose side chains. Specifically, arabinose may be linked to the O-2 or O-3 of xylose in the xylan backbone, and these xylose sugars may be either singly or doubly substituted with arabinose. Furthermore, some arabinose molecules may have ferulic acid molecules esterified to the 5′-OH which may subsequently be covalently tethered to ferulic acid residues attached to other arabinoxylan chains (Fig. 2).Members of the GH family 43 AF’s display a variety of different substrate specificities that is beginning to be understood in greater molecular detail as more three dimensional (3D) structures are solved for these enzymes. Enzymes with AF activity may be grouped into three major classes: (a) AF type A enzymes that are only active on short arabino-oligosaccharides and pNP-α-L-arabinofuranoside (Pitson et al., 1996), (b) AF type B enzymes that are active on a wider variety of substrates including short oligosaccharides and longer polysaccharides such as arabinoxylan and arabinan (Pitson et al., 1996), and (c) arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolases (AXHs) which are mainly active on arabinoxylan (Kormelink et al., 1991a, b, Bourgois et al., 2007). The AXHs can further be classified based on whether they release α-L-arabinose from only mono-substituted xylose residues (AXH-m) (Kellett et al., 1990; Kormelink et al., 1991b, Bourgois et al., 2007) or only disubstituted xylose residues (AXH-d) (Van Laere et al., 1997, 1999; van den Broek et al., 2005; Sorensen et al., 2006).Recently, crystal structures have been reported for a GH 43 AF type A β-xylosidase/α-L-arabinofuranosidase from the rumen bacterium, Selenomonas ruminantium (Brunzelle et al., 2008) and a GH 43 AXH-m from the soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis (Vandermarliere et al., 2009). These enzymes have distinct substrate preferences with the S. ruminantium enzyme (SXA) having high activity on pNP-β-D-xylopyranoside, pNP-α-L-arabinofuranoside (Whitehead & Cotta, 2001) and xylo-oligosaccharides (Jordan et al., 2007), whereas the B. subtilis enzyme (BsAXH-m2,3) exhibited highest activity on pNP-α-L-arabinofuranoside and water extractable arabinoxylans (Bourgois et al., 2007). The domain architectures for these two enzymes, revealed by the 3D structures, provide significant insight into the differences in the substrate specificities for these two enzymes. Although they both possess an N-terminal five-bladed β-propeller fold common to GH 43 enzymes, BsAXH-m 2,3 has a C-terminal CBM family 6 (CBM6)-like domain that is clear of the active site region (Fig. 7a), whereas SXA has a large C-terminal β-sandwich domain which projects a loop that closes off the active site pocket for the enzyme (Fig. 7b). For BsAXH-m2,3, a groove in the protein is located just above the active site that binds to xylo-oligosaccharides and allows for arabinose side chains substituted from either the O-2 or O-3 of xylose to enter the active site for hydrolysis. The SXA on the other hand does not possess this groove, and the β-sandwich loop restricts the size of the active site such that only one to two residues may enter the active site, resulting in an exo-type enzyme activity.Structural representations of the (a) Bacillus subtilis GH family 43 arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase (AXH-m2,3) in complex with xylotetraose (PDB accession no. 3C7G) (Vandermarliere et al., 2009) and the (b) Selenomonas ruminantium GH family 43 β-xylosidase (SXA) in complex with 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane (PDB accession no. 3C2U) (Brunzelle et al., 2008). Both enzymes possess two domains, an N-terminal β-propeller domain and a C-terminal mainly β-sheet domain, although the C-terminal domain for SXA is much larger and projects a loop that contacts the active site for the enzyme. GH, glycoside hydrolase.Xylan-1,4-β-xylosidase (β-xylosidase) enzymes release xylose monomers from the nonreducing end of xylo-oligosaccharides. As described earlier, xylanases break down xylan polymers into shorter fragments, thereby increasing the total number of nonreducing ends available for hydrolysis by β-xylosidases. β-xylosidases are grouped into five different families (GH 3, 39, 43, 52, and 54) (Henrissat, 1991) and their reaction mechanisms result either in inversion (GH 43) or retention (GH 3, 39, 52, and 54) of stereochemical configuration at the anomeric carbon. The most abundant and best characterized β-xylosidases are from GH 3 and 43 (Sunna & Antranikian, 1997).The crystal structures for two biochemically characterized GH 43 β-xylosidase enzymes have revealed the presence of two domains, an N-terminal five-bladed β-propeller domain, and a C-terminal α/β sandwich domain (Brux et al., 2006; Brunzelle et al., 2008). The catalytic residues are located in a shallow active site cleft in the center of the β-propeller domain which is closed off by a phenylalanine residue contributed from the C-terminal α/β sandwich domain. These enzymes possess two subsites for sugar binding and it is anticipated that when hydrolyzing oligo-saccharides longer than two sugar residues, the remaining residues will extend out into solution (Fig. 8). This prediction is supported by biochemical analyses of GH 43 β-xylosidases that reveal a decrease in the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) when active on xylo-oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization greater than two (Van Doorslaer et al., 1985; Jordan et al., 2007; Wagschal et al., 2009), suggesting that these enzymes possess just two xylose binding sites.Schematic representation of the GH family 43 β-xylosidase (SXA) from Selenomonas ruminantium indicating the two xylose binding sites in the active site and the projection of extended xylose chains out into solution. GH, glycoside hydrolase.The GH 3 represents a large group of glycosidic enzymes and includes members that possess several distinct enzymatic activities including β-D-glucosidase, β-D-xylosidase, AF and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NagZ) activities (Harvey et al., 2000; Faure, 2002). Despite the large number of β-xylosidase enzymes that have been characterized from this gene family, there are currently no crystal structures available for enzymes with β-xylosidase activity from this family. There are two crystal structures for GH 3 enzymes, one for a putative NagZ from the bacterium Vibrio cholera (unpublished, protein databank accession no. 1y65), and a variety of structures with different substrate analogs and inhibitors for a β-D-glucosidase from Hordeum vulgare (Barley) (Varghese et al., 1999; Hrmova et al., 2001, 2002, 2005). In the case of the NagZ structure from V. cholera, a single N-terminal (α/β)8 triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel domain exists (Fig. 9a), whereas analysis of the crystal structure for the H. vulgare β-D-glucosidase revealed the presence of an N-terminal (α/β)8 TIM barrel and an additional C-terminal (α/β)6 sandwich domain (Fig. 9b). Most of the catalytic residues for these enzymes map to the N-terminal (α/β)8 TIM barrel domain, however, for the Barley enzyme, a putative catalytic acid/base residue was located in the C-terminal domain (Varghese et al., 1999).Structural representations of the (a) Vibrio cholerae putative GH family 3 N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase in complex with N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (PDB accession no. 1Y65) and the (b) Hordeum vulgare GH family 3 β-xylosidase in complex with glucose (PDB accession no. 1EX1) (Varghese et al., 1999). As described in the text, acquisition of the second (α/β)6 sandwich domain may have led to the evolution of β-glucosidase activity within this family of proteins. GH, glycoside hydrolase.The β-hexosaminidases from GH family 20 employ substrate-assisted catalysis whereby the N-acetamido group on the C2 of the N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl substrate acts as the catalytic nucleophile (Tews et al., 1996; Drouillard et al., 1997). If this were the case for the GH 3 NagZ, then these enzymes might not require the additional acidic residue provided by the C-terminal (α/β)6 sandwich domain (Harvey et al., 2000). These observations support the possibility that the N-terminal (α/β)8 TIM barrel domain (Fig. 9a) evolved initially to encode NagZ activity, a function that is important for cell wall recycling in bacteria (Cheng et al., 2000). Gene duplication and the acquisition of an additional (α/β)6 sandwich domain may then have led to the evolution of β-glucosidase and β-xylosidase activities on this protein scaffold (Table 1). Further support for this idea comes from the fact that a number of GH 3 genes have been identified that have both the (α/β)6 and (α/β)8 TIM barrel domains, however the regions of these domains in the polypeptide sequence are switched, yet these proteins retain their enzymatic activities (Honda et al., 1988; Ohmiya et al., 1990). An additional protective antigen 14 kDa (PA14)-like domain has been identified for GH 3 proteins, which forms an insertion within the N-terminal (α/β)6 sandwich domain (Table 1). The functional significance of the PA14-like domain insertion in GH 3 enzymes is currently unknown, however several lines of evidence support the possibility that the PA14 domain represents a novel CBM (Rigden et al., 2004; Zupancic et al., 2008).Domain architecture for GH family 3 genes.The active site for the Barley GH 3 β-glucosidase is a small, coin-shaped cavity that, similar to GH 43 β-xylosidases, possesses only two substrate binding sites. Subsite mapping studies for this enzyme using gluco-oligosaccharides of varying lengths confirmed the presence of just two glucoside binding sites in the enzyme (Hrmova et al., 2002). The structure of the Barley β-glucosidase is useful for making generalizations on the structure–activity relationships for GH 3 β-xylosidases. However, the amino acid residues that confer substrate specificity (β-glucosidase vs. β-xylosidase) for this family of enzymes remain to be elucidated. Thus, determination of the 3D structure for β-xylosidases in this family will yield insight into the molecular determinants of substrate specificity which will prove invaluable for characterizing the function and substrate specificity for members of this large family of enzymes.Xylose residues within arabinoglucuronoxylan may be substituted at O-2 with MeGA (Fig. 2). The α-glucuronidases cleave MeGA from xylose residues when the MeGA is attached to the terminal, nonreducing end of xylo-oligosaccharides (Puls et al., 1987; Siikaaho et al., 1994). An additional limitation to the release of MeGA by α-glucuronidases is the extent of acetylation of the xylose chain in proximity to the MeGA substituent (Puls & Schuseil, 1993). The crystal structures for two bacterial α-glucuronidases (Geobacillus stearothermophilus AguA and Cellvibrio japonicus GlcA67A) provided insight into the specific requirements of α-glucuronidases (Nurizzo et al., 2002; Golan et al., 2004). These structures revealed a (β/α)8 barrel enzyme possessing a deep active site pocket which explains the requirement for terminally appended MeGA sidechains on the xylan backbone. The biological significance of this deep active site pocket and absolute requirement for MeGA linked to the O-2 of xylose residues at the nonreducing end is that α-glucuronidases require xylanase activity to generate their cognate substrates. This suggests that α-glucuronidases function downstream of xylanases to deconstruct plant cell wall polysaccharides (Nurizzo et al., 2002).Arabinoglucuronoxylans are typically acetylated at O-2 and O-3 positions of the xylose chain and frequently have ferulic acid or coumaric acid groups esterified to the 5′-OH of arabinofuranosyl groups. The acetyl groups affect the capacity of other xylanolytic enzymes such as xylanases (Biely et al., 1986; Grohmann et al., 1989) and α-glucuronidases (Puls & Schuseil, 1993) to bind and hydrolyze backbone or side chain linkages. Ferulic and coumaric acid groups may be covalently linked either to lignin or to other ferulic or coumaric acid groups in xylans, thus these chemical linkages impart significant limitations to deconstructing xylan substrates. Correspondingly, many xylanolytic microbes harbor genes encoding ferulic/coumaric acid esterases and acetyl xylan esterases. Ferulic/coumaric acid esterases belong to the carbohydrate esterase (CE) family 1, whereas acetyl xylan esterase activity has been described for members of CE 1–7, 12 and the recently discovered family 16 (Li et al., 2008). With the exception of acetyl xylan esterases in CE 4, all of the ferulic/coumaric acid esterases and acetyl xylan esterases employ a Ser–His–Asp(Glu) catalytic triad analogous to the mechanism utilized by serine proteases (Kraut, 1977). This mechanism involves two phases, the initial acylation of the nucleophilic serine residue followed by deacylation with water acting as a nucleophile (Fig. 10). The alternative mechanism identified for members of CE 4 involves divalent cations coordinated by histidine residues and a nucleophilic aspartic acid residue (Taylor et al., 2006).General mechanism for esterases employing the Ser–His–Asp(Glu) catalytic triad. Analogous to serine proteases, the first set of reactions leads to acylation of the enzyme followed by de-acylation of the enzyme involving attack of the ester linkage by an activated water molecule.GHs are modular in general, and likewise many xylanolytic enzymes exhibit a modular domain organization and link various catalytic domains or carbohydrate binding domains within the same polypeptide.CBMs increase the effective concentration of catalytic modules on the surface of insoluble substrates and may change the structure of the sugar by disrupting hydrogen bonding interactions (Shoseyov et al., 2006). While the structure of cellulose is quite homogeneous, as mentioned above, the structure of xylan can vary greatly with different residues substituted off of the xylose backbone. This difference in structure imparts significant limitations to CBMs targeted towards xylan relative to the CBMs that bind cellulose, which is a homogenous substrate. Similar to the binding of decorated xylo-oligosaccharides by xylanases, the decorations on xylan will likely influence the way that CBMs bind to xylan. Indeed, the crystal structure for the family 15 CBM from the saprophytic soil bacterium, C. japonicus revealed that when bound to xylopentaose, the oligosaccharide adopts a helical conformation such that the O-2 and O-3 for all but one of the xylose residues face outward into solution (Fig. 11) (Szabo et al., 2001). It is anticipated that this conformation will allow the CBM to accommodate decorations on the xylan chain, thus permitting the C. japonicus CBM to bind substituted arabinoglucuronoxylans (Szabo et al., 2001).Structural surface rendering of the Cellvibrio japonicus family 15 carbohydrate binding module (CBM) in complex with xylopentaose (PDB accession no. 1GNY) (Szabo et al., 2001). The xylopentaose sugar adopts a helical conformation wherein most of the O-2 and O-3 hydroxyl groups point out into solution suggesting that this CBM could accommodate a highly decorated xylan chain. The only exception is the fourth xylose residue which makes hydrogen bond contacts from both the O-2 and O-3 hydroxyl groups to the protein.The biocatalytic conversion of xylan to the constituent monosaccharides, xylose, arabinose, and glucuronic acid will require the coordinated function of these xylanolytic enzymes. In our model presented in Fig. 12, we can envision xylanases, acetyl xylan esterases, and ferulic acid esterases functioning together to produce short, substituted xylo-oligosaccharides with the concomitant release of ferulic and acetic acid byproducts (Fig. 12a). The substituted xylo-oligosaccharides then become the substrates for arabinofuranosidases and glucuronidases that liberate arabinose and glucuronic acid, leaving linear, nonbranched xylo-oligosaccharides (Fig. 12b). Xylosidases then convert the xylo-oligosaccharides into their constituent xylose sugars (Fig. 12c). Finally, fermenting microorganisms, naturally capable or engineered to ferment pentose sugars, will take up the xylose and arabinose and shuttle them into the pentose phosphate pathway for subsequent fermentation to biofuels (Fig. 12d). Indeed, a strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli has been genetically modified to produce ethanol from mixed sugars (glucose, xylose, and arabinose) that represent the products of hydrolysis of cellulose and xylan (Nichols et al., 2001). In addition, naturally-occurring yeasts such as Pachysolen tannophilus, Pichia stipitis, and Candida shehate are capable of fermenting xylose to ethanol, and their commercial utilization may only require genetic manipulation to increase their ethanol tolerance and rates of growth (Wang et al., 1980; Schneider et al., 1981; Saha, 2003). Finally, through genetic engineering, the metabolic pathways that allow these microorganisms to produce ethanol from pentose sugars, especially xylose and arabinose, may be introduced into the yeast S. cerevisiae and the bacterium Z. mobilis to facilitate utilization of these substrates. Although not a simple feat, it is anticipated that these are accomplishments are likely to be reported in the near future due to the current efforts in biofuel research.Schematic outline depicting the functional coordination of xylanolytic enzymes in the deconstruction of xylan for biofuels production. (a) Xylanases, acetyl xylan esterases, and ferulic acid esterases function together to produce short, substituted xylo-oligosaccharides with the concomitant release of ferulic and acetic acid byproducts. (b) Arabinofuranosidases and glucuronidases then liberate arabinose and glucuronic acid from these substituted xylo-oligosaccharides. (c) Xylosidases convert the xylo-oligosaccharides into their constituent xylose sugars. (d) Fermenting microorganisms take up the xylose and arabinose and shuttle them into the pentose phosphate pathway for subsequent fermentation to biofuels.Plant cell walls are complex structures that have a variety of components including cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin (galacturonic acid polymers), and lignin. The relative proportions of these polymers vary among different species of plants, thus generalizations made based on the structure of cell wall polysaccharides studied from one species may not hold true when considering the cell wall structure of another species. Correspondingly, to generate optimized enzyme cocktails for biofuels production from lignocellulose, it will be essential to have a detailed knowledge of the relative compositions and fine structure of the plant cell wall components for the specific biomass feed-stocks being targeted, such as Miscanthus and Switch-grass.Artificial substrates, while useful as initial screens for enzymatic activity, may be misleading. For example, the two GH 43 enzymes discussed above that have significant activity with pNPA as a substrate target completely different chemical linkages with BsAXH-m2,3 releasing arabinofuranosyl units from xylan fragments and SXA hydrolyzing xylo-oligosaccharides to monomeric xylose units. These results illustrate the catalytic promiscuity exhibited by many GHs and underscore the limitations of using artificial substrates to assign function to unknown proteins. Testing for enzymatic activity of proteins with natural plant cell wall polysaccharides will be indispensable for evaluating the true molecular function of newly isolated proteins. Furthermore, a standardized set of chemically and structurally defined plant cell wall polysaccharide substrates isolated from biomass feedstocks would prove valuable. Such substrates will permit the reconstitution of customized enzyme cocktails and will provide a platform for comparing the efficiencies of enzymes isolated from various microbial sources. Standardizing substrates and methods has already proved to be useful for interlaboratory comparison of xylanase activity (Bailey et al., 1992). Establishment of materials and methods with substrates from biomass feedstocks will have additional benefits. Structural studies of xylanolytic enzymes have already proven valuable for identifying the substrate specificity of xylan degrading enzymes, and future studies in this important arena will likely aid us in identifying optimized enzyme cocktails for the deconstruction of hemi-cellulosic polysaccharides.We would like to thank the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI) for supporting our research on lignocellulose deconstruction.

PMC2866150,Consumption of Human Milk Oligosaccharides by Gut-related Microbes,False,"Human milk contains large amounts of complex oligosaccharides that putatively modulate the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants by acting as decoy binding sites for pathogens and as prebiotics for enrichment of beneficial bacteria. Several bifidobacterial species have been shown to grow well on human milk oligosaccharides. However, little data exists on other bacterial species. In this work we examined 16 bacterial strains belonging to 10 different genera for growth on human milk oligosaccharides. For this propose, we used a chemically-defined medium, ZMB1, which allows vigorous growth of a number gut–related microorganisms in a fashion similar to complex media. Interestingly, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides vulgatus strains were able to metabolize milk oligosaccharides with high efficiency, while Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Eubacterium, Clostridium, and Escherichia coli strains grew less well or not at all. Mass spectrometry-based glycoprofiling of the oligosaccharide consumption behavior revealed a specific preference for fucosylated oligosaccharides by Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis and Bacteroides vulgatus. This work expands the current knowledge of human milk oligosaccharides consumption by gut microbes, revealing bacteroides as avid consumer of this substrate. These results provide insight on how human milk oligosaccharides shape the infant intestinal microbiota.Human milk, the sole nourishment for breast-fed infants, is an interesting model of a food shaped by evolution to promote the healthy development of newborns. Of the various components in human milk, oligosaccharides constitute a significant fraction, being the third most abundant molecular species in terms of concentration after lactose and lipids (1). Up to 200 different structures have been defined for human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) (2). All HMO structures follow the same basic configuration: a lactose core at the reducing end, elongated by N-acetyl-lactosamine units with at least twelve different types of glycosidic bonds, wherein fucose and sialic acid residues are added to terminal positions (3). The linear and branched HMOs vary in size, from three to thirty-two sugars, being mostly fucosylated neutral oligosaccharides (2). Infants digest a minor portion of HMOs present in the breast milk, while a fraction passes undigested through the intestine (4). Different researchers have confirmed that HMOs are resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis from intestinal brush border membrane and pancreatic juices (5, 6). We hypothesize that, given the high concentration of oligosaccharides in human milk, these polymers must have an important role in the well-being of the baby, particularly when considering the evolutionary forces that have shaped the contents of human milk—to ensure the least energy burden on the mother and the greatest survival benefit for the infant (7). One of the functions attributed to HMOs is a role in the development of neonatal intestine. HMOs modulate intestinal cell proliferation and maturation in vitro, suggesting that mucosal barrier of the gut can be affected by these milk components (8). In addition, HMOs are considered a mechanism to protect the newborn against exogenous infections (3). Study of the response of epithelial cells to the presence of of 3’sialyllactose, an acidic HMO, has suggested that the expression of various glycosyltransferases is diminished. Thus, this particular HMO seems able to modify the glycan content of the epithelial cell surface and the receptor sites for some pathogens (9). Moreover, different in vitro studies have demonstrated that HMOs bind and block the infection of pathogenic bacteria to animal cells by acting as receptor analogs to the intestinal cell glycans (10–12). A recent study shows how HMOs can inhibit transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ lymphocytes (13).Another hypothesis regarding the bioactive function of HMOs is a role as “prebiotic” (14). Prebiotics are defined as those substances that allow specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microbiota, conferring benefits upon host health (15). Prebiotics stimulate the growth of the “beneficial” bacteria including bifidobacteria, genus generally predominant in the intestinal microbiota of the breast-bed infants (16). We recently demonstrated that Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697 (termed “Bifidobacterium infantis”) grows on HMOs as a sole sugar source while Lactobacillus gasseri, an adult gut isolate, does not (17). To examine this further, we developed a method for quantifying consumption of individual HMOs using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTICR MS) (2, 18). With this method, we can detect individual neutral oligosaccharides, which represent 90–95% of total HMOs (2). This approach allowed us the determination of the HMO consumption profile of different species belonging to bifidobacterial group (Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium adolescentis) (19, 20). Comparisons among the selected species and strains revealed significant differences in their consumption profiles. Some of the examined microorganisms show preferences for consuming specific non-fucosylated or non-sialylated oligosaccharide structures, while other strains reveal a broader glycoside consumption profile including fucosylated glycans. Subsequent genomic analysis of a “high consumer” of HMOs, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC15697, revealed the existence of a 43 kb gene cluster dedicated to HMOs import and processing (7).After birth, the infant gut undergoes a complex process of microbial colonization. Aerobic microbes initially colonize the intestine of the newborn however as oxygen is consumed, the microbiota switches to anaerobic species, composed mainly by bifidobacteria, and to a lesser extent, bacteroides and clostridia (21). Among the components of human milk, oligosaccharides are believed to directly influence the final microbial composition of the infant gut. As described, we have recently demonstrated that specific strains of bifidobacteria can grow vigorously on HMOs. However, the influence of these oligosaccharides on the growth of other bacterial genera present in the gut during the first months of life remained unexplored. In this work, we use a scalable method previously developed by our group (19), examining 16 strains of bacteria belonging to 10 different genera related to gut microbiota. We add the advantage of using a chemically defined media, termed ZMB1, initially designed for the growth of lactococci, enterococci and streptococci (22). We demonstrate that ZMB1, which does not contain any complex component, is a useful minimum medium for growth of a fairly wide array of intestinal microbes in order to test the specificity of HMOs in vitro. Growth curves and detailed glycoprofile analysis of HMOs consumption using MALDI-FTICR MS, evidence that bifidobacteria and bacteroides strains are able to metabolize this substrate, while other strains, such as clostridia, enterococci or Escherichia coli, were not. The results obtained in this work provide an insight in the selectivity of HMOs, showing for first time bacteroides as a species able to consume these sugars.The oligosaccharide purification was performed according to the method described by Ward et al. (17). Milk samples were provided by the Milk Bank of San Jose, California, and Austin, Texas.Bacteria listed in Table 1 were tested for growth in the presence of HMO. Based in the results obtained by Ward et al. (17), Lactobacillus gasseri UCD235 was included as a control for low growth in HMOs. Seed cultures of all bacteria were prepared as following. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Escherichia coli. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactococcus lactis strains were incubated overnight while two days of incubation were necessary for Clostriidum perfringens, C. difficile, Eubacterium rectale, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus and Veillonela parvula strains. All bacteria were grown in anaerobic conditions at 37°C, using an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, MI). Reinforced clostridium medium (RCM) was used for growing clostridia, Bacteroides and Eubacterium rectale, M17 supplemented with 2% Glucose for enterococci, streptococci and lactococci growth, MRS for Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium infantis strains, BHI for Veillonela, and LB for E. coli strains. All complex media was purchased from Becton Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Two µl of each resulting overnight culture were used to inoculate 200 µl of various media distributed in the wells of a microplate. Bacterial growths were tested in the complex media LB, MRS, M17 and RCM, as well as in the chemically-defined medium ZMB1, prepared according to the description of Zhang et al. (22). ZMB1 contains 2% glucose as a sole carbon source. After verifying that ZMB1 allowed growth of the various gut bacteria, each strain was grown overnight in the same medium. Two µl of the overnight cultures was added to 200 µl of modified ZMB1 in which the glucose was replaced with 2% HMO and a another 2 µl inoculated into ZMB1 without added sugar. In all the cases the cultures in the wells of the microtiter plates were covered with 40 µl of sterile mineral oil to avoid evaporation. Cell growth was monitored in real time by assessing optical density at 600 nm using a BioTek PowerWave 340 plate reader (BioTek, Winoosky, VT) every 30 min preceded by 15 seconds shaking at variable speed. Two biological replicates (three technical replicates each) were performed for every studied strain and medium. Maximum OD and growth rates were calculated and expressed as the mean of all replicates with the respective standard deviation. These calculations were done with the Bacterial Growth Kinetics Software (F. Breidt, pers. comm.). The maximum OD observed for each strain grown on HMOs, was compared with the maximum OD obtained in the absence of sugar source. This difference in OD (ΔOD) was used as a criterion to evaluate the strain’s ability for growing on milk oligosaccharides.Kinetic Analysis of Bacterial Growth. Optical Densities were measured at a Wavelength of 600 nm. Growth Rates (hr−1) were calculated using the Bacterial Growth Kinetic Software Package (F. Breidt, pers.comm). Values are reported as a mean (± sd). Bold numbers correspond to obtained values from high HMO consumers.Bacteria cultures in modified ZMB1 (2% HMO) were collected and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 30 minutes. Supernatants were boiled for 5 minutes and filtered using a MultiScreen 96-well filtration plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Remaining oligosaccharides recovered in the supernatants (25 µl), were reduced using 25 µl of 2.0 M sodium borohydride and incubated at 65 °C for 1h. For quantitative analysis deuterated HMOs (50 µl) were added as internal standard. The oligosaccharides were desalted and purified by solid phase extraction, following the method described by LoCascio et al (20).The mass spectra analyses were performed on a HiRes Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry instrument (MALDI-FTICR) with an external MADI source, a 355-nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser, a quadrupole ion guide, and a 7.0 Tesla superconducting magnet (IonSpec Corp. Irvine, CA). 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) was used as matrix and samples were prepared following the fast evaporation technique. 1 µl of analyte (glycans) was spotted onto a 100-well stainless steel sample plate (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) followed by the addition of 0.2 µl of 0.1 mM NaCl as a dopant and 1 µl of 0.4 M DHB. The spots were allowed to dry under a stream of air before analysis. Fifteen acquisitions were recorded for each replicate. MALDI-FTICR MS analysis was performed in the positive ion mode in the m/z scans range of 220–4500 with 1024K data points and 1 Mhz ADC rate acquired. The ratio of deuterated species to undeuterated species (D/H) and percent of consumption was calculated according to Ninonuevo et al. (20) for the 14 most abundant HMO signals present in the spectra. Standard deviations for the percent consumption values were calculated from the measured mass spectral intensities via error propagation. Student’s t tests (p=0.05) were performed to determine the significance of the difference in consumption values between strains.Our previous work to characterize HMO-consumption by bifidobacteria employed a rich medium, MRS (19, 20). However when tested, other lactic acid bacteria showed significant background growth in MRS medium lacking any added sugar, thus making testing for HMO growth problematic since it would be impossible to discern weak, or even moderate, growth on HMO from background growth (see Supplementary Figure 1). To circumvent this problem we employed the newly developed chemically-defined medium ZMB1 (22) which allowed robust growth of all the species examined here. Indeed, to our knowledge, no other chemically-defined medium has been described for use among this many genera. As seen Supplementary Figure 2, much less background growth of S. thermophilius is observed in ZMB1 lacking glucose in contrast to MRS lacking glucose (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, ZMB1 was ideal for the evaluation of HMO consumption by the range of genera tested herein. Using ZMB1, the maximum OD values obtained with glucose as a sugar source ranged from 0.815, in the case of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, to 1.5 for Enterococcus faecalis 117 (Table 1).The various strains were grown in modified ZMB1 with HMOs as sole sugar source. In addition, all the selected strains were grown in ZMB1 media without sugar. Maximum optical densities (ODs), ΔOD (Maximum OD in modified ZMB1 minus maximum OD in ZMB1 without sugar) and growth rates are shown in Table 1. Among all the tested microorganisms, Bacterioides fragilis ATCC25285 and Bacterioides vulgatus ATCC8482 reached the highest cell density on HMOs, with ΔOD > 0.6. We have previously demonstrated the B. infantis ATCC15967 is able to consume milk oligosaccharides (19, 20). Thus, this strain was used as a positive control for consumption. However, the maximum OD reached using modified ZMB1 with 2% HMO (0.698; Table 1) was lower than that observed previously in rich media (modified MRS with 1.6% HMO) (17). Interestingly, the species with higher OD (Bacterioides fragilis, Bacterioides vulgatus and Bifidobacterium infantis) also show the longest lag times among the strains tested (data not shown). Some strains show weak, but noticeable, growth on HMOs including Lb. acidophilus, C. perfringens, Escherichia coli OP50, Eubacterium rectale and S. thermophilus, with ΔODs between 0.1 and 0.29. C. difficile, Enterococcus faecalis, V. parvula and Escherichia coli EC100, did not grow at all in this substrate. It should be noted that all these species were capable of vigorous growth on ZMB1 media containing glucose (to ODs of 0.8–1.5).In order to determine the specific HMO structures consumed from the species that grew well on HMOs, supernatants from Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus. and Bifidobacterium infantis cultures were recovered after fermentation and remaining HMOs were purified, reduced and profiled by MALDI-RTICR-MS as previously described by LoCascio et al (19). Consumption of 14 neutral oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization from 4 to 12 was monitored, representing up to 95% of milk oligosaccharides (2). Table 2 shows the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of the types of sugars analyzed, their composition in hexose, N-acetylhexosamine and fucose residues, degree of polymerization (DP) and the relative concentration of each oligosaccharide in the total HMO pool extracted from multiple samples of human milk, according to the data described by Ninonuevo et al. (2).Masses and Composition of Human Milk Oligosaccharides analyzed. m/z is the mass to charge ratio,Glycoprofiling of Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC15697 confirmed the high metabolic capacity for HMOs of this strain. The consumption profile appeared different to that described in previous work where modified MRS (1.6 % HMO) was used as growth medium (20). When grown in modified ZMB1 with 2% HMO, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC15697 show significant consumption of highly fucosylated structures with a high degree of polymerization (DP), a phenotype not witnessed previously in the MRS grown cells (20). Interestingly, the relative consumption of oligosaccharides with two (m/z 1024.36, 1389.50, 1754.63) and three (m/z 1535.55 and 1900.69) fucose residues was higher than the corresponding monofucosylated (m/z 878.31, 1243.44, 1608.57, 1973.70) or non-fucosylated oligosaccharides (m/z 732.25, 1097.97, 1462.52) (Figure 1). In addition, Bifidobacterium infantis did not completely consume glycans with DP ≤ 7 (m/z 732.25, 878.31, 1097.39, 1243.44 and 1389.50), which constitute almost 70% of the total HMO pool. Thus, in this culture medium, the total consumption of HMOs from the initial pool ranges from 45 to 65%. The data contrast with the complete utilization of these small polymers when Bifidobacterium infantis is grown in modified MRS (20). Moreover, Bifidobacterium infantis manifested a strong ability to catabolize specific oligosaccharides with DP>7. These results reinforce the concept that Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC15697 has the ability to consume the wide range of structures present in the HMO pool.Human milk oligosaccharide consumption profiles of Bifidobacterium infantis, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides vulgatus in modified ZMB1 (2% HMO), as determined using MALDI-FTICR MS. Asterisks represents number of fucose residues on the specific oligosaccharide depicted by the mass/charge ratio (m/z).Bacteroides fragilis ATCC2585 show the highest HMOs consumption rates from all bacteria analyzed, ranging from 25 to 90% (Figure 1), nearly depleting all structures from the HMO pool with high degree of polymerization. Oligosaccharides with lower DP (m/z 732.25, 878.32, 1024), corresponding to tetra, penta and hexasaccharides, were partially metabolized from 40% to 70%. Unlike Bifidobacterium infantis, Bacteroides fragilis exhibited a glycan utilization pattern where the relative utilization of non-fucosylated glycans (m/z values 735.21, 1097.38, 1462.51 and 1827.64) was higher than the consumption of fucosylated oligosaccharides. Indeed, the relative consumption of fucosylated glycans by Bacteroides fragilis decreased as the number fucose residues increased on the HMO structure.Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482 exhibited a moderate growth phenotype on HMOs (ΔOD of 0.66), and the consumption of individual glycans ranges from 16 to 40%. For this strain, no selectivity was observed regarding the degree of polymerization, and the higher consumption rates were those found for highly fucosylated species (m/z value of 1535 and 1901). Bacteroides vulgatus can partially consume all available HMO species, however with noticeably lower efficiency than B. fragilis (Figure 1). Differences between these two Bacteroides strains were also witnessed in the growth kinetics. Bacteroides fragilis exhibited a growth rate of 0.052 per hour in HMOs while Bacteriodes vulgatus had a rate of 0.028 hr−1. Oligosaccharide utilization by Bacteroides vulgatus is quite similar to the level of consumption observed by LoCascio et al (19) for bifidobacteria classified as low-HMO consumers.While breast milk constitutes the dominant nutritional source for newborns and infants during the first months of life, the bioactive effects of various milk components are poorly understood. HMOs constitute one of the most abundant molecules provided by the mother to the newborn through lactation. The high concentration of bifidobacteria in feces from breast-fed infant and the high concentration of HMOs in mother’s breast milk have suggested a “prebiotic” role of these components, which are thought to promote a predominantly bifidobacterial microbiota in the infant gut (16). In vitro analyses has shown that several bifidobacterial species can grow on HMOs, and the genome of Bifidobacterium infantis revealed clusters of glycosidases and oligosaccharide transporters, likely linked to HMOs utilization by this phylotype (7, 19, 20). However, there has been little examination of consumption of HMOs by other bacterial species, including those commonly found in the infant gut.When comparing sugar consumption by many different species, an optimum situation is to use a common medium in which one can manipulate the sugar source. Unfortunately the requirements of intestinal microbes are diverse and, as a consequence, rich (complex) medium components such as beef or yeast extract often are added to the “common” growth medium. However, as shown in Supplemental Figure 1, complex components can bias the results by allowing significant background growth even in the absence of sugar. For that reason, we suggest that a chemically-defined medium that supports good cell growth is a better choice for the study of HMOs consumption by the selected microbes. ZMB1 medium, originally designed for Lactococcus lactis consists of known quantities of trace elements and vitamins, as well as defined nitrogen and carbon sources. The data presented in Table 1 show that ZMB1 generates high cell density in all the strains evaluated, with minor background growth in same medium lacking a sugar source.This work demonstrates that HMOs consumption is not an exclusive property of specific strains of bifidobacteria. Two species of Bacteroides are able to metabolize free glycans from breast milk, growing to moderate or high cell densities. Bacteroides is known for its incredible ability to ferment an extend assortment of plant polysaccharides (23, 24), and some species, such as B. fragilis, for its capability of consume host-derived glycoconjugates found in the mucus gel layer from the gastrointestinal cells (25). Intestinal glycans are similar to the structures of HMOs, containing N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, fucose, sialic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine (25). Thus, as most of Bacteroides can consume host-glycans, it is perhaps not surprising that they can also consume HMOs. Overall, Bacteroides fragilis ATCC25285 was the most efficient in the metabolism of HMOs, and its glycan consumption pattern exhibits a trend for preferential degradation of non-fucosylated HMO species and longer oligosaccharides. Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482 exhibited a lower consumption of these sugars than Bacteroides fragilis. It is interesting to note that Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482 has been revealed as moderate consumer of host-glycans and polysaccharides, which could be extended to its ability to consume HMOs (26). The potential ability for consuming HMOs by Bacteroides was suggested by Bjursell et al. (23), after a transcriptomic-based in silico reconstruction of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron carbohydrate metabolism, using data obtained in the study of gnotobiotic suckling mice.As we have previously demonstrated (19, 20), our results indicate that Bifidobacterium infantis metabolizes HMOs. However, the use of the chemically-defined media ZMB1 reveals that Bifidobacterium infantis can consume the fucosylated glycans, ability not observed when B. infantis was grown on rich media (MRS). In addition, Bifidobacterium infantis growth on modified ZMB1 indicated consumption for glycans of all sizes similar to what that witnessed previously on MRS using limiting levels of HMOs (19).We hypothesize that the consumption differences between the studied strains are related to the specificity of the enzymes involved in cleaving and importing the complex oligosaccharides. Genomic comparisons of Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC15697, Bacteroides fragilis ATCC25285, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482 and the low HMO-consumer Bifidobacterium longum DJO10A (20) show differences in the number of genes related to glycoside hydrolases families (GHFs) (Figure 2). A closer examination of the genomes using CAZy database (27) reveals that Bacteroides fragilis ATCC25285 and Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8482 have differences in the number of genes that encode glycoside hydrolases genes, with 126 and 159 respectively. The fact that Bacteroides vulgatus genome encodes larger number of cleaving enzymes suggests that differences found in the growth curves and HMOs consumption analysis are derived from cleavage specificities. Differences between these two Bacteroides strains were previously found in the analysis of their host-glycan consumption (26). The genome of Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC332 encodes 42 glycosidehydrolases, which is far lower than the number of carbohydrate cleaving enzymes found in the genomes of the Bacteroides species used in this work. However, the genome of Bifidobacterium infantis encloses specific loci seemingly designed for HMOs import and consumption (7), thus explaining the HMOs growth phenotype of this strain. Conversely, the low HMO consumer Bifidobacterium longum DJO10A (20) does not have any fucosidase (GHF29, GHF95) or sialidases (GHF33), which are directly related to the consumption of specific types of HMOs.Annotated genes coding for some carbohydrate active enzymes in the genomes of Bacteroides fragilis ATCC25285, Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC8483, Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC15697 and Bifidobacterium longum DJO10A, as it is described at the CAZy database (http://www.cazy.org) (27). The glycoside hydrolase families (GHF) shown are potentially related to the degradation of HMOs, and they include the following activities: GH2, α-galactosidase; GH3, β-N-Acetylgalactosaminidase; GH20, β-hexosaminidase; GH27, α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase; GH29, α-L-fucosidase; GH33, sialidase; GH42, β-galactosidase; GH95, α-1,2-L-fucosidase.Studies of the influence of breast-feeding in the intestinal microbiota of newborns and infants reveal that breast-fed subjects develop a microbiota rich in bifidobacteria (28, 29). Other anaerobes such as clostridia and Bacteroides are present in lower concentration, and facultative anaerobes such as enterococci or E. coli are even less numerous (30). In contrast to breast-fed infants, formula-fed infants are often colonized by a more diverse microbiota (29, 31). Among the all the components in human milk, such as proteins, lactose, or nucleotides, HMOs are the only ones which have been proved to play an important role in the stimulation of the growth of specific bacterial species (32). In this work, the clostridia, eubacteria, enterococci and Escherichia coli strains were revealed as non-HMO consumers, reinforcing the concept that HMOs could enhance the growth of specific groups of bacteria in the gut. Such selectively also helps explain why enterococci, often the initial colonizers of the newborn gut, are commonly replaced by bifidobacteria, within the first few weeks of breast-feeding (16). Even though a set of 18 isolates represents a small subset of the gut microbiome, in vitro analysis of the growth of different intestinal species in HMOs, combined with an in-depth analysis of oligosaccharide consumption profiles, constitutes the first and necessary step toward understanding the role of this breast milk component. The results obtained provide a basis for future in vivo studies, in order to understand the shifts in infant intestinal microbiota and a possible competition between Bacteroides and bifidobacterial populations during lactation.We are grateful to Dr. Fred Breidt at the USDA–ARS for the Bacterial Growth Kinetics Software package.This publication was made possible in part by grant support from the University of California Discovery Grant Program, the California Dairy Research Foundation, USDA NRI-CSREES Award 2008-35200-18776 and NIH ({""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HD059127"",""term_id"":""300429668""}}HD059127).Supporting Information Available: Supporting information includes growth curves as well as kinetic parameters of the species in complex media.

Using a new scheme for noise reduction in pyrosequencing data, we estimated the total diversity of species-level bacterial phylotypes in the 1.2-1.5 million bacterial 16S rRNA reads obtained from each deeply sampled cotwin to be ~800 (35.9%, 49.1% detected in both). A combined 1.1 million read 16S rRNA dataset representing 281 shallowly sequenced fecal samples from 54 twin pairs and their mothers contained an estimated 4,018 species-level phylotypes, with each sample having a unique species assemblage (53.4 ± 0.6% and 50.3 ± 0.5% overlap with the deeply sampled cotwins). Of the 134 phylotypes with a relative abundance of >0.1% in the combined dataset, only 37 appeared in >50% of the samples, with one phylotype in the Lachnospiraceae family present in 99%. Nongut communities had significantly reduced overlap with the deeply sequenced twins’ fecal microbiota (18.3 ± 0.3%, 15.3 ± 0.3%). The MZ cotwins’ fecal DNA was deeply sequenced (3.8-6.3 Gbp/sample) and assembled reads were assigned to 25 genus-level phylogenetic bins. Only 17% of the genes in these bins were shared between the cotwins. Bins exhibited differences in their degree of sequence variation, gene content including the repertoire of carbohydrate active enzymes present within and between twins (e.g., predicted cellulases, dockerins), and transcriptional activities. These results provide an expanded perspective about features that make each of us unique life forms and directions for future characterization of our gut ecosystems.Human microbiome projects are being initiated throughout the world, with the goal of correlating human physiological phenotypes with the structures and functions of their indigenous microbial communities. Substantial insight into the patterns of variation in the microbiota between body habitats and individuals has been gained using shallow sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and community DNA. Because of limitations imposed by sequencing costs and throughput, these studies have examined the more abundant species or genes. A timely question is this: What additional insights about the microbial diversity present within a body habit are obtained with deeper sequencing? Moreover, how much of the observed organismal diversity is an artifact of noise introduced during PCR and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes (1–3)? Therefore, in the current study we use a variety of experimental and computational approaches to explore the level of diversity and interpersonal variation in bacterial phylotypes, microbial genes, and their expressed mRNA transcripts within the human gut, home to our largest community of microorganisms.Total community DNA and RNA was initially isolated from two fecal samples, each obtained from 26-year-old, obese, MZ female cotwins (body mass index, 39 and 45 kg/m2). Both cotwins (designated TS28 and TS29) had been vaginally delivered; neither cotwin had any history of intestinal disease, and neither had used antibiotics at least 6 months before providing fecal samples, at which time the cotwins lived 5 km apart (4). A 454 pyrosequencing method was used to obtain 1.2–1.5 million sequencing reads from PCR-amplified V2 regions of bacterial 16S rRNA genes present in each fecal sample (average read length ∼232 nt), and 3.8–6.3 Gbp of single- and paired-end shotgun reads from total fecal community DNA (Table S1). Using a method for rRNA depletion based on a combination of size selection (to remove 5S rRNA and tRNA), and streptavidin bead-based pull-down of biotinylated oligonucleotides hybridized to domains conserved among gut bacterial rRNA genes (5), we enriched for fecal mRNA and then generated 12–16 million sequencing reads representing expressed genes in their microbiomes (Table S2).We analyzed test datasets composed of an unequal mixture of DNA from 90 cloned bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences (2) or DNA purified from 67 bacterial strains cultured from the human gut and pooled together over a range of relative concentrations (Table S3). These test datasets were used to establish a set of procedures for removing noise from 16S rRNA datasets that arise from PCR and pyrosequencing (SI Text).Using these procedures, we determined that most species-level phylotypes were present at low abundance [species defined as organisms sharing ≥97% sequence identity (%ID) in their 16S rRNA genes; Fig. S1]; ∼100,000 16S rRNA sequences were required to observe 60% of the total phylotypes (Fig. 1A). At the 95%ID and 97%ID phylotype cutoffs, rarefaction curves did not completely saturate even when >106 sequences were collected (Fig. 1A), indicating that additional phylotypes remain uncharacterized even at this high level of coverage.Measurements of bacterial diversity in the human fecal microbiota. (A) Rarefaction curves at 97%ID and 95%ID phylotype cutoffs are shown for the deeply sequenced TS28 and TS29 MZ cotwin (“Deep Twins”) datasets. Sequences were classified as chimeric at the 50% probability cutoff. (B) Comparison of diversity within and between gut microbial communities. Curves at 97%ID phylotype cutoff are shown for 250 fecal samples taken from 146 individuals (“Shallow twins”; 1,000 16S rRNA gene sequences were randomly selected from each sample), 250 samples taken from multiple body habitats (“Whole body”; 1,000 randomly selected sequences per sample), and the two deeply sequenced fecal samples (“TS28-Deep” and “TS29-Deep”). Phylotypes found in multiple fecal samples are labeled “co-occurring.” (C) Plot of proportion of 97%ID phylotypes found in TS28 and TS29 across 277 fecal samples (black circles) and 814 samples taken from multiple body habitats in nine individuals [habitat groups are colored green (fecal), purple (skin), red (external auditory canal; EAC), blue (hair), orange (nostrils), and light blue (oral cavity)]. Four EAC and one skin sample did not contain any shared phylotypes with TS28 and TS29. (D) The proportion of the 250 fecal samples containing each 97%ID phylotype plotted as a function of the relative abundance (%) of each phylotype in the combined dataset. Phylotypes are colored according to phylum: Bacteroidetes (red), Firmicutes (green), and other (black). The expected proportion of samples containing each phylotype, assuming a random distribution across samples, is shown (median ± 95% confidence interval).The total estimated diversity of species-level bacterial phylotypes (97%ID) in the TS28 and TS29 datasets was lower than expected (878 and 768, respectively; Table 1 and Table S4), based on previous studies that did not account for noise. There was notable variation even between these genetically identical cotwins: 35.9% and 49.1% of the species-level phylotypes found in the fecal communities of TS28 and TS29, respectively, were shared between the two samples (39.0% and 52.8% were shared at the 95%ID level).Number of species-level (97%ID) and 95%ID bacterial phylotypes in the deep and shallow sequenced fecal microbiota of twins, and in the whole body sampling datasetsaChao’s nonparametric total diversity estimates are given. Phylotypes are grouped based on the degree of sequence identity in the V2 regions of their 16S rRNA genes.TS28- and TS29-Deep, deeply sequenced cotwin fecal samples; TS28- and TS29-Shallow, shallow sequenced cotwin fecal samples; TSAll-Shallow, 1,000 randomly selected sequences from 250 fecal samples; TSAll-Co-occur, restricted to co-occurring sequences from 250 fecal samples; WholeBody, 250 randomly selected samples from a total of 814 samples obtained from 27 body sites from 9 individuals, 1,000 sequences/sample).However, these values do not account for phylotypes that may be abundant in one sample and rare in another. Overall, shared phylotypes showed a small but positive correlation in relative abundance between samples, and rarely varied by more than two orders of magnitude (R2 = 0.18 for 97%ID and R2 = 0.27 for 95%ID). This observation allowed us to define a normalized overlap between the samples by considering only phylotypes found at a sufficient relative abundance in each sample that they are unlikely to have been missed because of variations in their relative abundance (“Normalized overlap” in SI Text). With this normalization, 68% and 79% of 97%ID phylotypes in TS28 and TS29 were designated as being shared in the other cotwin's microbiota (76.7% and 86.0% at 95%ID).To test whether the deep sampling of these cotwins allowed us to capture the bacterial diversity present in fecal samples obtained from other families containing twins, we extended our survey to include 1.1 million bacterial V2 16S rRNA sequencing reads from 281 fecal samples procured from 31 MZ and 23 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs and their mothers [3,984 ± 232 (mean ± SEM) reads/sample] (4). Like the deeply sampled cotwins, these other twin pairs were born in Missouri, ranged in age from 25 to 32 years, did not have a history of GI pathology, and had not consumed antibiotics before sampling. All 16S rRNA pyrosequencing reads were preprocessed as done above to remove noise and chimeras.A comparison of the total bacterial diversity found across these fecal samples and the two deeply sequenced samples underscored the much higher level of inter- compared with intrapersonal variation when considering a single body habitat (Fig. 1B). The combined “Shallow” fecal datasets had an estimated 4,018 97%ID phylotypes and 2,498 95%ID phylotypes (2,815 and 1,974 observed, respectively). These values are ∼5-fold higher than in each deeply sequenced fecal microbiota (Table 1). In addition, each sample had a unique collection of 97%ID phylotypes (mean ± SEM, 53.4 ± 0.6% and 50.3 ± 0.5% overlap with TS28 and TS29), whereas the fraction of phylotypes from each sample that were shared with TS28 correlated with the fraction shared with TS29 (R2 = 0.73; Fig. 1C).Our initial analysis of these fecal samples had indicated that there was no core set of abundant species-level phylotypes found in all individuals (4); this was confirmed after removing PCR and sequencing noise. The proportion of samples containing each phylotype was lower than expected by chance at all levels of relative abundance (Fig. 1D), but within each level of abundance there was a large spread. Only a few phylotypes appeared in the majority of samples: of the 134 species-level phylotypes that had a relative abundance in the combined dataset >0.1%, only 37 appeared in >50% of the samples (28% of the phylotypes, compared with 100% expected by chance). Phylotypes assigned to the Firmicutes phylum were more evenly spread than the Bacteroidetes: 33% with >0.1% relative abundance appeared in 50% of samples, compared with only 12% of the Bacteroidetes phylotypes (Fig. 1D). In addition, one nearly ubiquitous phylotype belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae (phylum Firmicutes) was found in 99% of the samples, representing 5.7% of the sequences in the combined dataset.To determine whether phylotypes present in the gut microbiota were detectable in other body habitats, we surveyed V2 16S rRNA sequencing reads obtained from nine unrelated healthy individuals (male and female) who had been sampled at 27 sites, including feces, twice over a 24-h period on two occasions, each occasion separated by 3 months (age range, 30–35 years with the exception of one individual 60 years of age; no recent history of antibiotic use; mean ± SD 1,315 ± 420 reads per sample) (6). All data were subjected to the same denoising procedures described above.A comparison of the total diversity found across the 27 body habitats to the shallowly sequenced fecal samples and the two deeply sequenced fecal samples demonstrated higher levels of diversity when comparing across multiple body habitats vs. comparisons of the same habitat across multiple individuals (Fig. 1B). The combined 27-body habitats dataset contained an estimated 4,949 species-level phylotypes (97%ID) and 3,646 95%ID phylotypes (3,869 and 2,957 observed, respectively) (Table 1). Although the range of overlapping species-level phylotypes for the fecal samples from the 27-body habitat survey was comparable to the twin fecal cohort (mean± SEM 45.1 ± 1.9% and 41.7 ± 1.4%), the other nongut body habitats showed a significantly reduced overlap (mean ± SEM 18.3 ± 0.3% and 15.3 ± 0.3% with TS28 and TS29; P < 10−17, Student's t test; Fig. 1C). As with the fecal samples from the shallowly sampled twins, the fraction of phylotypes from each sample that were shared with TS28 correlates with the fraction shared with TS29 (R2 = 0.42).Together, these results emphasize the following: (i) despite large interpersonal variations in the composition of the gut microbiota and the absence of a core set of abundantly represented universally shared phylotypes, common phylotypes can be identified through deep sequencing of a small number of individuals; (ii) a surprising amount of phylotypes are shared between distinct body habitats across unrelated individuals (i.e., only five samples did not contain any phylotypes from the deeply sequenced TS28 and TS29 gut microbial communities); and (iii) it seems feasible that future studies that broadly sample humans living in distinct cultural settings will be able to define population-wide gut phylotypes and, as a result, provide a rationale for selecting cultured representatives of these phylotypes for genome sequencing (e.g., start with phylotypes in the top right portion of Fig. 1D).We turned next to the following questions: Does deep sequencing enable the assembly and binning of “population genomes” from complex microbial communities? How diverse is the gut microbiome in terms of gene content. and how unique are these genes relative to those contained in 122 genomes from cultured human gut isolates? What can we infer about the similarities and differences between MZ cotwins when interrogating their deeply sequenced microbiomes?Deep shotgun sequencing of total fecal community DNA allowed us to assemble and bin large scaffolds from the TS28 and TS29 microbiomes (Tables S5 and S6 and Phylogenetic binning of microbiome scaffolds in SI Text). A combined assembly of single- and paired-end pyrosequencing reads from TS28 and TS29 yielded 92,104 and 61,460 contigs >500 bp per sample, with 11,780 and 6,392 scaffolds, respectively (scaffolds represent one or more contigs ordered and oriented using paired-end reads). PhyloPythia, a phylogenetic classifier that uses a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) for composition-based characterization of sequence fragments at different taxonomic ranks (7), was trained on 1,775 finished or draft microbial genomes, in addition to 5,548 and 3,391 contigs from TS28 and TS29, respectively, that mapped with high confidence to gut microbial genomes (Table S7). After training, PhyloPythia was used to accurately bin all scaffolds >2 Kbp at the genus- and family-level, resulting in 24–25 bins of scaffolds per fecal sample; these bins contained from 2.0 Kbp to 22.4 Mbp of total sequence (Figs. S2B and S3 and Table S6).The total number of genes across all microbiome bins from the TS28 and TS29 fecal samples was 88,316 and 64,453, respectively. Clustering of protein sequences from these bins and the 122 gut microbial genomes, revealed 180,550, 257,823, and 334,211 total protein-coding gene clusters at 40%, 60%, and 80% identity cutoffs, respectively (Fig. 2A and Fig. S2A). The largest group of gene clusters at all cutoffs was unique to the reference genomes, whereas 25% of the clusters were found only in the TS28 or TS29 microbiome bins. Overall, 36% of the gut microbiome gene clusters had a representative (60%ID) in the 122 gut microbial genome database, indicating that although sequencing reference genomes from culturable members of the microbiota has already uncovered a substantial proportion of the gene content present in the fecal communities of these cotwins, more reference genome and microbiome sequencing is clearly needed.Diversity of the human fecal microbiome and its metatranscriptome. (A) Distribution of gene clusters across gut microbial genomes and microbiome bins. All protein sequences from 122 gut genomes and the microbiome bins were clustered using cd-hit at 60%ID. (B) Number of sequence variants in each microbiome bin (values normalized by Gbp in bin; all genus-level bins with >100 scaffolds are shown). (C) Rarefaction analysis of the number of genes, gene clusters, expressed genes, and expressed gene clusters in the fecal microbial communities of TS28 and TS29 as a function of sequencing depth. The total number of protein-coding genes in the set of 122 gut genomes and the microbiome bins is 525,329, representing 257,823 gene clusters. (D) Ratio of gene expression to gene abundance (relative abundance of cDNA sequences divided by relative abundance of DNA sequences) mapped to a subset of the bacterial taxa in the fecal microbiome. Taxa with >1,000 mapped cDNA and DNA sequencing reads in both samples are shown.A total of 25 genus- and family-level bins were identified in the TS28 fecal microbiome dataset, and 24 in the TS29 dataset; 22 of these bins were found in both samples (bins unique to one sample only contained nine of the 16,554 total scaffolds). There were strong correlations between the two fecal microbiomes with respect to the number of scaffolds, their aggregate length, and the number of genes found in each bin (R2 = 0.94, 0.74, and 0.69, respectively; Table S6). As expected from our bacterial 16S rRNA analyses, the genus-level bins with the largest number of scaffolds were the Ruminococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Eubacterium (members of the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla). However, substantial assemblies were also obtained from Methanobrevibacter [M. smithii is reported to be the dominant archaeon in the human gut microbiome; (8)] and from Bifidobacterium (the former is missed with primers for amplification of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, whereas the current version of V2-directed bacterial primers miss members of the latter taxa; Fig. S4). When sequencing reads from each sample were mapped to the microbiome bins from that sample to identify high-confidence sequence variants in each bin, we found that the Faecalibacterium had the highest relative level of variation, whereas the Methanobrevibacter had the lowest (Fig. 2B).Taken together, these results suggest that “population genomes” can be constructed and reliably binned even from diverse microbial communities given enough sequencing depth, although rare members of the community will be missed (e.g., the TM7 phylum). The bins provided the basis for a more in-depth analysis, annotation, and transcriptional profiling than a standard gene-centric (i.e., sequencing read–based) approach, revealing 36,151 and 24,134 gene clusters unique to TS28 and TS29, respectively, and not represented in any of the 122 reference gut genomes (Fig. 2A). Comparisons of the abundance of shared clusters between TS28 and TS29 revealed a stronger average correlation than the shared species-level phylotypes (mean R2 = 0.37 vs. R2 = 0.18). Rarefaction analysis disclosed that the number of genes and gene clusters in the gut microbiomes continues to increase even after 2 million mapped reads (Fig. 2C), with an estimated plateau of 242,023 and 234,661 genes, corresponding to 115,216 and 112,522 gene clusters in the TS28 and TS29 fecal microbiomes, respectively (Table S8).The human genome lacks the large repertoire of glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases required to cleave the many glycosidic linkages present in complex dietary polysaccharides (9). Because processing of these polysaccharides is a major function of the distal gut microbiota (10), we annotated the predicted proteins from each genus- and family-level microbiome bin using procedures described in the Carbohydrate-Active EnZyme database [CAZy (9)] (Table S9 and S10 and Fig. S5). In total, we observed 143 CAZy families representing 5,145 genes in the gut microbiomes of these cotwins.In general, the relative abundance of genes assigned to each CAZy family was consistent across genus-level bins from both individuals (Fig. 3A and Table S10). However, one notable exception was found: the Faecalibacterium bin from TS28 contained 42 genes predicted to encode dockerins, which are small proteins involved in the assembly of extracellular cellulosomes (11). None of these genes were identified in the Faecalibacterium bin from her cotwin's fecal microbiome, nor in the genome of F.prausnitzii isolate M21/2. However, 30 dockerins were identified across the Ruminococcus and Eubacterium bins of the two samples (Table S9). In agreement with the predicted formation of cellulosomes, the Faecalibacterium dockerins from TS28 were found with a number of genes predicted to encode cellulases (GH5,GH9,GH44,GH48), beta-mannanases (GH26), xyloglucanases (GH74), and polysaccharide lyases (PL), none of which were observed in the Faecalibacterium bin from TS29 (χ2 test, P < 10−4). Finally, a cohesin-encoding gene (the cognate molecule for dockerins) was identified in the Faecalibacterium bin from TS28, further supporting the existence of human gut cellulosomes.Clustering of fecal microbiome bins and the annotation of differentially expressed genes. (A) UPGMA clustering was performed on the relative abundance of CAZy families across each microbiome bin. Number of genes assigned to each CAZy family was normalized to the total number of genes in each sequence bin (all bins with >30 CAZy family assignments in both samples are shown). Black circles represent clustered nodes after z-score normalization across all bins (inconsistency threshold = 0.75, “cluster” function in Matlab v7.7.0). (B) Percentage of genes with high relative expression (High-Expr) or low relative expression (Low-Expr) assigned to each COG category. Percentages are represented by the area of each circle (black circle labeled 5% provides reference).To assess the distribution of genes predicted to encode dockerins across microbiomes from other twins, we compared 18 fecal microbiome datasets (mean ± SEM 535,232 ± 23,294 sequencing reads per sample; 118.7 ± 8.7 Mb/sample) obtained from six MZ twin-pairs and their mothers (4) to the protein-coding gene sequences from the microbiome bins obtained from the deeply sampled MZ twins. This analysis revealed that the identified dockerin-encoding genes are widely distributed across gut microbiomes but vary in abundance: all 18 microbiomes contained reads with significant sequence similarity to these genes (mean number of genes 12.4, range 1–55 genes; and mean number of sequencing reads 54.3, range 2–222 reads). However, only sequences from TS28 contained reads matching the identified cohesin-encoding gene.Together, these results expand the known diversity of CAZymes in the human gut microbiome and reveal a suite of genes with predicted cellulolytic activity. The fact that the latter genes were highly enriched in the Faecalibacterium bins found in the microbiome of TS28 and not in her genetically identical cotwin highlights another level of genetic variation between humans. Future research will be necessary to characterize the enzymatic activity of these systems, the breadth of their organismal distribution, the host and environmental parameters (including diet) that determine their abundance in a given human gut microbiome, and their contributions to host nutrient/energy harvest.To characterize gene expression in the gut microbiome, we analyzed cDNA and DNA datasets obtained from sequencing total community cDNA and DNA prepared from the two fecal samples of TS28 and TS29. All sequencing reads were mapped against the database of 122 gut microbial genomes and the microbiome bins (Metatranscriptome analysis in SI Text). The results revealed marked differences in gene abundance and expression (Figs. S6 and S7). In all cases, technical replicates of each microbiome and metatranscriptome (n = 3–4) clustered together; this clustering was robust to subsampling by COG functional categories (Fig. S6). Microbiome profiles showed the highest average correlation between individuals (R2 = 0.37), relative to metatranscriptomes (R2 = 0.12) and the relative abundance of species-level phylotypes (R2 = 0.18). As with the microbiome, rarefaction analysis of the metatranscriptome revealed that the number of expressed genes and gene clusters continues to increase even after 500,000 mapped reads (Fig. 2C), with an estimated plateau of 85,099 and 173,309 genes, corresponding to 35,781 and 58,339 gene clusters in TS28 and TS29, respectively (Table S8).We subsequently calculated the ratio of the relative abundance of cDNA sequences in each microbiome bin to the relative abundance of DNA sequences in that bin, for each fecal community (12). Even at the genus-level, there were detectable differences in relative gene expression: six bins showed higher relative expression than gene abundance, whereas the Bifidobacterium had the lowest level of relative expression in both microbiomes (Fig. 2D).We then compared cDNA and DNA profiles at the level of individual genes to determine the relative expression of each gene compared with its abundance (12). Genes were defined as “High Relative Expression” (High-Expr) or Low-Expr based on the ratio of cDNA to DNA relative abundance. A 10-fold difference was chosen as the threshold cutoff based on all pairwise comparisons of technical replicate datasets obtained from cDNA or DNA sequencing of each sample (Fig. S8A,
 n = 3–4 replicates per sample per method).These comparisons revealed 6,961 genes with high or low relative expression in the fecal microbiome of TS28 (4,816 High-Expr and 2,145 Low-Expr) and 7,893 genes in TS29 (5,476 High-Expr and 2,417 Low-Expr; Tables S11 and S12). As expected, many of these genes came from bins with an overall higher relative expression (Fig. 2D), including Parabacteroides, Alistipes, Methanobrevibacter, and Bacteroides, or bins with a lower relative expression (the Bifidobacterium bin contained 962 Low-Expr genes in sample TS29 and 112 in TS28). However, some notable exceptions were found; the Bacteroides had 1,416 High-Expr genes in the TS28 microbiome, despite having overall similar levels of cDNA and DNA assignments across the entire bin (ratio 1.5).The distribution of genes assigned to COG functional categories was then calculated using each set of High- or Low-Expr genes (Fig. 3B), as well as the set of genes that were observed only with cDNA or DNA sequencing (Fig. S9A). A disproportionate number of High-Expr genes encoded hypothetical proteins without predicted functions [33.9% (TS28) and 31.2% (TS29) of the High-Expr genes, comprising 77.9% (TS28) and 75.1% (TS29) of the total hypothetical genes with either a high or low relative expression]. High-Expr genes from both microbiomes were more frequently assigned to COG categories for translation (J), energy metabolism (C), and chaperones (O) (Fig. 3B and Tables S11 and S12), whereas Low-Expr genes were more frequently assigned to COG categories for secretory systems (U), replication, recombination, and repair (L), and membrane proteins (M) (Fig. 3B). In addition, many of these High-Expr genes have predicted functions related to fermentation and carbohydrate metabolism: e.g., ABC-type transport systems for carbohydrate import and metabolism plus genes involved in methanogenesis and acetogenesis (key pathways in the clearance of the hydrogen end-product of fermentation, and thus important determinants of fermentation efficiency).To better characterize specific pathways represented by genes with high or low relative expression, we annotated each gene in the 122 gut microbial genomes and the microbiome bins using the KEGG annotation scheme (v52) (13). The relative abundance of KEGG pathways was tallied across genes defined as High- or Low-Expr in TS28 and TS29 or found to be unique to the cDNA or DNA datasets, and used for UPGMA clustering. Both microbiomes showed consistent trends, including high relative expression of genes assigned to pathways for essential cell processes, e.g., “RNA polymerase,” “Ribosome,” “Pyruvate metabolism,” and “Glycolysis” (Fig. S8B). We extended these analyses to five additional samples from two sets of MZ cotwins and one unrelated individual (Samples labeled “TSDA” in Fig. S9 and Additional microbiomes and meta-transcriptomes in SI Text) and found similar results, including the higher relative expression of genes assigned to COG categories for transcription, energy metabolism, defense mechanisms, and chaperones (Fig. S9A), in addition to KEGG pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism (e.g., fructose/mannose metabolism), nucleotide metabolism, and vitamin metabolism/biosynthesis (e.g., folate biosynthesis) (Fig. S9B).Our results indicate that a majority of species-level phylotypes are shared between these deeply sampled MZ cotwins, despite large variations in the abundance of each phylotype. The genetic and transcriptional diversity of the human gut microbiome is remarkable. Much of this diversity has not been previously identified through sequencing cultured human gut isolates; 64% of the gene clusters present in our microbiome bins had no representative in a set of 122 human gut microbial genomes, and only 17% were shared between the two cotwins. This diversity, even between genetically identical individuals, provides an expanded view of our multicellularity and interpersonal genetic variation. Features of the genus-level bins within the gut microbiome were distinctive in many ways, ranging from differences in gene content and transcriptional activity, to the extent of sequence variation within each population. Identifying the factors that determine such between-taxon differences will provide an important step toward understanding the functions (niches) of these organisms in the human gut microbial community, with the ultimate goal of linking the presence of specific organisms to gene content and activity. Our results and the accompanying datasets also provide a framework for future studies of human and environmental microbiomes. As noted above, 16S rRNA gene sequence datasets can be used to prioritize genomes for isolation and sequencing, starting with the most abundant phylotypes found across the most individuals, and working toward the rare members of the gut microbiota. The reduced level of organismal diversity in a single individual implies that it may be soon be possible to identify all strains present in a single gut (fecal) microbiota. The fraction of shared phylotypes between MZ cotwins, between unrelated individuals, and between body habitats provides an important context for designing studies of the assembly, dynamic operations, and host effects of “model” human gut microbiota/microbiomes, composed of sequenced cultured gut isolates, in gnotobiotic mice. Finally, the application of transcriptional profiling to the study of human body habitat-associated microbial communities will enable correlations to be made between genes expressed by our microbiomes and our physiologic and metabolic phenotypes.Fecal samples were stored at −80°C before processing. DNA was extracted by bead beating followed by phenol-chloroform extraction as described previously (4). The V2 region was targeted for amplification by PCR (with primers 8F-338R) and multiplex GS FLX pyrosequencing (4). In addition, six control pools were constructed with equimolar or variable concentrations of purified genomic DNA from 67 cultured reference human gut–derived strains; the V2 regions of 16S rRNA genes present in these pools were then amplified and sequenced.Shotgun sequencing runs were performed on libraries prepared from total fecal community DNA using the 454 GS FLX Titanium single- and paired-end protocols. For all analyses involving unassembled reads, sequencing reads with degenerate bases (“Ns”) were removed along with all replicate sequences using the following parameters: 0.9 (90%ID), length difference requirement = 0, and 3 beginning bases checked (14). Each deeply sequenced dataset (TS28 and TS29) was assembled separately using the 454 GS de novo assembler software (Newbler v2.0.00.22), and all scaffolds were used for subsequent analysis. High-confidence sequence variants were identified using the 454 GS Reference Mapper software (v2.0.00.20).Microbial RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed as described previously (5). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from each fecal sample. The sample was subjected to rigorous DNase digestion to remove residual gDNA, depleted for rRNA and tRNA, converted to cDNA, and sequenced using the Illumina GAII platform. A total of 36 nucleotide reads produced from the each run were trimmed at their beginning and ends to remove bases with a quality score <20. Adapter sequences and sequencing reads with a length <20 nucleotides were subsequently eliminated from further analysis. All trimmed reads were mapped with SSAHA2 (15) to phylogenetic bins constructed from microbiome scaffolds and to 122 sequenced human gut-associated microbial genomes (SSAHA2 parameters: -best 1 -score 20 -solexa). Gene clusters were defined by grouping all protein sequences from the database using the program cd-hit [parameter -c 0.6 -n 4 (16)]. Gene and gene cluster counts were normalized based on the total number of mapped sequencing reads. Genes from the database with significant homology (BLASTN e-value <10−30) to noncoding transcripts from the 122 gut microbial genomes were excluded from subsequent analysis. Ties representing sequences matching multiple reference genes with the same score were split evenly, whereas ties matching multiple gene clusters were weighted according to the frequency of unique (nontie) matches to each cluster.Details concerning (i) phylogenetic binning of microbiome scaffolds, (ii) analysis of gene, bin, and transcript abundance, (iii) development and validation of methods for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, and (iv) additional cohorts of humans analyzed are given in SI Text.We thank S.

PMC2873859,A cytoplasmic prolyl hydroxylation and glycosylation pathway modifies Skp1 and regulates O2-dependent development in Dictyostelium,False,"The soil amoeba Dictyostelium is an obligate aerobe that monitors O2 for informational purposes in addition to utilizing it for oxidative metabolism. Whereas low O2 suffices for proliferation, a higher level is required for slugs to culminate into fruiting bodies, and O2 influences slug polarity, slug migration, and cell-type proportioning. Dictyostelium expresses a cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H1) known to mediate O2-sensing in animals, but lacks HIFα, a major hydroxylation target whose accumulation directly induces animal hypoxia-dependent transcriptional changes. The O2-requirement for culmination is increased by P4H1-gene disruption and reduced by P4H1 overexpression. A target of Dictyostelium P4H1 is Skp1, a subunit of the SCF-class of E3-ubiquitin ligases related to the VBC-class that mediates hydroxylation-dependent degradation of animal HIFα. Skp1 is a target of a novel cytoplasmic O-glycosylation pathway that modifies HyPro143 with a pentasaccharide, and glycosyltransferase mutants reveal that glycosylation intermediates have antagonistic effects toward P4H1 in O2-signaling. Current evidence indicates that Skp1 is the only glycosylation target in cells, based on metabolic labeling, biochemical complementation, and enzyme specificity studies. Bioinformatics studies suggest that the HyPro-modification pathway existed in the ancestral eukaryotic lineage and was retained in selected modern day unicellular organisms whose life cycles experience varying degrees of hypoxia. It is proposed that, in Dictyostelium and other protists including the agent for human toxoplasmosis Toxoplasma gondii, prolyl hydroxylation and glycosylation mediate O2-signaling in hierarchical fashion via Skp1 to control the proteome, directly via degradation rather than indirectly via transcription as found in animals.Dictyostelium is a model organism [1] that proliferates in the wild as a unicellular amoeba on a diet of bacteria and yeast in soils throughout the world. Starvation induces the solitary amoebae to aggregate into a multicellular slug, which in response to external cues migrates to the soil surface and culminates into a fruiting body (Fig. 1) [2, 3]. Spores, perched at the top of the fruiting body stalk, have increased likelihood to be dispersed to distant locations where they can germinate to renew the cycle. Since culmination is irreversible [4], the migrating slug must continuously weigh the potential of finding a better location against the cost and risk of further searching. The slug-to-fruit decision is promoted by low NH3 (a metabolic by-product), high O2, light, low humidity, and warmth, which are each characteristic of the above-ground environment where culmination would be optimal [4, 5]. Environmental sensing may occur at the anterior slug tip (colored red in Fig. 1), which has properties of the primary organizer of animal embryos.Dictyostelium development and O2-dependence. Starvation induces Dictyostelium cells to aggregate by chemotaxis and cell-cell adhesion. As depicted here, the tipped aggregate elongates into a slug, and the inherited tip (colored red) coordinates subsequent migration and culmination into a fruiting body. Cell rearrangements are indicated by arrows. During culmination, prestalk cells (Pst, 3 subtypes are denoted as shades of red) migrate down and become stalk cells, and prespore cells (Psp, blue) ascend and become spores. Culmination requires a high level of O2, which evidence suggests signals via the HyPro-modifcation pathway. ALC: anterior-like cells residing in the posterior region. Dictyostelium normally requires only 2.5% O2 for growth, but needs elevated O2 to form slugs in timely fashion, culminate and sporulate (as indicated by green arrows). O2 is also involved in other developmental functions as listed at bottom.Prolyl 4-hydroxylases, first discovered in the rough endoplasmic reticulum as modifiers of collagen in animals and cell wall proteins in plants, have recently been identified in the cytoplasm as regulators of the stability of animal hypoxia inducible factor α (HIFα). HIFα is a subunit of the HIFα-HIFβ transcriptional factor heterodimer which induces hypoxia response genes that support glycolysis, angiogenesis, and erythropoiesis [6]. Hydroxylation of HIFα, promoted by O2 and other factors, allows recognition by the VHL subunit of the E3(VBC)-ubiquitin (Ub)-ligase followed by degradation within the 26S-proteasome (discussed below in Fig. 6A). PHD1-3 (also known as HPHs and EGLNs) are non-heme Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases, and are thought to be able to function as direct O2-sensors because of their relatively high Kms for O2 [6]. They may also be activated by the co-substrate α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a Krebs cycle intermediate, ascorbate, and Fe(II), and inhibited by the product succinate, other Krebs cycle metabolites, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, PHD levels are modulated transcriptionally and by turnover, and possibly also by nuclear compartmentalization. Much remains to be learned about the quantitative regulation of PHDs in cells.Relation of Skp1 hydroxylation/glycosylation to HIF1 hydroxylation. (A) Model depicting the role of O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of animal HIF1α in E3(VBC)Ub-ligase dependent polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. (B) Model describing how, by shifting the target of hydroxylation from a substrate of the Ub-ligase to a subunit of the Ub-ligase, hydroxylation (and subsequent glycosylation) might regulate a larger number of targets. For culmination, hydroxylation or α-galactosylation of Skp1 is inferred to weaken SCF activity (see Fig. 5). Note that the SCF- and VBC-type Ub-ligases are evolutionarily related. The SCF complex consists of cullin-1, Skp1, and an F-box protein; the VBC complex consists of cullin-2, elongin-B, elongin-C, and the von Hippel-Lindau protein. Skp1 is related to elongin-C, but possesses a unique C-terminal extension which carries the glycosylation site.Dictyostelium Skp1 was initially discovered as a novel fucosylated cytoplasmic protein (FP21) [7]. Skp1 is modified by a pentasaccharide, assembled by a novel O-glycosylation pathway (see Fig. 2 below) that is also compartmentalized in the cytoplasm, in contrast to the more usual location of protein O-glycosylation pathways in the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus. Skp1 was subsequently discovered in yeast and mammalian cells as a critical subunit of the SCF-class of E3-Ub-ligases which target cell cycle regulatory proteins and transcriptional factors for degradation in the 26S-proteasome [8]. Skp1 probably has additional functions distinct from E3-Ub-ligases [9, 10], though likely still in association with F-box proteins.Skp1 hydroxylation/glycosylation pathway in Dictyostelium. The enzymes for the first 5 modification steps have been identified and their genes now cloned. gmd, mutated in strain HL250 [21], is required in concert with an epimerase (not shown) to form GDP-Fuc from GDP-Man. αGal-2, whose addition may be mediated by AgtA (see text), is most likely attached to αGal-1 or Fuc. The dotted line indicates that P4H1 and Gnt1 appear to be expressed as a protein fusion in some species (Table 1).The Dictyostelium homolog (P4H1) of animal PHDs was discovered as a modifier of Skp1 and is required for its glycosylation [11]. P4H1 shares many biochemical properties with animal PHDs. As discussed below, genetic and biochemical evidence supports a model in which P4H1-dependent modification of Skp1 comprises an O2-sensing pathway for regulation of development. Dictyostelium lacks HIFα-type transcriptional factors, and Skp1 may be the only substrate of P4H1. The SCF complex, also present in Dictyostelium, is evolutionarily related to the VBC-type E3 Ub-ligase that targets HIFα in animals. We propose that by modifying the Ub-ligase itself rather than one of its substrates, an evolutionarily ancient mechanism of O2-signaling may have involved regulation of the proteome directly by protein turnover.This article reviews underlying tenets of the model, including characteristics of Dictyostelium Skp1, the mechanism of its posttranslational modification, evidence for the role of the hydroxylation/glycosylation pathway in O2-signaling, and possible mechanisms of how the pathway modulates development. Finally, the significance of the Skp1-modification pathway for O2-regulation for other members of protist kingdom, including important vectors of human and agricultural disease, is evaluated.Studies in other organisms indicate Skp1 specifically binds the F-box motif found in the family of F-box proteins [8, 9], which number from 15–700 members in different eukaryotes. A major subset includes SCF complexes, in which Skp1 also binds cullin-1 to form a class of E3-Ub-ligases. E3(SCF)Ub-ligases have been implicated in Dictyostelium development [12]. Cell fractionation shows that about half of Dictyostelium Skp1 is soluble and the remainder sedimentable with the particulate fraction in a salt-sensitive, detergent-insensitive fashion, consistent with a possible cytoskeletal or scaffold association [13]. Although Skp1 does not fractionate with nuclei, immunofluorescence studies reveal a clear nuclear enrichment that is dependent on at least partial glycosylation [14].Dictyostelium Skp1 is glycosylated according to the scheme shown in Fig. 2. The linkage to HyPro143 and the glycan chain structure are supported by Edman degradation and MS fragmentation analyses; the glycan composition is supported by GC-MS and HPAEC [15]; the Galα1,3Fucα1,2Galα1,3 trisaccharide linkages are supported by exoglycosidase sensitivity [15]; the GlcNAcα 1,4Hy(trans)Pro linkage is supported by homologies of the GlcNAcT and P4H1 to known enzymes, and the ability of mAbs prepared against a synthetic GlcNAc 1,4Hy(trans)Pro-peptide to recognize Skp1 (see below); and the Galα1,3Fuc linkage is supported by analysis of the enzyme product by HPLC [16]. αGal-2 is α-linked based on α-galactosidase sensitivity, and timed mild acid hydrolysis suggests that it is linked to either the other α-Gal or Fuc [15]. The core trisaccharide has the same structure as the human type 1 blood group H antigen, but is formed as a result of convergent evolution [17]. NMR studies and molecular dynamics simulations of model compounds show that the core trisaccharide adopts an overlapping ensemble of conformations best represented by a hairpin in which Fuc folds back toward the GlcNAc [18]. Crystal structures of SCF complexes from yeast, animals and plants suggest that the Pro-attachment site occurs at an exposed turn and is not covered by essential contacts with the F-box protein or cullin-1 [19]. However, structures of complexes that include full-length F-box proteins, or other proteins that may associate with Skp1, have not been investigated. Structure predictions suggest that the glycan projects away from the protein (http://glycam.ccrc.uga.edu/), where it may more likely be recognized by a separate binding protein than affect the folding of its own carrier polypeptide.Biochemical studies conducted in vivo and in vitro suggest that Skp1 is the only protein modified by the HyPro pathway (see sections below). The majority (≥90%) of steady-state Skp1 appears to be constitutively glycosylated based on Mr analysis using SDS-PAGE [14, 5], except for possible variation of an outer αGal [13]. 5–10% is not hydroxylated according to assays in which extracts are incubated with recombinant enzymes and radioactive sugar nucleotides [5]. However, this is a minimal estimate because of possible post-lysis modification. The high degree of modification of Skp1 in the steady state suggests a role in a global function of Skp1 such as the Ub(SCF)-ligase.When modestly over-expressed in prespore cells of the slug (see Fig. 1), with a C-terminal c-myc epitope tag, little Skp1-myc is hydroxylated, but becomes hydroxylated/glycosylated when cells are induced to dedifferentiate [14]. In contrast, pre-existing Skp1 in the same cells is predominantly glycosylated, indicative of multiple pools. Therefore, Skp1-myc is stable in prespore cells and hydroxylation appears to be rate-limiting for modification of nascent Skp1 in slugs.If Skp1 is expressed in proliferating cells with an N-terminal FLAG-tag, or with point mutations in its N-terminal domain (the contact region with cullin-1), unmodified and hydroxylated (but not glycosylated) Skp1, and glycoforms lacking one or both αGal residues, accumulate [15; H. van der Wel, C.M. West, unpublished data]. In contrast, similar expression of Skp1 with its wild-type sequence except for a C-terminal tag is glycosylated normally. These results suggest that modification of Skp1 is sensitive to its physical state, but whether this reflects a quality control or regulatory mechanism for the HyPro modification pathway remains to be determined.Dictyostelium expresses two Skp1s, Skp1A and Skp1B, which differ only by the presence of Ser or Ala at codon 39. However, other amoebazoans possessing genes related to the Skp1 modification pathway (see Table 1) appear to have only a single Skp1 gene, with either Thr or Ala at this position. In addition, multiple Skp1s do not always occur in other protists with HyPro pathway-like genes. In Dictyostelium, no differences in Skp1A and Skp1B expression were detected by RT-PCR [14] or analysis of promoter::RFP constructs (H. van der Wel, C.M. West, unpublished data), and both isoforms are similarly glycosylated [20]. The lack of evolutionary conservation and the similar expression profiles suggest that the occurrence of 2 isoforms is not directly pertinent to O2-regulation.Phylogenetic distribution of HyPro-modification pathway-like genesThe equivalent of P143 (the attachment site) is conserved in Skp1s from yeast/fungi, protists, algae, plants, and invertebrates, but not vertebrates. Some organisms have additional Skp1 genes in which P143 is replaced by another amino acid [20]. The equivalent of P143 is replaced by Glu in vertebrate Skp1s which, interestingly, possess a nearby Pro in an identical TPEE sequence motif in a similar secondary structure context. The Mr of Skp1 purified from bovine liver, based on MALDI-ToF-MS, is consistent with the absence of a steady state modification (C. Newsome, C.M. West, unpublished data). A sequence alignment of Skp1s from a broad range of phylogenetic groups did not reveal amino acid identities correlating with the presence of Pro at codon 143, or the occurrence of HyPro modification-like genes in their genomes (unpublished data). The apparent absence of purifying selection suggests that recognition by HyPro pathway enzymes depends on motifs constrained by other conserved functions.The Skp1 prolyl hydroxylase gene (P4H1) was predicted by sequence similarity to animal HIFαPHDs [17], and shown to be required for Skp1 glycosylation based on the effect of gene disruption [11]. Bacterially expressed P4H1 is specific for the modification of Pro143 of Skp1 (unpublished data). P4H1 is dispensable for proliferation but required for development in hypoxia (see below). P4H1 exhibits a Km for O2 of >40%, and is dependent on αKG, and ascorbate, as expected. P4H1 exhibits an unusually high affinity for Fe(II), and is inhibited by compounds that affect mammalian PHDs. Sequence comparisons show P4H1 to be more similar to HIFα-type than collagen-type PHDs, and more similar to 4-PHDs than 3-PHDs [11]. Although only 33% identical to the 120-amino acid catalytic domain of mammalian PHD2, P4H1 is considered to be the Dictyostelium ortholog of HIFα-type PHDs, suggesting that P4H1 catalyzes formation of 4(trans)-hydroxyproline.Gnt1 was purified as a UDP-GlcNAc-dependent polypeptide GlcNAcT capable of modifying HyPro143 of Skp1 in vitro [22]. Protein sequence data was used to clone gnt1 and the recombinant protein exhibited similar activity [23]. However, gnt1 has resisted disruption even in a P4H1-null background (C.M. West et al., unpublished data). Gnt1 was the defining member of its CAZy [24] sequence family (GT60), and mutagenesis studies indicate it to be homologous to the mucin-type polypeptide αGlcNAcT in the Golgi of Dictyostelium, and to CAZy GT27 αGalNAcTs that initiate mucin-type O-glycosylation in animals [25]. Based on these similarities, Gnt1 is predicted to catalyze addition of αGlcNAc to HyPro. In support of these assignments, a synthetic peptide containing 4(trans)HyPro is a specific albeit weak substrate for Gnt1 [22], and independent mAbs raised against a GlcNAcα1,4(trans)HyPro containing Skp1 peptide recognize full-length Skp1 in crude extracts [26]. In addition, other than the Golgi homolog, there are no Gnt1-like sequences in the genome, and another known cytoplasmic αGlcNAcT, an α-toxin from Clostridium [27], is also not observed. Gnt1 is evolutionarily unrelated to the OGT enzyme that catalyzes formation of O-β-GlcNAc in many organisms [28].Gnt1 has predicted cytoplasmic homologs in a variety of other protists (Table 1). Each of these protist genomes also has a P4H1-like coding sequence and a Skp1-like sequence with the equivalent of Pro143, and therefore the P4H1- and Gnt1-like sequences may modify their Skp1s as in Dictyostelium. Interestingly, P4H1- and Gnt1-like sequences sometimes appear to encode separate domains of the same protein [17], as occurs for the other enzyme pairs in this pathway (see below). Biochemical complementation studies, in which purified recombinant P4H1 and Gnt1 are incubated with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc in extracts of P4H1-null mutants, suggest that the P4H1/Gnt1 couple is dedicated solely to the modification of Skp1 in Dictyostelium (H. van der Wel, C.M. West, unpublished data).PgtA was purified based on its fucosyltransferase activity and subsequently discovered to also possess a Skp1 galactosyltransferase activity. pgtA was cloned from amino acid sequence data obtained from the multi-million fold purified protein, and found to be required in cells for extension of the glycan chain beyond the first sugar GlcNAc. Cells are viable in its absence with only mild effects on proliferation [29]. PgtA is a soluble protein with separate domains mediating the different GT activities. Action of the β3GalT activity, which is associated with the N-terminal domain, is followed by the α2FucT activity of the C-terminal domain [29, 30]. Formation of the Gal β1,3GlcNAc-linkage was established based on its sensitivity to β3-galactosidase. The N-terminal β3GalT domain modifies Gn-O-Skp1 in vitro [30] and in vivo [26], indicating it possesses all determinants required for its enzymatic function. Both native and synthetic Skp1 GlcNAc-glycopeptide are both exceedingly poor acceptor substrates and poor inhibitors of the β3GalT activity, and the acceptor activity of full-length Skp1 is strongly inhibited by alkylation of its Cys-residues with iodoacetamide [26]. These data indicate that Skp1 recognition depends on determinants distinct from the sugar modification site, implying sites of secondary interaction which might help differentiate Skp1 from other potential GlcNAc-modified cytoplasmic proteins. The α2FucT activity was established based on product characterization of model substrates and α2-fucosidase sensitivity [31]. The isolated C-terminal domain exhibits α2FucT activity toward disaccharide acceptors in vitro, but only marginal activity toward full length GGn-O-Skp1 [29]. However, the full-length enzyme whose β3GalT activity is mutationally inactivated has full activity toward GGn-O-Skp1. In the presence of both UDP-Gal and GDP-Fuc, the addition of Fuc is nearly as efficient as that of Gal [30], indicating that the enzyme can function processively. Unlike the β3GalT activity, the α2FucT activity of PgtA toward GGn-O-Skp1 is not affected by prior alkylation, indicating that determinants associated with the alkylated Cys residues are important for galactoslylation per se. In addition to catalysis, the N-terminal domain is proposed to recognize Skp1 features distinct from its GlcNAc and present Skp1 to the C-terminal domain for fucosylation. Interestingly, concentrations of UDP-Gal above 10 μM are inhibitory in both the single and coupled reactions [26], but the mechanism is not known.The N-terminal β3GalT domain is related to the large CAZy GT2 family of catalytic domains based on sequence similarities and effects of mutagenesis [30]. GT2 domains are nearly always associated with cytoplasmic proteins in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, though an exception that appears to reside in the Golgi lumen was recently described [32]. The C-terminal α2FucT domain was the defining member of CAZy family GT74, and homologs have since been detected in other bacterial and eukaryotic genomes as predicted soluble proteins (Table 1). The protein sequences show similarity over the entire 260 amino acids thought to comprise the catalytic region. Three almost perfectly conserved sequence motifs are suggested by the alignment shown in Fig. 3. Further studies are required to determine whether these motifs are specifically predictive of α2FucT activity. The GT74 sequence cannot be aligned with CAZy GT11 or GT37 α2FucT sequences, showing that formation of this linkage evolved independently. In eukaryotes, the GT74 sequence occurs in tandem with a β3GalT-like GT2 sequence [17], but the order is reversed outside of the mycetezoan group.α2FucT sequence motifs, from an alignment of PgtA(C-terminal domain)-like sequences from CAZy family GT74. Each eukaryotic and prokaryotic example is a predicted cytoplasmic protein based on the absence of apparent N-terminal signal sequences. Amino acid names are colored according to their chemical class (hydrophobic, small, positive charge, negative charge or amide/hydrophilic/other). Based on the assumption that all three amoebazoan sequences have the same α2FucT function, positions occupied by amino acids of the same chemical class are highlighted in color according a different color scheme (hydrophobic, small/hydrophilic/Pro, positive charge, negative charge/amide). Positions conserving this quality in other sequences are highlighted similarly. Three conserved sequence motifs predicted to be associated with α2FucT activity are indicated (M1–M3). Positions of amino acid identity in all eukaryotic sequences are bolded. Sequence origins are listed at the bottom.Skp1 is the only acceptor substrate detected in biochemical reconstitution experiments in which PgtA and UDP-[3H]Gal are added back to cytosolic, microsomal, or nuclear extracts from pgtA− cells [26]. Similarly, Skp1 was the only protein labeled when GDP-[3H]Fuc was added back to an extract of gmd− mutant cells, which are unable to form GDP-Fuc from GDP-Man [7, 21]. In addition, metabolic labeling of cells with [3H]Fuc identifies predominantly Skp1 in the cytosolic fraction [7], and Skp1 is the only protein recognized in pgtA− cells by any of the mAbs that recognize the GlcNAc-O-Skp1 [26]. These findings suggest that Skp1 is the major if not exclusive acceptor substrate for PgtA in cells, which is consistent with the recognition requirements of PgtA for Skp1 discussed above.AgtA was originally purified as the enzyme that adds the fourth sugar αGal-1 [16]. The AgtA gene was cloned based on amino acid sequence data from the purified enzyme protein, and shown to be required, in vivo, for addition of both αGal-1 and the final sugar, αGal-2 [33]. Highly purified AgtA catalyzes the addition of two Gal residues to Skp1 in vitro (A. Ercan, C. Feasley, H. van der Wel, C.M. West, unpublished data), suggesting that AgtA may also mediate the addition of αGal-2 in vivo. The protein contains an N-terminal domain related to a sequence family that at the time had been predicted to have glycosyltransferase activity based on sequence/structure homology studies [34]. Purified AgtA modified synthetic Fucα-Bn with a single Gal residue, forming Galα1,3Fucα-Bn based on product characgterization [16], making AgtA the founding member of the CAZy GT77 family. A large family of related sequences are expressed in the Golgi of plants, green algae and brown algae [35], and an example from Arabidopsis (AtRGXT1) has been shown to catalyze formation of a Xylα1,3Fuc linkage in the pectin rhamnogalacturonan-II.BLAST searches reveal sequences similar to the GT77 catalytic domain in predicted cytoplasmic proteins of the distantly related D. purpureum [36], the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, and viridiplantae, including Arabidopsis, bryophytes, and chlorophytes (Fig. 4). An alignment of the inferred catalytic domains of these sequences and of AtRGXT1 shows similarities, especially in hydrophobic resides that probably contribute to the folded core, throughout the length of the catalytic domain (Fig. 4). Four highly conserved sequence motifs are potentially indicative of an α3-linkage for the sugar transferred from a UDP-precursor, though the type of sugar transferred cannot be inferred.αGalT sequence motifs. Alignment of Dictyostelium AgtA with related sequences from proteins of CAZy family GT77, predicted to be expressed in the cytoplasm based on absence of N-terminal targeting motifs. In addition, a known α3XylT (AtRGXT1) expressed in the Golgi of Arabidopsis is included on the bottom row for comparison. Four conserved sequence motifs from the predicted catalytic domains, including AtRGXT1, are indicated (M1–M4). Additional motifs not highlighted distinguish the amoebazoan sequences from the others. There are currently no motifs detected that differentiate predicted cytoplasmic viridiplantae sequences from predicted Golgi-associated sequences, and therefore the assignments as cytoplasmic should be considered provisional. Only the amoebazoan sequences (top 3 rows) are associated with WD-40 repeats predicted to fold into a 7-bladed -propeller. See Fig. 3 for color-coding information. Sequence origins are listed at the bottom.Dictyostelium AgtA possesses a second, C-terminal domain, consisting of 7 WD-40 repeats. These repeats probably fold into a β-propeller structure, which often mediates simultaneous, reversible, protein-protein interactions [37]. This domain is not required to galactosylate Fuc -Bn in vitro [16], or when truncated AgtA is overexpressed in vivo [26]. The -propeller-like domain is present in the AgtA homologs of other amoebazoans, suggesting that they are true orthologs (Table 1). Since the cytoplasmic agtA-like sequences of viridiplantae lack the β-propeller-like domain, and their genomes lack pgtA-like sequences, the predicted enzymes are unlikely to modify Skp1 in the same way.Skp1 was the only acceptor substrate for AgtA detected in a biochemical reconstitution assay in which a cytosolic extract of stationary phase cells was incubated with purified AgtA and UDP-[3H]Gal and incorporation analyzed by SDS-PAGE [33]. This is consistent with similar findings regarding the specificity of PgtA, which modifies Skp1 to form the substrate trisaccharide for AgtA (see above).Current evidence suggests that α-galactosylation of Skp1 may be conditionally regulated in the cell. Paradoxically, the native trisaccharide acceptor linked to a small aglycon is a much poorer substrate than the non-reducing terminal disaccharide, due mainly to a Vmax disadvantage [16]. The hairpin conformation adopted by the free trisaccharide (see above) may sterically interfere with enzyme processing. Acceptor activity of natural trisaccharide-Skp1 (FGGn-O-Skp1) is dramatically reduced upon denaturation with urea or heat [16], suggesting conformational control of the reaction by the Skp1 polypeptide that may involve trisaccharide presentation. Folding may also be important in vivo, because an expressed mutant Skp1-myc mutant accumulates glycoforms lacking one or both αGals [14]. Interestingly and in contrast to the other Skp1 GTs, AgtA is an abundant protein similar in amount to Skp1 itself, and copurifies with Skp1 during initial purification. The β-propeller domain of Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain kinase (MhkA) has been implicated in targeting of myosin for phosphorylation [38]. The fusion of a β-propeller domain to the AgtA catalytic domain may serve a similar function, by facilitating proper presentation of the acceptor trisaccharide to the AgtA active site, or recognizing the distal Skp1 determinants inferred from the effects of denaturation treatments.Skp1 modification must be post-translational since Pro143 is within 20 amino acids of the C-terminus. All four known HyPro modification pathway enzyme proteins are cytosolic after gentle cell lysis, consistent with the absence of detectable targeting sequences for organelles or the nucleus [17]. Although cell fractionation studies indicate the absence of the enzymes in vesicles where most GTs are located, an association with nuclei that is unstable to cell lysis has not been excluded. The enzymes are separable by anion exchange fractionation of the cytosolic fraction, and each of the single reactions is reasonably robust in vitro, before and after purification. Therefore, modification of Skp1 appears to involve sequential enzyme-substrate recognition events rather than processing in a multi-protein complex. The pathway thus resembles conventional O-glycosylation pathways in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, except that the enzymes are not membrane associated and spatially distributed along the pathway coordinate.The Skp1 modification enzymes may act in pairwise couples. The β3GalT and α2FucT activities are physically associated in PgtA, and the first enzyme (β3GalT) acts like a gatekeeper to the follow-up action of the α2FucT as described above. Since P4H1 and Gnt1 are apparently linked in a similar way in other organisms (Table 1), the first two steps may have retained a similar relationship as separate proteins. In view of the possibility that AgtA mediates attachment of both α-linked Gal residues, addition of the final sugars may follow the same paradigm following the conditional addition of αGal-1. While the significance of the proposed enzyme couples is unclear, it is noted that the follow-up step 2 is likely subject to different kinds of constraints as described above for PgtA, and would have the effect of rendering the initial step 1 irreversible.Current evidence suggests that Skp1 may be the only modification target of the HyPro modification pathway. As summarized above, reconstitution of extracts of mutant cells with a recombinant version of the deleted enzyme yields only Skp1 as the radiolabeled product. In general, the enzymes exhibit high affinity, μM-Km values toward the Skp1 substrates and to most of the donor substrates. A caveat is in the case of P4H1 whose reaction product was detected in a coupled reaction with Gnt1, so potential substrates not recognized by Gnt1 would have been missed. In addition, each enzyme shows dependence on polypeptide determinants of Skp1 separate from the the region surrounding Pro143 in in vitro reactions, suggesting the enzymes are restricted to substrates that share these features. When Skp1 is expressed in vivo, tags at the N-terminus or point mutations in its N-terminal domain interfere with efficient modification by P4H1, Gnt1, and AgtA. It is not known if incomplete modification is a direct effect on enzyme recognition, or consequences of effects on entry into SCF- or other complexes.The HyPro modification pathway of Dictyostelium offers a precedent for potential, yet-to-be-discovered complex glycosylation pathways in the cytoplasm. As reviewed recently [39, 40], there are numerous clues for their more widespread existence. The isolated occurrences in bacteria of potential homologs of individual HyPro-pathway GTs indicate these examples do not form the same pathway [41, 17]. Though most prokaryotic glycosyltransferases modify lipids and possibly proteins for export to the cell surface, several examples of potential cytoplasmic glycoproteins [42-44] hint at functions in intracellular regulation. In addition to the ubiquitous eukaryotic polypeptide βGlcNAcT (OGT) that modifies many cytoplasmic, nuclear, and possibly mitochondrial proteins with a single sugar [28], bacterial toxins and effectors modify eukaryotic host G-proteins and a GTPase elongation factor with αGlcNAc or αGlc [27]. Perhaps the best well-characterized complex O-glycosylation pathway other than the HyPro-pathway is encoded by PBCV-1, which modifies its own viral precursor capsid proteins in the cytoplasm of the Chlorella alga [45]. Evidence also exists for enzymes that can form a peptidoglycan-like structure in association with plastids in the cytoplasm of certain algae [46]. The enzymes that have been postulated or shown to be involved in these processes are so dissimilar to the Skp1 GTs that they almost certainly represent independent lines of evolution. Other less well documented predictions of cytoplasmic glycosylation [47, 41, 39] originally inspired initial interest on the Skp1 O-glycosylation pathway in Dictyostelium. Numerous plant and animal genomes that lack Skp1 modification GT genes harbor other GT-like sequences predicted to be expressed as cytoplasmic proteins, though their compartmentalization remains to be confirmed [41] (Fig. 4). Since each of the Skp1 GTs were discovered using traditional biochemical purification approaches, and their domains (except for the β3GalT) were each the first in its CAZy sequence family [24] to be described, it is likely that many cytoplasmic GTs remain to be discovered. In support of this idea, accumulating evidence for proteins with carbohydrate-binding activity in the nucleus and cytoplasm [48] suggests that novel functions for glycosylation in these compartments are likely to be discovered.Dictyostelium is an obligate aerobe, depending on at least 2.5% O2 to proliferate and aggregate in response to starvation. However, subsequent development is delayed at this level of O2, and execution of the slug-to-fruit switch, the decision point for culmination, does not occur if the O2 level is <12% [49]. The critical time for higher O2 is at ~12 h of development, during formation of the tipped aggregate and elongation into a slug [5], and the critical duration of higher O2 is 1-3 h (Z.A. Wang, C.M. West, unpublished data). Consistent with a need for higher O2, cells must be exposed at an air-water interface (on an agar or filter surface) to progress to later phases of development. If developing cells are submerged as for mammalian cell culture, a hyperoxic atmosphere, which may overcome the diffusion barrier to O2-transport posed by water, is required to complete development [50].Though cell respiration rates decline during development [51], higher external O2 may still be required to drive diffusion into the interior of the cell aggregate. However, high O2 is only required for a short critical period and, in hypoxia, extensive slime trails were formed indicative of persistent slug migration. These and other (see below) observations suggest that O2 serves an instructional role in addition to driving oxidative metabolism. For example, as listed in Fig. 1, O2 influences cell polarity and motility, slug migration, and cell type proportioning in the slug.Slugs composed of cells lacking P4H1 require even higher levels of O2, 18–21% or greater, to culminate [5]. In contrast, overexpression of P4H1 under the control of developmental promoters in a wild-type background reduces the O2-requirement to 2.5–5%. These effects suggest that P4H1 itself mediates O2-regulation of culmination, and that an override pathway detectable in the absence of P4H1 requires yet higher O2. P4H1− cells just below their O2-threshold differentiate the normal pattern of prestalk and prespore cell differentiation markers, but not markers of later differentiation [5], just like wild-type slugs formed just below their O2-threshold.The exact O2 threshold for culmination of normal and mutant slugs can differ slightly between trials, which might be explained by variations in other factors that also influence culmination, including light and NH3 [5]. Near the O2 threshold, breakthrough often occurs in patches especially near the periphery of the filter, suggesting that an unknown positive feedback process also influences culmination.The failure of P4H1− slugs to culminate below the O2-threshold appears to be due to an inability to generate rather than respond to a culmination signal, based on the observation that the presence of a small percentage of wild-type cells is sufficient to allow culmination of P4H1− cells at the wild-type O2-level [5]. Interestingly, many of the normal cells in these chimeras migrate to the anterior end of the slug, based on analysis of RFP-labeled strains, and differentiate into prestalk cells. Similarly, cells overexpressing P4H1 migrate to the tip in mixtures with wild-type cells. Tip cells are considered to be an important signaling center for initiating culmination [56, 57] (Fig. 1). Complementation of P4H1-null cells by expression of P4H1 under a prestalk cell (tip) promoter also rescues culmination. Expression under a prespore promoter rescues too, though the complemented strain also sorts to the anterior end in chimeras with P4H1-null cells. Finally, P4H1 more effectively reduces the O2-threshold when expressed in prestalk compared to prespore cells, though notably this effect requires expression in the wild-type background. These findings are consistent with a model in which P4H1 signals culmination from the anterior tip, where the full response may require activity in prespore cells as well.Dictyostelium P4H1 has a high Km for O2 that is well above the ambient level [11]. This suggests that P4H1 activity may be rate-limited by O2 as described in animals, but this has not been demonstrated directly. P4H1 appears to be expressed evenly in prestalk and prespore cells based on P4H1 promoter::RFP expression studies and Western blotting [5], indicating that different cell types or the tip are not predisposed to respond to O2. Based on the sorting behavior of cells expressing higher levels of P4H1 (see above), cells exposed to higher O2 may migrate to the tip and generate a culmination signal. Owing to the narrower diameter of the anterior region of the slug (see Fig. 1), resulting in a higher surface:volume ratio conducive to higher O2 penetration, prestalk cells might naturally exhibit greater O2-signaling. Interestingly, slug surface cells also have a propensity to become prestalk cells [50, 58]. Although the biological significance of these processes is currently not known, they might underlie a hypersensitivity that allows the entire slug to respond to changes in ambient O2 sensed by any cell as a sentinel. In the native soil environment, this system may help the slug to determine that it has translocated from a subterranean or submerged location where O2 is limiting to an above-ground, normoxic position where fruiting body formation would be optimal for spore dispersal. It is interesting that an O2 gradient may guide slugs to the soil surface [3], but it is not known if P4H1 is required for this response as well.The significance of HyPro-dependent glycosylation for O2-signaling has been investigated in the Skp1 glycosylation mutant strains. pgtA− cells, which accumulate Gn-O-Skp1, exhibit the wild-type (12%) requirement for O2, initially suggesting that glycosylation beyond the first sugar is dispensable [5]. The separate contributions P4H1 and Gnt1 have not yet been analyzed because gnt1 has resisted disruption (C.M. West et al., unpublished data). Surprisingly, subsequent studies showed that agtA− cells, which accumulate FGGn-O-Skp1, require ~16–18% O2 to culminate, almost as high as required by P4H1-null cells [26]. Thus PgtA has a function not revealed by the pgtA-knockout experiment. Mutants that assemble only 2 sugars, due either to expression of the N-terminal domain of PgtA in a pgtA− background or a mutation in gmd required to form GDP-Fuc, have an intermediate O2-dependence between that of pgtA- and agtA-knockout cells. Therefore, whereas PgtA negates the action of P4H1/Gnt1, AgtA negates the action of PgtA, restoring the initial effect of P4H1/Gnt1. This suggests the existence of multiple signals that control development, contingent upon sufficient O2 and other factors to initiate the pathway.Since Skp1 is the only detectable substrate of PgtA-β3GalT or -α2FucT in extracts, the reversal of the P4H1− phenotype by the action of PgtA provides genetic evidence that Skp1 is the functional substrate of P4H1-dependent signaling in cells. This is consistent with unpublished data (Z.A. Wang, C.M. West) that the O2-threshold for culmination is proportional to Skp1 levels in genetically manipulated cells. Though the majority of steady-state Skp1 appears to be modified throughout the life cycle, nascent Skp1-myc, induced under developmental control of a prespore cell promoter, is very inefficiently hydroxylated [14], suggesting that modification of newly synthesized Skp1 may be rate limiting at the time of O2-sensing. In addition, proteins that potentially interact with Skp1 in SCF complexes, including CulA, CulB, and FbxA, are required for normal development [12, 60–62], though effects on the O2-threshold remain to be investigated. Future work is needed to determine whether these proteins interfere with or promote Skp1 modifications, and if O2 signals via the SCF complex(es) to regulate culmination.The findings suggest the signaling model shown in Fig. 5. Skp1 is predicted to exert a negative effect, via E3(SCF)Ub-ligase-mediated polyubiquitylation and degradation of a hypothetical activator of culmination, based on increased signaling (reduced O2-requirement) when Skp1 is decreased. Protein kinase A (PKA) acts downstream of Skp1 modification based on suppressive effects of its overexpression on the P4H1-null phenotype [5]. P4H1 is interpreted to exert a negative effect on Skp1 based on the positive effect of O2 on the overall pathway. P4H1 and Gnt1 are grouped together as their separate roles are unknown. PgtA reverses this effect, and AgtA corrects the reversal, thereby enabling the wild-type level of inhibition of Skp1 that normally activates the pathway. How the glycosylation reactions are regulated is not known, but it is noted that the synthesis of UDP-Gal is developmentally up-regulated near culmination [59], and the PgtA-β3GalT and AgtA-α3GalT activities show sharply contrasting dependence on UDP-Gal concentration in in vitro assays (see above). Hyperoxia overrides the P4H1-null effect indicative of another O2-dependent pathway, as depicted on the right.Signaling pathway model. A proposed scheme for O2-signaling via the Skp1 modification enzymes, Skp1 (as a subunit of E3(SCF)Ub-ligases), a hypothetical activator, and protein kinase A (PKA). See text for explanation. The dependent sequence of posttranslational modifications are shown vertically at the left, and the dependent sequence of developmental transitions is shown vertically on the right. Speculative aspects of the model, such as regulation of glycosyltransferases by Fuc and Gal (at the left), are denoted in pink. High O2 can override the pathway, as shown at the right.At the cellular level, we propose that even 2.5% O2 is sufficient to support modification of the majority of Skp1 in the steady state. This degree of modification dampens Skp1 and SCF activity to a level appropriate for SCF-regulated functions. During development, access to O2 is limited as a physical consequence of multicellularity, so that a higher level of O2 is required to modify nascent Skp1. Considering the high stability of the Skp1:F-box protein interaction [e.g., 63], we suggest that developmentally regulated F-box proteins which are translated during the critical period for high O2, and potentially regulate the activity of a hypothetical culmination activator, will be most affected by the posttranslational status of coordinately synthesized Skp1. The biochemical mechanisms of Skp1 inhibition depicted by the model remain to be determined, but may involve changes in SCF subunit assembly, SCF dimerization, SCF activity, SCF cellular compartmentalization, and/or F-box protein selection. Glycosylation was previously shown to enhance nuclear accumulation of Skp1 in Dictyostelium [14].Whereas down-regulation of PHDs leads to accumulation of HIFα in animals (see Fig. 6 below), knockout of P4H1 does not materially alter Skp1 levels in Dictyostelium [5]. Possibly, hydroxylated Skp1 is protected by GlcNAc capping, which might explain why it has not been possible to knock out gnt1. If homologs of subunits of the VBC-type Ub-ligase that target hydroxylated HIFα are present in Dictyostelium, they are highly diverged (C.M. West, unpublished studies). Modification may be regulated for selected subpopulations of Skp1, such as a nuclear pool, a prestalk/tip-associated pool, or nascently synthesized Skp1. Interestingly, the majority of Skp1-myc expressed in prespore cells is non-hydroxylated [14], suggesting that hydroxylation does not keep pace with Skp1 synthesis during development.As summarized above and in Table 1, sequences related to HyPro modification genes are selectively yet broadly distributed across diverse protist phyla including other amoebazoa, excavates, stramenopiles (heterokonts), green algae, and alveolates (Table 1). Qualifications for inclusion in Table 1 include presence of key motifs identified by comparison with sequences from other amoebazoa or proteins with known activity, and absence of an N-terminal signal peptide motif for targeting to the secretory pathway. Biochemical studies support the bioinformatics evidence for Gnt1 in T. gondii, as soluble extracts from tachyzoites have a Skp1 GlcNAcT activity [64].All eukaryotic genomes with a homolog of Gnt1 also have a homolog of P4H1 and a Skp1 with the equivalent of Pro143 (Table 1). A subset, which thus far includes only examples from other amoebazoae, alveolates and stramenopiles, also possesses a potential homolog of PgtA. Currently, AgtA-like sequences are restricted to the amoebazoa. Though this suggests that the pathway is most highly specialized in Dictyostelium, it is equally likely that the core glycan is modified in different ways in the other organisms, potentially by GTs from new CAZy families yet to be discovered. Interestingly, the Phytophthora genomes each harbor a second Skp1 gene that lacks the Pro143 equivalent, suggesting the ability to bypass the regulatory pathway.Despite their apparent absence from animals and plants, the broad phylogenetic distribution of pathway genes in protists suggests existence of the glycosylation pathway in the ancestral eukaryotic lineage and deletion from organisms for which O2-sensing is not important or for which other O2-sensing mechanisms are more suitable. The pathway genes seem to be more likely found in unicellular organisms with life cycle stages exposed to varying degrees of hypoxia. Dictyostelium and Toxoplasma experience a range of normoxic and hypoxic environments, and sporulate or encyst in response to stress. In contrast, the pathway does not occur in another amoebazoan, Entamoeba, which lives anaerobically and may have no need for an O2-response pathway. In the apicomplexan lineage, pathway genes are found in Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum, related parasites that encounter normoxic, hypoxic and anoxic environments during their life cycles. In contrast, the genes are absent from related Plasmodium or Cryptosporidium species, which exist in well-oxygenated tissues where O2 levels vary less. The Skp1 O2-sensing pathway may not be suited for unicellular organisms that can function in anoxic conditions (e.g., fungi) or do not exist outside of an animal host (e.g., trypanosomatids). However, trypanosomatids do hydroxylate selected thymidine bases of DNA (base J), and cap these with β-D-Glc [65], a paradigm similar to Skp1 modification except for the targeting of DNA instead of protein. The responsible glucosyltransferase remains to be identified, and the potential relation of the modification to hypoxic regulation is unknown.O2-sensing pathway components known in other organisms do not occur in Dictyostelium and Toxoplasma. For example, in bacteria and selected unicellular eukaryotes, PAS domains associated with two-hybrid kinases bind O2 which activates kinase activity that transcriptionally induce various response genes [66, 67]. This class of PAS domains is not found in the Dictyostelium and Toxoplasma genomes. An O2-sensing pathway based on O2-dependent sterol biosynthesis, Sre1, and a PHD-like enzyme Ofd1 that may modify Sre1, is important in fission yeast [68], but the genes for this pathway are absent in Dictyostelium and Toxoplasma. Similarly, an O2-dependent heme biosynthetic pathway modulates Hap1 transcriptional factor/repressor activity in yeast [69], but Hap1 is not found in the Dictyostelium genome. The class of basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional factors that includes HIFα, the target of the animal ortholog of P4H1, is also absent. Rapid ‘bioenergetic’ responses to hypoxia, based on O2-dependent heme oxygenases, cytochrome P450s and NADPH-oxidases that modulate K+ and Ca++ channels [70], have evolved in vertebrates to control ventilation, but the potential significance of these pathways in unicellular organisms is unexplored.Skp1 is potentially the sole target of Dictyostelium P4H1 whereas the spectrum of targets of the three animal HIFα-type PHDs is probably broader. Since many plant and invertebrate Skp1s have the equivalent of Pro143 in a highly conserved sequence context, Skp1 might be a target of HIFα-type PHDs [71, 72] in these organisms even in the absence of a glycan cap as occurs in Dictyostelium. The absence of Pro143 in vertebrate Skp1s argues against this possibility unless an alternative Pro residue is targeted. Nevertheless, covalent regulation of Skp1 in unicellular organisms may have evolutionarily fixed Skp1 as a discrete adaptor protein in SCF Ub-ligases.The comparison of animal O2-signaling via the PHD- HIFα-VBC module with Dictyostelium O2-signaling via the P4H1-Skp1-SCF module suggests an evolutionarily ancient role for protein turnover in O2-regulation. The PHDs are apparent orthologs, and the SCF-type and VBC-type Ub-ligases are evolutionarily related with Skp1 of the SCF-complex being conserved with elongin C of the VBC-complex [8] though, notably, elongin C lacks the C-terminal domain of Skp1 that contains Pro143. By modifying the Ub-ligase itself, instead of a target of the Ub-ligase as in animals (depicted in Fig. 6A), Dictyostelium P4H1 may directly control the targets of all the E3(SCF)Ub-ligases, which may number up to 50 based on the number of F-box proteins predicted in the Dictyostelium genome (C.M. West, H. van der Wel, unpublished data). Therefore prolyl hydroxylation may directly regulate a broader subset of the proteome via polyubiquitination and degradation (Fig. 6B). The proposed Dictyostelium-type mechanism may represent a more primitive paradigm, which became focused on a specific transcriptional factor in animals. Hierarchical regulation by subsequent glycosylation suggests new druggable targets involved in developmental transitions of Toxoplasma and other parasites but not their host cells.Work described from the authors’ laboratory was supported by NIH grants R01-GM-37539 and R01-GM-83483.Publisher's Disclaimer: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

PMC2876446,Comparative Transcriptome and Secretome Analysis of Wood Decay Fungi Postia placenta and Phanerochaete chrysosporium▿ † ,False,"Cellulose degradation by brown rot fungi, such as Postia placenta, is poorly understood relative to the phylogenetically related white rot basidiomycete, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. To elucidate the number, structure, and regulation of genes involved in lignocellulosic cell wall attack, secretome and transcriptome analyses were performed on both wood decay fungi cultured for 5 days in media containing ball-milled aspen or glucose as the sole carbon source. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a total of 67 and 79 proteins were identified in the extracellular fluids of P. placenta and P. chrysosporium cultures, respectively. Viewed together with transcript profiles, P. chrysosporium employs an array of extracellular glycosyl hydrolases to simultaneously attack cellulose and hemicelluloses. In contrast, under these same conditions, P. placenta secretes an array of hemicellulases but few potential cellulases. The two species display distinct expression patterns for oxidoreductase-encoding genes. In P. placenta, these patterns are consistent with an extracellular Fenton system and include the upregulation of genes involved in iron acquisition, in the synthesis of low-molecular-weight quinones, and possibly in redox cycling reactions.Wood decay basidiomycetes, often categorized as white rot or brown rot fungi, are common inhabitants of forest litter, where they play a key role in carbon cycling (15). White rot fungi degrade all components of plant cell walls, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Although unable to grow on lignin alone, these filamentous fungi have the unique ability to degrade a large proportion completely to CO2 and H2O. White rot fungi, such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium, also employ an array of extracellular hydrolases that attack cellulose and hemicellulose while simultaneously depolymerizing the lignin by oxidative mechanisms (33). Brown rot fungi, exemplified by Postia placenta, employ a different approach. Early in the decay process, they rapidly depolymerize cellulose but without concomitant weight loss. As decay progresses, brown rot fungi modify lignin extensively, but the products remain in situ as a polymeric residue (40, 59). Brown rot fungi are of considerable economic importance as the principal agents causing the destructive decay of wooden structures.Although gross patterns of lignocellulose degradation differ substantially, the two decay types probably share at least some mechanisms, because molecular phylogeny, morphology, mating systems, and substrate preferences suggest that brown rot fungi have repeatedly evolved from white rot fungi (21). P. placenta and P. chrysosporium are members of the Phlebia clade, which lies within the order Polyporales (5, 20). Recent comparison of their genomes (36) indicated that the derivation of brown rot fungi is characterized largely by the contraction or loss of multiple gene families that are thought to be important in typical white rot, such as cellulases, lignin peroxidases (LiPs), manganese peroxidases (MnPs), copper radical oxidases (CROs), cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), and pyranose-2-oxidase (POX). This general pattern of simplification is consistent with the view that brown rot fungi have acquired novel mechanisms for cellulose depolymerization and lost key components of the white rot lignocellulose-degrading system (57).Previous microarray studies provided quantitative transcript profiles for P. chrysosporium (52) grown in defined medium containing either glucose or microcrystalline cellulose as sole carbon source. The transcriptome of P. chrysosporium has also been partially characterized by expressed sequence tag (cDNA) microarrays (28), serial analysis of gene expression (38), and most recently by deep pyrosequencing of cDNAs derived from oak-grown cultures (43). These transcriptome investigations have been complemented by mass spectrometry identification of P. chrysosporium proteins in defined (45, 53), semidefined (54), and complex (1, 41, 44) media. Considered together with numerous reports characterizing P. chrysosporium glycoside hydrolases (GHs) (reviewed in reference 2), there remains little doubt that hemicellulose and cellulose degradation involve the concerted action of conventional hydrolytic enzymes.In contrast, relatively little is known about the mechanism(s) of cellulose degradation by P. placenta or by brown rot fungi in general (reviewed in reference 2). Analysis of the P. placenta genome revealed a repertoire of genes distinct from those of all known cellulose-degrading microbes (36). The genome completely lacks cellulose-binding domains, and the number of glycosyl hydrolases is relatively low, owing in part to the paucity of cellulases. No exocellobiohydrolases and only two potential β-1,4-endoglucanase genes were identified. One putative endoglucanase (Ppl115648) was shown to be expressed at high levels in medium containing microcrystalline cellulose, relative to levels in glucose-grown mycelia, but it seems unlikely that this endoglucanase alone can account for the efficient cellulose depolymerization by P. placenta. Other GHs and/or hypothetical proteins may therefore be necessary for the complete breakdown of cellulose, and a central goal of our investigations was to identify potentially important enzymes by examining transcriptome and secretome patterns in cultures containing ground aspen as the sole carbon source.Many investigations of the mechanisms employed by white rot and brown rot fungi have suggested the participation of low-molecular-weight oxidants. A hydroxyl radical, generated via the Fenton reaction (H2O2 + Fe2+ + H+ → H2O + Fe3+ + OH), has been strongly implicated as a diffusible oxidant in brown rot (recent papers on this topic include references 10, 36, and 58) and, to a lesser extent, in white rot (2). To identify specific enzymes and provide insight into mechanisms of lignocellulose degradation, we report here the systematic comparisons of transcriptomes and secretomes of P. placenta and P. chrysosporium when cultivated on a lignocellulosic substrate.RNA for microarrays was obtained from P. chrysosporium strain RP78 and P. placenta strain MAD-698-R (Forest Mycology Center, Forest Products Laboratory, USDA Forest Service) grown in Highley's basal salt medium (23) containing either 0.5% (wt/vol) ball-milled aspen (BMA) or glucose as sole carbon source. Highley's basal medium contains per liter 2 g NH4NO3, 2 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g CaCl2·2H2O, 1 mg thiamine, and 10 ml of a mineral solution [per liter, 1.5 g nitrilotriacetic acid, 3 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g MnSO4·H2O, 1 g NaCl, 0.1 g FeSO4·H2O, 0.1 g CoSO4, 0.1 g CaCl2, 0.1 g ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g CuSO4, 0.01 g AlK(SO4)2·12H2O, 0.01 g H3BO3, and 0.01 g NaMoO4·2H2O]. Aliquots of 250 ml of medium in 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks were inoculated with approximately 107 P. chrysosporium spores or with P. placenta mycelia scraped from the surface of potato dextrose agar. Unless otherwise specified, cultures of P. chrysosporium and P. placenta were harvested after 5 days on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 37°C or room temperature, respectively.Culture supernatants from all media were tested for lignin peroxidase (50), manganese peroxidase (56), glyoxal oxidase (31, 32), and cellobiose dehydrogenase (3) enzyme activities. P. placenta has none of the corresponding genes and, as expected, no activities were detected. In the case of P. chrysosporium, these 5-day cultures are too early for significant lignin degradation, and no peroxidase or glyoxal oxidase activity was observed. The BMA-grown P. chrysosporium cultures also had no detectable cellobiose dehydrogenase activity. Oxalate concentrations (25) were low (<50 μM) in BMA culture filtrates of both species.From a data set of 10,004 unique P. chrysosporium gene predictions, each Roche NimbleGen array (Madison, WI) featured 12 unique 60-mer probes per gene, all in triplicate. (Seven gene models composed mostly of repetitive DNA were represented by only 2 to 11 60-mers.) The P. placenta arrays were based on 12,438 gene models, with 10 unique 60-mers per allele, again all in triplicate. Complete design details for P. chrysosporium and P. placenta Roche NimbleGen arrays are available under platforms {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GPL8022"",""term_id"":""8022""}}GPL8022 and {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GPL7187"",""term_id"":""7187""}}GPL7187, respectively, within the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/index.cgi).For each of the four combinations of species and medium (BMA-P. placenta, BMA-P. chrysosporium, glucose-P. placenta, and glucose-P. chrysosporium), total RNA was purified from triplicate cultures. In short, cultures were harvested by filtering through Miracloth (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, Gibbstown, NJ), squeeze dried, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were stored at −80°C until use. Extraction buffer was prepared by combining 10 ml of 690 mM sodium para-aminosalicylate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with 10 ml of 56 mM sodium tri-isopropyl naphthalene sulfonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and placed on ice. To this was added 5 ml of 5× RNB (1.0 M Tris, 1.25 M NaCl, 0.25 M EGTA). The pH of the 5× RNB was adjusted to 8.5 with NaOH. The mixture was kept on ice and shaken just before use.Frozen fungal pellets were ground to a fine powder with liquid nitrogen in an acid-washed, prechilled mortar and pestle. The ground mycelia were transferred to Falcon 2059 tubes (VWR International, West Chester, PA), and extraction buffer was added to make a thick slurry. The samples were vortexed vigorously and placed on ice until all samples were processed. A one-half volume of Tris-EDTA (TE)-saturated phenol (Sigma-Aldrich) and a volume of chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to each sample and samples were again vortexed vigorously. Samples were spun at 2,940 × g in a fixed-angle rotor for 5 min. The aqueous layer was removed to a new tube, and phenol-chloroform extractions were repeated until the interface between the aqueous and organic layers was clear. The final aqueous extractions were placed in clean 2059 tubes, to which was added a 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2 (diethyl pyrocarbonate treated), and 2 volumes of absolute ethanol. The tubes were shaken vigorously and stored overnight at −20°C.The tubes were spun for 1 h at 2,940 × g, the supernatants were decanted, and the pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of RNase-free H2O. Total RNA was purified using the RNeasy Maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAs were eluted from the RNeasy spin columns using two spins, for a final volume of 2 ml. The eluted RNAs were ethanol precipitated and stored overnight at −20°C. The RNAs were spun for 1 h at 2,940 × g, washed once with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 50 to 100 μl of RNase-free H2O. Three biological replicates per medium were used (12 separate arrays).RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA and labeled with the Cy3 fluorophore. In brief, 10 μg of total RNA was incubated with 1× first-strand buffer, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), 100 pM oligo T7 d(T)24 primer, and 400 U of SuperScript II (Invitrogen) for 60 min at 42°C. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized by incubation with 1× second-strand buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.07 U/μl DNA ligase (Invitrogen), 0.27 U/μl DNA polymerase I (Invitrogen), 0.013 U/μl RNase H (Invitrogen), at 16°C for 2 h. Immediately following this incubation, 10 U of T4 DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was added for an additional 5-min incubation at 16°C. Double-stranded cDNA was treated with 27 ng/μl of RNase A (EpiCenter Technologies) for 10 min at 37°C. Treated cDNA was purified using an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (Ambion), ethanol precipitated, washed with 80% ethanol, and resuspended in 20 μl of water. One microgram of each cDNA sample was amplified and labeled with 1 unit per μl of Klenow fragment (New England BioLabs) and 1 optical density unit of Cy3 fluorophore (TriLink Biotechnologies, Inc.) for 2 h at 37°C. Array hybridization was carried out by Roche NimbleGen (Iceland) using 6 μg of labeled cDNA suspended in NimbleGen hybridization solution for 17 h at 42°C. Arrays were scanned on the Axon 4000B scanner (Molecular Dynamics), and data were extracted from the scanned image using NimbleScan v2.4. The DNASTAR ArrayStar v2.1 software (Madison,WI) was used to quantify and visualize data. Analyses were based on three biological replicates per culture medium. Quantile normalization and robust multiarray averaging (RMA) (26) were applied to the entire data set. Scatter plots of results are shown in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material. Unless otherwise specified, expression levels are based on log2 values, and significant differences in expression were determined using the moderated t test (48) with the false discovery rate (4) threshold set at P < 0.001. Newly acquired data can be viewed/downloaded together with previously described microarray results (36, 52) under NCBI GEO design platforms {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GPL8022"",""term_id"":""8022""}}GPL8022 and {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GPL7187"",""term_id"":""7187""}}GPL7187 for P. chrysosporium and P. placenta, respectively.Competitive reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to quantify transcripts of P. placenta genes encoding three copper radical oxidases, two laccases, two glucose oxidases, and a secreted FAD-containing oxidoreductase. Gene-specific primers and amplicon information are listed in Table S3 of the supplemental material. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmation of P. chrysosporium microarrays was previously reported (52).Soluble extracellular protein was concentrated from culture filtrates as previously reported (53, 54). Following SDS-PAGE fractionation, in-gel digestion and mass spectrometric analysis were performed on an LC/MSD Trap SL spectrometer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) as described elsewhere (www.biotech.wisc.edu/ServicesResearch/MassSpec/ingel.htm). An in-house licensed Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom) identified peptides using the 10,048 and 17,173 gene models in the v2.1 P. chrysosporium (53) and in the P. placenta (36) data sets, respectively. Mascot scores of ≥40 were considered highly significant.A second approach eliminated SDS-PAGE fractionation and instead precipitated total protein from 200-ml culture filtrates by direct addition of solid trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to 10% (wt/vol). Following overnight storage at −20°C, the precipitate was centrifuged and the pellet washed several times with cold acetone. Pelleted proteins were resolubilized and denatured in 50 μl of 8 M urea-50 mM NH4HCO3 for 10 min and then diluted to 250 μl for tryptic digestion with 12.5 μl of 25 mM DTT, 12.5 μl acetonitrile (ACN), 155 μl Milli-Q water, and 20 μl trypsin solution (100 ng/μl Trypsin Gold [Promega Corp.] in 25 mM NH4HCO3). Digestion was conducted in two stages, first for 2 h at 42°C and then an additional 20 μl of trypsin solution was added and incubated overnight at 35°C. Reactions were terminated by acidification with 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a 0.4% final concentration. Peptides generated from digestion were analyzed by nano-LC-MS/MS using the Agilent (Palo Alto, CA) 1100 nanoflow system connected to a hybrid linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap; Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. Capillary high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed using an in-house-fabricated column with an integrated electrospray emitter essentially as previously described (35) but using 360-μm by 75-μm fused silica tubing. The column was packed with 5 μm of C18 particles (Column Engineering, Ontario, CA) to approximately 12 cm. Sample loading (8 μl) and desalting were achieved using a trapping column in line with the autosampler (Zorbax 300SB-C18; 5 μM; 5 by 0.3 mm; Agilent). HPLC solvents were as follows: loading solvent, 1% (vol/vol) ACN, 0.1 M acetic acid; solvent A, 0.1 M acetic acid in water; solvent B, 95% (vol/vol) acetonitrile, 0.1 M acetic acid in water. Sample loading and desalting were performed at 10 μl/min with the loading solvent delivered from an isocratic pump. Gradient elution was performed at 200 nL/min and by increasing the percentage of solvent B in solvent A from 0 to 40 in 200 min, 40 to 60 in 20 min, and 60 to 100 in 5 min. The LTQ-Orbitrap was set to acquire MS/MS spectra in data-dependent mode as follows: MS survey scans from m/z 300 to 2,000 were collected in profile mode at a resolving power of 100,000. MS/MS spectra were collected on the five most abundant signals in each survey scan. Dynamic exclusion was employed to increase dynamic range and maximize peptide identifications. This feature excluded precursors up to m/z 0.55 below and m/z 1.05 above previously selected precursors. Precursors remained on the exclusion list for 15 s. Single charged ions and ions for which the charge state could not be assigned were rejected from consideration for MS/MS. Using the above-mentioned protein databases, the MS/MS spectra were analyzed using the in-house Sequest search engine (version 27, revision 13; ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Sequest searches were done with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.50 Da, parent ion tolerance of 2.5 Da, and methionine oxidation as variable modification. Scaffold (version 2_05_02; Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Unless otherwise specified, protein identifications were accepted if they contained at least two identified peptides and if protein probabilities exceeded 95.0% as determined by the Protein Prophet algorithm (39).Throughout this report, protein similarity scores are based on the Smith-Waterman algorithm (47) using the BLOSUM62 matrix. P. chrysosporium and P. placenta protein model identification numbers are preceded by Pchr and Ppl, respectively. Detailed information for each protein can be directly accessed by appending the model number to the following strings: http://genome.jgi-psf.org/cgi-bin/dispGeneModel?db=Phchr1&id=X or http://genome.jgi-psf.org/cgi-bin/dispGeneModel?db=Pospl1&id=X, where X is the one- to five-digit model number for P. chrysosporium or P. placenta, respectively. (Alternatively, access can be obtained via search pages of the genome portals by entering protein ID numbers under Gene Models.) We assigned a function or a “putative” function only when supported by direct experimental evidence or when comparisons to known proteins revealed conserved catalytic features and/or significant alignment scores (bit scores of >150) to known proteins within the Swiss-Prot database. All other proteins were designated hypothetical, and those with significant amino acid similarity (bit scores of >150) to other conceptual translations within GenBank were considered conserved hypothetical proteins.All MIAME-compliant (7) microarray expression data have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO series accession numbers {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE14736"",""term_id"":""14736""}}GSE14736 and {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE12540"",""term_id"":""12540""}}GSE12540 for P. chrysosporium and P. placenta, respectively.Of the 12,438 P. placenta models represented on our microarrays (Table ​(Table1),1), 8,871 were BlastP matched to P. chrysosporium proteins with pairwise identities ranging from 28% to 100% (e-values of <10−5; scores of >79) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material for a complete listing of Smith-Waterman scores, e-values, and alignment parameters). Due to gene multiplicity and/or allelism within the P. placenta protein set, a single P. chrysosporium model was often the best “hit” for multiple P. placenta protein models. The total number of unique P. chrysosporium models matching the P. placenta data set was 5,538, approximately 55% of the total P. chrysosporium models.Gene expression summary for P. chrysosporium and P. placenta after 5 days of growth in medium containing ball-milled aspen as sole carbon sourceThe P. placenta expression microarrays identified numerous genes whose transcripts levels differed substantially between glucose- and BMA-containing media. Transcripts corresponding to 253 P. placenta gene models accumulated >2-fold in either BMA or glucose medium. Of these, 173 accumulated >2-fold in BMA relative to glucose and, in 145 cases, this upregulation in BMA was highly significant (P < 0.001). Transcripts of 80 P. placenta genes accumulated >2-fold in glucose medium, and 48 of these showed highly significant increases relative to BMA. The P. placenta microarrays include 12,438 targets (Table ​(Table1),1), a design based largely on an imperfect computational deletion of allelic variants (36). Careful manual inspection of the 253 regulated “genes” revealed the presence of both alleles for three of these genes. Taking these adjustments into account, 250 P. placenta genes were regulated >2-fold. Of the 250 genes, 190 were significantly regulated (P < 0.001), with 142 upregulated in BMA and 48 upregulated in glucose medium.The overall number of regulated P. chrysosporium genes, 296, was not dramatically different from the P. placenta microarray results. However, variance between the replicated P. chrysosporium cultures was slightly higher than P. placenta cultures, and consequently only 65 genes showed significance at our stringent threshold of P < 0.001. Of these, transcripts of 57 genes accumulated in BMA, while only 8 genes increased in the glucose medium. The P. chrysosporium v2 gene models are not complicated by allelism, although we could not distinguish between duplications or possible assembly errors for two of the BMA-upregulated genes (gly74b models Pchr134556 and Pchr28013 and cel7F/G models Pchr9702 and Pchr129072). Scatter plots graphically illustrate transcript levels of all genes (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), and complete microarray data are available under GEO accession numbers {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE14736"",""term_id"":""14736""}}GSE14736 (P. chrysosporium) and {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE12540"",""term_id"":""12540""}}GSE12540 (P. placenta).Transcript levels in BMA medium were roughly correlated among putative orthologs in the two species (correlation coefficient, 0.223; n = 8,799 matched pairs) but substantial variation in gene content, gene regulation, and gene expression levels were apparent. For example, of the above-mentioned 190 P. placenta genes regulated >2-fold (P < 0.001) in BMA, 19 had no apparent homologs in P. chrysosporium. Fourteen of these P. placenta-specific genes were upregulated in BMA medium, while transcripts of five accumulated in glucose medium. Focusing on the remaining 171 (190 minus 19) regulated P. placenta genes with orthologs in P. chrysosporium, only 30 (∼18%) showed a similar pattern of regulation in the two species, and 8 showed the opposite pattern. Among the latter were genes potentially involved in aromatic compound metabolism (phenylalanine ammonia lyase and aldehyde dehydrogenase) and in iron homeostasis (ferroxidase and iron permease). In P. placenta, these genes were upregulated in BMA medium, whereas the P. chrysosporium homologs were more highly expressed in glucose medium.High-scoring peptides corresponding to 67 P. placenta protein models and 79 P. chrysosporium models were detected by MS/MS analysis of extracellular filtrates from BMA cultures. The LTQ Orbitrap analysis of TCA-precipitated samples identified considerably more proteins relative to SDS-PAGE fractionation and analysis on the Agilent LC/MSD Trap SL spectrometer. Seventy-three P. chrysosporium proteins were identified by the former, while only 30 proteins were identified by the latter method. The results were even more pronounced for P. placenta, where the number of proteins increased from 19 to 63 using TCA precipitation and the Orbitrap instrument. It is likely that the increased number of identified proteins was due to instrument sensitivity, but sample preparation also may have played some role. The identity and complete data for all 146 proteins are presented in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material.P. chrysosporium and P. placenta exhibited distinct patterns of glycoside hydrolase expression. Among the 35 P. chrysosporium genes whose transcripts accumulated >4-fold (P < 0.001) in BMA, 22 could be assigned to a glycosyl hydrolase family (Fig. ​(Fig.1)1) (9; http://www.cazy.org/). Peptides corresponding to 12 of these were identified in culture filtrates. Exocellobiohydrolase CBHI (GH7 models Pchr137372 and Pchr137216) and exocellobiohydrolase CBHII (GH6 model 133052) were expressed at relatively high levels and substantially upregulated in BMA relative to glucose (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). The absence of CBH genes in P. placenta was previously noted (36). Similarly, P. placenta lacks homologs of significantly upregulated genes within the GH74 (Pchr134556, Pchr138266, and Pchr28013) and GH11 (Pchr133788) families. The latter gene likely encodes an endoxylanase, while the GH74 family is too functionally diverse to assign function.Heat map showing hierarchical clustering of Phanerochaete chrysosporium genes exhibiting highly significant (P < 0.001) accumulation of transcripts in aspen-grown versus glucose-grown cultures. Numbers within boxes indicate the fold difference in transcripts for aspen versus glucose cultures. Only those P. chrysosporium genes exceeding a 4-fold difference are shown. Underlined P. chrysosporium models correspond to genes with >50 cDNA tags in medium containing powdered oak (43). On the right, a heat map shows transcript levels of the most closely related P. placenta sequences or, in the absence of a clear homolog, labeled as “None.” Protein IDs followed by asterisks correspond to peptides unambiguously identified by LC-MS/MS in filtrates from aspen-grown cultures. The log2-based scales below maps are calibrated to the data shown above. Boldface denotes models in need of editing: GH10 xylanase model Ppl113670 has been superceded by an annotated preferred version, Ppl134783, which shows less pronounced upregulation (1.10) with a log2 signal of 11.3. GH27 α-galactosidase model Ppl128150 has been superceded by annotated preferred version Ppl13470, which shows more pronounced upregulation (3.08) with a log2 signal of 14.4 (Table ​(Table3;3; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material for detailed data).The P. chrysosporium genes corresponding to functionally characterized endoglucanases EG28 (Pchr8466; cel12A), EG44 (Pchr4361; cel5B), and EG38/36 (Pchr6458; cel5A) (19, 51) were also highly expressed and upregulated. High transcript levels and significant peptide scores were also observed for Pchr7048 (cel12B), a likely GH12 endoglucanase based on its similarity to cel12A. The putative P. placenta homologs to cel12A/B and cel5A, Ppl121191 and Ppl117690, respectively, were also highly expressed in BMA but did not exhibit significant transcript accumulation relative to glucose medium. As commonly observed for endoglucanases, Pchr4361 (cel5B) and Pchr6458 (cel5A) each contain a cellulose binding domain (carbohydrate binding module family 1 [CBM1]) and, as previously noted (36), such substrate binding modules are absent from the P. placenta genome.Transcripts of three putative P. chrysosporium GH61-encoding genes accumulated >4-fold in BMA, and corresponding peptides were identified for the dramatically upregulated cel61B gene (Pchr121193) (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). The P. chrysosporium genome contains at least 13 GH61 genes, whereas P. placenta has only 2 clear representatives of this family, Ppl135008 and Ppl126811 (36). The P. placenta genes are expressed at relatively low levels in BMA. Although often referred to as cellulases or even endoglucanases, the precise function(s) of GH61s is unclear (30).Excluding the GH11s, a xylanase family absent from the P. placenta genome, several genes broadly defined as hemicellulases or pectinases are similarly regulated in the two fungi. Thus, upregulated P. chrysosporium genes encoding putative α-galactosidase, polygalacturonase, rhamnogalactosidase, mannosidase, xylanase, and β-d-xylosidase are also recognizable in the P. placenta data set, and their transcripts accumulate to some extent in BMA medium (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). In contrast, the P. chrysosporium gene encoding a putative carbohydrate active esterase (CE1), Pchr126075, is likely involved in hemicellulose degradation, but no similar sequences were detected within the P. placenta genome. The putative P. chrysosporium glucuronyl esterase, Pchr6482, is highly conserved among various cellulolytic microbes (14). Members of a new family of esterases (CE15s), Pchr6482 and Pchr130517, may hydrolyze ester linkages between glucuronoxylans and lignin (13, 14). The corresponding P. placenta gene, Ppl95582, is expressed at relatively low levels and shows only a modest increase in transcript accumulation in BMA medium.The roles of several highly regulated P. chrysosporium genes are unknown, particularly those encoding hypothetical proteins. Of the hypothetical proteins listed in Fig. ​Fig.1,1, transcripts of three accumulated in glucose medium and another three accumulated in BMA medium. Of the latter, Pchr131440 features a 5′ CBM1 domain, suggesting a direct interaction with cellulose or hemicelluloses. Beyond these hypothetical proteins, we observed increased transcripts of genes encoding cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH; Pchr11098) and aldose-1-epimerase (Pchr138479) in BMA medium. As noted previously (54), the precise function of these enzymes is uncertain, but they may be physiologically connected through the generation of the β-anomer of cellobiose, the preferred substrate of CDH (22). Irrespective of the impressive transcript levels, neither CDH nor aldose epimerase was detected by mass spectrometry, and no CDH activity was measured in culture filtrates.With the exception of CDH and a putative acetoin dehydrogenase (Pchr138350), relatively few P. chrysosporium oxidoreductase genes were highly regulated under the conditions employed (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). Relaxing thresholds for transcript regulation (from 4- to 2-fold) and for the false detection rate (from P < 0.001 to P < 0.01) still only revealed 10 oxidoreductase genes upregulated in BMA medium (Table ​(Table2).2). Another four putative oxidoreductases were matched to MS/MS-derived peptide sequences (Table ​(Table2).2). Based on structure and well-established biochemistry (60), the FRE-like iron reductase (Pchr1139) and the cellulose binding cytochrome b562 (Pchr147) are likely involved in iron reduction. The latter gene has no homolog within P. placenta, and the former corresponds to a P. placenta gene with relatively low transcript levels in BMA medium (log2 signal of 10.2). Alcohol oxidase protein models Pchr126879 and Ppl118723 are highly conserved in P. chrysosporium and P. placenta, and these sequences are >87% identical to a methanol oxidase from the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum (12).P. chrysosporium genes encoding putative oxidoreductases upregulated >2-fold in BMA medium relative to glucose medium or matched to MS/MS-derived peptide sequencesaThe P. placenta genes whose transcripts accumulated >4-fold in glucose medium or in BMA medium (Fig. ​(Fig.2)2) differed markedly from the regulated P. chrysosporium genes (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). Only five glycoside hydrolase-encoding genes were substantially upregulated in BMA medium (Fig. ​(Fig.2),2), but others were expressed at high levels in both glucose and BMA media, and still others encoded detectable extracellular protein irrespective of relatively low transcript levels. A total of 36 P. placenta GH proteins were flagged on the basis of high transcript levels and/or MS/MS identification (Table ​(Table3).3). Of the eight GH-encoding genes exceeding the genome-wide signal average (log2, 10.9) by 2 standard deviations, none was upregulated >4-fold, and three were upregulated <2-fold in BMA medium (Table ​(Table3).3). In addition to high transcript levels, the likely importance of these genes was supported by LC-MS/MS identification of peptides in four cases (Table ​(Table3).3). Genes whose transcripts accumulated at significantly (P < 0.01) higher levels in glucose medium than in BMA medium included a GH47 mannosyl-oligosaccharide α-1,2-mannosidase (Ppl115593) and a GH20 chitooligosaccharidolytic β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Ppl130398), which are possibly involved in protein modification and cell wall morphogenesis, respectively (Table ​(Table33).Heat map showing hierarchical clustering of P. placenta genes exhibiting highly significant (P < 0.001) accumulation of transcripts in aspen-grown versus glucose-grown cultures. Numbers within boxes indicate the fold difference in transcripts in aspen versus glucose cultures. Only those P. placenta genes exceeding a 4-fold difference are shown. On right is a heat map showing transcript levels of the most closely related P. chrysosporium sequences or, in the absence of a clear homolog, labeled as “None.” Protein IDs followed by asterisks correspond to peptides unambiguously identified by MS in filtrates from aspen-grown cultures. Scales below maps show log2-based signals. Underlined P. chrysosporium models correspond to genes with >50 cDNA tags in medium containing powdered oak (43).P. placenta genes encoding putative GHs with the highest transcript levels and/or positive MS/MS identification in BMA mediumaThe overall pattern of P. placenta GH regulation (Fig. ​(Fig.11 and ​and2),2), transcript levels (Table ​(Table3;3; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material), and mass spectrometry-based protein identification (see Tables S1 and S2) highlight the importance of hemicellulose hydrolysis with relatively few potential cellulases. Broadly defined, these putative hemicellulases include endo-β-1,4-mannosidases, endo-1,3(4)-β-glucanase, glucan 1,3-β-glucosidase, α-galactosidases, β-galactosidase, glucan 1,3-β-glucosidase, α-arabinofuranosidases, endoxylanases, β-mannosidase, α-1,2-mannosidases, galactan 1,3-β-galactosidase, and β-xylosidase. As mentioned above, the P. placenta genome lacks genes encoding exocellobiohydrolases or genes containing the cellulose binding module CBM1. Protein models assigned to the GH5 family and predicted to contain endoglucanase catalytic domains include Ppl103677, Ppl117690, and Ppl115648, which gave microarray signals of 11.7, 13.7, and 15.0, respectively (see Table S1). All showed >60% sequence identity to the P. chrysosporium endoglucanase designated EG38/36 (Pchr6458) (19, 51). The high transcript levels and protein scores observed for Ppl115648 support an important function, but in the absence of binding modules and exocellobiohydrolases, it is unclear how efficient cellulose hydrolysis proceeds. Apparent P. placenta orthologs of the P. chrysosporium GH12 endoglucanase EG28 (19) are transcribed in BMA (Ppl52805, log2 of 9.23; Ppl121191, log2 of 13.74), but the corresponding proteins were not detected by MS/MS.Expression of P. placenta oxidoreductase genes differed sharply from P. chrysosporium genes. Transcripts of 23 genes accumulated >2-fold (P < 0.001) in BMA relative to glucose cultures, and peptides corresponding to four genes were detected in BMA filtrates (Table ​(Table4).4). With the exception of a polyphenol oxidase, Ppl114245, homologs were identified in all cases. However, only Ppl49605, a galacturonic acid reductase, and Ppl128830, a glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase (GMC oxidoreductase) distantly similar to glucose oxidase, were similarly regulated in the two fungi. Certain P. chrysosporium homologs were not regulated but still produced relatively high transcript levels in BMA medium. These included genes encoding a putative ferroxidase (Ppl109824), methanol oxidase (Ppl118723), and formate dehydrogenases (Ppl98518 and Ppl119730). Proteins corresponding to a copper radical oxidase (Ppl56703), an FAD-linked oxidoreductase (Ppl122772), and the above-mentioned GMC oxidoreductase (Ppl128830) were accompanied by relatively high transcript levels, but regulated expression levels that increased >2-fold were not observed. The Postia CRO protein is similar to three P. chrysosporium copper radical oxidases (CRO3, CRO4, and CRO5), with N-terminal repeats of a highly conserved WSC domain (55). None of the seven P. chrysosporium CRO proteins was detected by MS/MS in BMA cultures. Transcripts of the P. placenta cro genes, together with other putative oxidoreductases, were also detected by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. ​(Fig.33).Transcript levels of P. placenta genes encoding copper radical oxidases (Ppl130305, Ppl56703, and Ppl64380), GMC oxidoreductases with distant similarity to glucose oxidase (GOX; Ppl108489 and Ppl128830), an intact laccase (Ppl89382), a truncated laccase model (Ppl46931), and the highly expressed FAD-dependent oxidoreductase Ppl114192 (Table ​(Table4).4). Gray bars and the left axis represent log2 microarray signals. Blackened bars and the right axis represent cDNA as determined by competitive RT-PCR. Asterisks indicate protein models whose peptides were identified in concentrated filtrates of aspen-grown cultures.P. placenta genes encoding putative oxidoreductases upregulated >2-fold in BMA medium relative to glucose medium or matched to MS/MS-derived peptide sequencesaPrior to genome sequencing, morphological and molecular evidence suggested a close relationship between P. chrysosporium and P. placenta, irrespective of their distinctly different decay patterns (21, 57). The availability of the genomes (36, 37) and the broad proteome comparisons reported here largely underscore this close relationship. However, closer comparative transcriptome and secretome analyses illuminate complex and divergent physiological mechanisms employed in lignocellulose degradation by these model wood decay fungi.BlastP comparisons of P. chrysosporium proteins showed significant alignments for 71% of the 12,438 unique P. placenta models. These findings are sensitive to changes in the threshold e-value. For example, at an e-value of 10−10, 66% of the 12,438 P. placenta models were matched to at least one P. chrysosporium model. Our analysis involved identification of the best possible alignments using P. placenta protein sequences as a query to all P. chrysosporium targets, and this approach provides an overall measure of relatedness. The vast majority of best hit pairs are also the best reciprocal hits (6) as determined by additional BlastP analysis and manual inspections of all regulated genes, but the complete P. chrysosporium protein database was not queried against all P. placenta protein models. Draft genomes and automated annotations always contain assembly, model, and sequence errors. In addition, P. placenta allelism and the prevalence of P. chrysosporium extended gene families advise cautious assignment of orthologous pairs. For example, the most highly expressed and upregulated member of the GH5 family in P. placenta, Ppl115648, is most closely related to Pchr6458 (Table ​(Table3;3; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material), but it also shares sequence similarity (27% identity, 70% coverage, score of 202; e-value, 2.2 e−20) with Pchr4361. These P. chrysosporium genes encode well-characterized β-1,4-endoglucanase isozymes EG38/36 (Pchr6458) and EG44 (Pchr4361), both of which contain a cellulose binding domain (CBM1). In contrast, Ppl115648 does not possess a binding module, and its catalytic function has yet to be determined. Of course, proteins with similar sequences may have divergent functions, as is the case for Ppl46931 and its closest homolog, Pchr10581. Careful examination of these sequences revealed that Ppl46931 likely encodes a phenol oxidase (laccase), whereas laccases are absent from the P. chrysosporium genome, and Pchr10581 corresponds to MCO4 (34), a multicopper oxidase predicted to have ferroxidase-like activity (24, 34).After 5 days of growth in medium containing ball-milled aspen as the sole carbon source, the overall pattern of gene expression in P. chrysosporium and P. placenta cultures revealed an impressive array of extracellular glycoside hydrolases. MS/MS-identified proteins and corresponding transcript patterns clearly demonstrated expression of multiple extracellular endoglucanases and exocellobiohydrolases by P. chrysosporium. These observations strongly support a conventional system of synergistically acting enzymes. In contrast, hemicellulases dominated as the more highly expressed P. placenta genes under these same culture conditions. As degradation advances beyond 5 days, these expression patterns would likely shift. Systematic time course analyses by microarray and mass spectrometry, while costly, would illuminate such patterns.Our microarray-based transcript profiles for P. chrysosporium differ substantially from those of Sato et al. (43), who used deep RNA sequencing (cDNA pyrosequencing). Comparing their 293 genes, which gave rise to >15 RNA tags, to our microarray signals results in a low correlation coefficient, 0.13. Very different culture conditions were employed, e.g., water-extracted oak powder versus ball-milled aspen and 6-day stationary cultures versus 5-day shake flasks. Still, although the data of Sato et al. were not intended to identify and measure regulated expression, we note that of the 32 most highly upregulated genes in BMA (Fig. ​(Fig.1),1), 14 were also judged as highly expressed in oak culture, with each having >50 tags.To highlight comparisons of the cellulolytic systems, experiments were focused on short-term growth with ball-milled aspen as sole carbon source. This complex lignocellulose perhaps more closely mimics natural substrates relative to defined media containing glucose or pure microcrystalline cellulose (36, 45, 52, 53). However, submerging finely ground wood in basal salts hardly replicates the decay typically occurring in nature. Defined culture conditions allow straightforward harvesting of mycelia and extracellular enzymes, whereas in the present case the developing hyphae become intractably bound to the substrate. Simple measurements of biomass accumulation are difficult, and proteins may remain bound. In this connection, we observed modest upregulation of two lignin peroxidase genes (Table ​(Table2),2), but no enzyme activity or peptide sequences were detected for lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, or glyoxal oxidase in P. chrysosporium cultures. The absence of these activities and of MS-detectable peptides persists for at least 14 days (data not shown).Although these well-known components of the P. chrysosporium ligninolytic system were not detected in BMA cultures, high expression levels of methanol oxidase genes were observed in P. chrysosporium and P. placenta cultures (Table ​(Table4).4). In the brown rot fungus G. trabeum, this GMC oxidase is cell wall associated and thought to play an important role in peroxide generation (12). Although lignin metabolism differs substantially between white rot and brown rot fungi, lignin demethoxylation occurs in both types of decay. Methanol oxidation may be an important reaction generating peroxide and formaldehyde, and the observed high expression of formate dehydrogenases in both fungi may reflect the complete metabolism of methanol.Demethoxylation substrates may not be limited to lignin moieties, and some evidence suggests that substituted hydroquinones, known to be synthesized by several brown rot fungi, play a role in driving Fenton chemistry (11, 46). The biosynthesis of hydroquinones, such a 2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (2,5-DMHQ), has not been experimentally established but likely involves conversions of aromatic amino acids. In this connection, we observed significant upregulation (P < 0.001, >2-fold) of P. placenta genes encoding phenylalanine ammonium lyase (Ppl112824), 4-coumarate coenzyme A (CoA) ligase (Ppl43879), and an O-methyl transferase (Ppl47451) in BMA cultures, while the P. chrysosporium orthologs were downregulated or unchanged (4-coumarate-CoA ligase) under the same conditions (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Beyond biosynthesis of hydroquinones, we also observed upregulation of a potential quinate transporter, Ppl44553, although transcripts of the putative P. chrysosporium ortholog, Pchr138158, also accumulated in BMA medium.The mechanisms controlling extracellular Fenton reactions have been the subject of considerable debate (reviewed in references 2 and 17). Our P. placenta results support a hydroquinone-driven system and address the central question of quinone reduction. Specifically, we observed significant upregulation of 1,4-benzoquinone reductase (Ppl124517) in P. placenta BMA cultures, but not in P. chrysosporium cultures. Not only are benzoquinone reductase (Ppl124517) transcript levels significantly upregulated in Postia BMA cultures, but so too are those of a hydroquinol dioxygenase (Ppl 34850). Studies with Phanerochaete suggest roles for both a quinone reductase (8) and a hydroquinol dioxygenase (42) in aromatic metabolism of lignin fragments. Benzoquinone reductase in Postia may have dual roles, one in generating reactive oxygen species and a second role in aromatic metabolism in conjunction with hydroquinol dioxygenase. In addition, a tyrosinase-encoding gene (polyphenol oxidase, Ppl114245) and a laccase (Ppl46931), neither having a P. chrysosporium ortholog, were also significantly upregulated in BMA medium. The latter enzyme has been suggested to support a redox system via oxidation of hydroquinones (16, 18).Other P. placenta enzymes potentially involved in extracellular peroxide generation include a copper radical oxidase (Ppl56703), an FAD-linked oxidoreductase (Ppl122772), and a glucose oxidase-like protein (Ppl128830) (Table ​(Table4).4). Based on transcripts and mass spectrometry, secretion of these proteins is firmly established, but their precise activities, especially substrate preferences, remain to be determined.Further highlighting the physiological distinctions between P. chrysosporium and P. placenta are gene expression patterns related to iron homeostasis, crucial to a Fenton system. The importance of hydroquinone-driven Fenton chemistry in P. placenta remains unclear because, under certain culture conditions, this fungus secretes high levels of oxalate (29), and Fe3+-oxalate chelates are poorly reducible by hydroquinones (27). In our BMA medium, relatively low oxalate concentrations were detected (<50 μM) for both P. chrysosporium and P. placenta. Under these conditions, iron acquisition systems of the two species exhibited distinctly different expression patterns, with genes encoding ferroxidase and iron permease substantially upregulated in P. placenta and downregulated in P. chrysosporium (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2). Conversely, a membrane-anchored ferric reductase-like gene (Pchr1139) was highly expressed in P. chrysosporium, while the putative P. placenta ortholog (Ppl130043) was expressed at low levels (Table ​(Table2).2). Extracellular iron reductase activity in P. chrysosporium has been ascribed to low-molecular-weight glycopeptides GLP1 and GLP2 (49), but their log2 microarray signals are relatively low in BMA medium at 10.4 and 11.38, respectively. Four putative orthologs are present in the P. placenta genome, two of which gave high signals (Ppl128371, 12.57; Ppl128976, 14.72). Accordingly, a role for these glycoproteins in a P. placenta Fenton system is possible.Assessing the role(s) of hypothetical proteins remains problematic and especially challenging for P. placenta, which has a significantly higher number of “hypotheticals” expressed in BMA medium relative to P. chrysosporium. Several Postia hypotheticals (Ppl127853, Ppl126736, Ppl125910, Ppl130487, Ppl106710, and Ppl128867) have no apparent homologs in P. chrysosporium and, significantly, are highly upregulated in BMA medium (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2). In other cases (Ppl97454, Ppl12680, Ppl12147, and Ppl4379), putative orthologs were identified but the P. placenta gene was more highly expressed and/or upregulated relative to the P. chrysosporium gene. Peptides matching Ppl97454, but not its P. chrysosporium ortholog Pchr3388, were detected in culture filtrates. In contrast, both Ppl130413 and Pchr132266 had relatively high transcript levels in BMA medium, and the presence of the corresponding extracellular proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2). The P. placenta and P. chrysosporium genomes feature thousands of hypothetical proteins. Structural features of these protein models are occasionally informative, e.g., secretion signals, but often unreliable and unfulfilling. Transcript and secretome profiles as described here will help to focus future research attention on more manageable subsets of functional genes.This work was supported by the National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service, grant number 2007-35504-18257 to the Forest Products Laboratory, by Office of Science U.S. Department of Energy contract DE-AC02-05CH11231 to the Joint Genome Institute, and by the DOE Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (DOE Office of Science BER DE-FC02-07ER64494).▿Published ahead of print on 16 April 2010.†Supplemental material for this article may be found at http://aem.asm.org/."
PMC2879781,The Biochemistry and Structural Biology of Plant Cell Wall Deconstruction,False,"The cell walls of plants are the most abundant source of organic carbon on the planet. This photosynthetically fixed carbon is recycled by microbial enzymes that convert cell wall polysaccharides to monosaccharides and oligosaccharides, a process that is of biological and industrial importance (Sticklen, 2008; Himmel and Bayer, 2009). Plant cell walls are recalcitrant to biological depolymerization, as the extensive interactions between polysaccharides, and between polysaccharides and lignin, restrict access to the battery of microbial glycoside hydrolases, pectate lyases, and esterases that break down these composite structures (for review, see Mohnen, 2008). Since the early 1990s, there has been an explosion of structural information on both the catalytic and noncatalytic components of these enzymes. This review will provide an overview/update of the structure-function relationships of the enzymes that catalyze plant cell wall deconstruction.Plant cell walls are composed predominantly of the polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, although secondary walls are often rigidified by the impregnation of lignin, a heterogenous aromatic polymer. The structure of the plant cell has been extensively reviewed previously and will be described briefly here (for an overview of plant cell wall structure, see Harris and Stone, 2008; Mohnen, 2008; Mohnen et al., 2008).Cellulose is a β-1,4-linked Glc molecule that is substantially crystalline. All hemicellulosic polysaccharides contain a β-linked sugar backbone. In xylans, mannans, and xyloglucans, the backbone sugars are β-1,4-d-Xyl, β-1,4-d-Man, and β-1,4-d-Glc, respectively, while in glucomannan, the backbone consists of randomly dispersed β-1,4-Glc and β-1,4-Man sugars. The backbones of hemicellulosic polysaccharides are decorated with a variety of sugars and acetyl groups, explaining why these polymers are not crystalline. There are three major forms of pectin: homogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan I, and rhamnogalacturonan II (for review, see Mohnen, 2008). Homogalacturonan consists of a polygalacturonic acid backbone (Mohnen, 2008). Rhamnogalacturonan I displays a backbone composed of an alternating disaccharide, [(α-1,4)-d-GalA→(α-1,2)-l-Rha]n, that contains extensive decorations at the O4 of the Rha residues (Mohnen, 2008). Rhamnogalacturonan II is the most structurally complex of the three pectic polysaccharides, consisting of 13 different sugars and over 20 different linkages (for an extensive review, see O'Neill et al., 2004).Enzymes that modify complex carbohydrates, together with their accessory noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), have been grouped into sequence-based families on the continuously updated Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes (CAZy) database (Cantarel et al., 2009; http://www.cazy.org/). Members of the same enzyme family display a common fold, while the catalytic apparatus and mechanism are similarly conserved. Currently, 44 of the 115 glycoside hydrolase families (GHs) contain enzymes that contribute to plant cell wall deconstruction. Crystal structures of relevant enzymes in 41 of these 44 GHs have been reported. With respect to polysaccharide lyase families (PLs) and carbohydrate esterase families (CEs), six out of 21 PLs and 11 out of 16 CEs contain enzymes that play a role in plant cell wall metabolism. Of the 59 CBM families, around half of these modules bind to components of the plant cell wall, and structural information is available for all but three of these families.While the structures of CEs, PLs, and CBMs are dominated by the α/β-hydrolase (Correia et al., 2008), parallel β-helix (Pickersgill et al., 1994), and jelly roll (or β-sandwich; Czjzek et al., 2001) folds, respectively, there are a large number of different folds within the GHs, which are discussed below. Indeed, the same criteria used to include enzymes in the same GH have now been used to cluster a proportion of the GHs into 14 different clans (Cantarel et al., 2009). The structural biology of plant cell wall-degrading systems provides elegant examples of both convergent and divergent evolution (Fig. 1).Structural convergence and divergence in plant cell wall hydrolases. In the examples shown, a GH28 polygalacturonase (green; Protein Data Bank [PDB] no. 1BHE) and GH49 dextranase (pink; PDB 1OGM) are the clan GH-N representative enzymes. The clan GH-C enzymes are a GH11 xylanase (green; PDB 1BCX) and a GH12 endoglucanase (light blue; PDB 1OA4). The clan GH-A enzymes are a GH5 endoglucanase (magenta; PDB 1A3H), GH26 mannanase (blue; PDB 2BVT), and a GH53 endo-β-1,4-galactanase (green; PDB 1R8L). The catalytic residues are shown in stick format in a darker form of the respective color of the protein fold. Convergent evolution is evident by the observation that xylanases are found in three glycoside hydrolase families that display very different folds.The vast majority of glycoside hydrolases cleave glycosidic bonds by either a single or double displacement mechanism, which leads to inversion or retention of anomeric configuration, respectively (for review, see Rye and Withers, 2000). Polysaccharide lyases cleave their scissile bond through a β-elimination mechanism (Herron et al., 2000). While carbohydrate esterases generally hydrolyze ester linkages through a double displacement mechanism in which Ser (Schubot et al., 2001) or Asp in CE8 (Fries et al., 2007) functions as the catalytic nucleophile, exceptions to this mode of action are apparent in CE4, where catalysis is metal dependent (Taylor et al., 2006).Currently, the crystal structure of the catalytic modules of representatives of nearly all the relevant GHs, PLs, CEs, and CBM families, which contribute to plant cell wall deconstruction, have been reported (Cantarel et al., 2009). Some structural folds have given rise to a myriad of enzymes that display significant differences in specificity, exemplified by the GHs located in clan GH-A. Members of this clan display a (β/α)8-fold in which the catalytic residues are presented at the C terminus of β-strands 4 and 7 (Henrissat et al., 1995; Jenkins et al., 1995). While the enzymes all hydrolyze an equatorial glycosidic bond, their mode of action (exo and endo), specificity for the sugar at the catalytic −1 subsite and more distal regions of the substrate-binding region (Xyl, Man, Glc, Araf, Gal), and the linkage cleaved (e.g. β-1,4, β-1,3) vary between enzymes (Fig. 1). The same enzyme activity can often be found in multiple GHs, located in distinct clans, as a consequence of convergent evolution (Fig. 1). For example, cellulases are located in 11 GHs, with seven of these families distributed across four different clans, while four of these GHs currently are not linked to a clan. There have been several reviews on the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic modules of glycoside hydrolases, including plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (Davies and Henrissat, 1995; Henrissat and Davies, 1997, 2000; Davies et al., 2005; Gilbert et al., 2008). Therefore, this Update will provide a brief overview of the structures of these enzymes and a more detailed description of recent structural information.Cellulose utilization is believed to be mediated by endo-β-1,4-glucanases, cellobiohydrolases (also called exo-β-1,4-glucanases), and β-glucosidases. Classically, cellulose hydrolysis, of which the Hypocrea jecorina (formerly Trichoderma reesei) system is the archetype, is viewed as a synergistic process; endo-acting cellulases create new ends from which the exo-acting cellobiohydrolases can release cellobiose from either the reducing (GH7 and GH48) or nonreducing (GH6) end of the cellulose chains (for review, see Kleywegt et al., 1997; Teeri, 1997). This model, however, is inconsistent with several features of cellulose degradative systems. Thus, biochemical and structural data indicate that GH6 cellobiohydrolases are not, exclusively, exo acting (Amano et al., 1996; Armand et al., 1997; Varrot et al., 1999). Furthermore, some highly active cellulase systems lack a classic pair of cellobiohydrolases that act from the reducing and nonreducing ends of cellulose chains, respectively (Xie et al., 2007; Weiner et al., 2008). Indeed, one of the most distinctive features of the cellulose-degrading bacterium, Cytophaga hutchinsonii, is the absence of GH6, GH48, or GH7 cellobiohydrolases (Xie et al., 2007), although it is possible that the bacterium contains novel cellobiohydrolases. An intriguing report by Tolonen et al. (2009) showed that a single endo-processive GH9 cellulase was essential for cellulose degradation in Clostridium phytofermentans. Given the redundancy in cellulase systems, demonstration that a single enzyme is essential for a functional degradative system is rare and questions the classical synergy model. While there now does not appear to be a single unifying model for cellulose hydrolysis, recent studies, deploying atomic force microscopy to visualize the movement of cellulase molecules on its crystalline substrate, will likely provide novel insights into the mechanism by which these enzymes function (Igarashi et al., 2009).Plant cellulases are restricted to a very small number of families exemplified by Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), whose genome encodes 25 cellulases (endoglucanases) all in GH9. Phylogenetic analysis of the Arabidopsis GH9s points to three distinct subfamilies: α, β, and γ. Biochemical studies on γ-endoglucanases show that they are approximately 100-fold less active than the corresponding microbial enzymes, reflecting the loss of a critical aromatic residue at the −2 subsite (Master et al., 2004). This reinforces a remodeling role, rather than a degradative role, for these membrane-associated cellulases. A cohort of the α-endoglucanases contains a C-terminal module that binds to cellulose (Urbanowicz et al., 2007), which has functional implications discussed below.The β-1,4-glucan backbone of xyloglucan is hydrolyzed by specific endoglucanases (i.e. endo-xyloglucanase or xyloglucan endo-hydrolases) from GH5, GH7, GH12, GH16, GH44, and GH74. GH12 enzymes can tolerate the side chains in xyloglucan. Indeed, GH5 and GH74 endoxyloglucanases can make productive interactions with the α-1,6-Xyl decorations and, in the case of the GH5 enzymes, Gal pendants of the Xyl residues (Martinez-Fleites et al., 2006; Gloster et al., 2007). Maybe the most interesting aspect of xyloglucan modification is found in GH16, where enzymes may display endoxyloglucanase activity or, in the case of XETs, remodel the structure of the polysaccharide through transglycosylation reactions (Baumann et al., 2007). This article will not discuss these GH16 enzymes, which are covered in detail in the review by Eklöf and Brumer (2010; this issue).β-Mannanases display a (β/α)8 barrel fold and are located within GH5 and GH26, while β-mannosidases are GH2 enzymes; all three GHs are within clan GH-A. The crystal structures of β-mannanases generally reveal an open active-site cleft with at least four subsites. An unusual feature of β-mannanases is that substrate specificity is not conferred by the recognition of Man in its relaxed chair conformation (4C1) at the critical −1 subsite (glycosidic bond cleavage occurs between the sugars bound at the −1 and +1 subsites; Davies et al., 1997) but through the B2,5 topology displayed by the oxocarbonium transition state (Ducros et al., 2002; Tailford et al., 2007; Cartmell et al., 2008).In addition to mannan, β-mannanases hydrolyze glucomannan, a heterogenous β-1,4-linked polymer of Glc and Man. β-Mannanases are defined by their capacity to hydrolyze mannosidic bonds, which requires that Man is positioned in the −1 subsite. Recognition of Man and Glc at subsites distal to −1 is highly variable, although some general trends are emerging that point to a divergence in specificity between GH5 and GH26 mannanases. GH5 mannanases are able to accommodate Glc at the −2 and +1 subsites (Tailford et al., 2009) and are thus able to hydrolyze mannosidic linkages flanked by Man or Glc. Indeed, one of these enzymes, BaMan5A, does not recognize O2 as a specificity determinant at any subsite distal to −1. Thus, while BaMan5A hydrolyzes only mannosidic bonds, the topographical features of the substrate-binding cleft of this enzyme are optimized to utilize glucomannan as its preferred substrate (Tailford et al., 2009). The relaxed specificity for Glc or Man, apart from the critical −1 subsite, is a feature shared with the other GH5 mannanases, where structural information is available.In contrast, the GH26 mannanases characterized to date generally display tight specificity for Man at both the −2 and −1 subsites. Indeed, a cohort of GH26 mannanases contain an Arg at the −2 subsite that makes extensive interactions with the substrate and appears to confer unusually high activity against small mannooligosaccharides (Ducros et al., 2002; Cartmell et al., 2008). Screening genomic databases for other GH26 enzymes that retain this Arg may facilitate the identification of novel mannooligosaccharidases. Currently, the two Cellvibrio enzymes that contain a high-affinity −2 subsite do not possess additional negative binding subsites, which may explain why the high activity displayed against mannotriose and mannotetraose is not translated to the hydrolysis of polysaccharides (Hogg et al., 2001; Cartmell et al., 2008).The xylan backbone is hydrolyzed primarily by GH10 and GH11 xylanases, while the Araf side chains are removed by arabinofuranosidases from GH43, GH51, GH54, and GH62 (for review of xylan degradation, see Gilbert et al., 2008). The uronic side chains are released from the nonreducing end of xylooligosaccharides by GH67 α-glucuronidases (Nurizzo et al., 2002), although recent data showed that GH115 α-glucuronidases remove the uronic acid decorations from the internal regions of xylan (Ryabova et al., 2009). Each of these families contains at least one structural representative, with the exception of GH62 and GH115 (http://www.cazy.org). GH43 enzymes may display the highest level of substrate diversity, exemplified by the activity of two arabinofuranosidases from this family that remove the O3 side chain from Xyl residues that are decorated at both O2 and O3 with Araf (van den Broek et al., 2005; Sorensen et al., 2006). The crystal structure of this enzyme (H.J. Gilbert, unpublished data) reveals an extended substrate-binding pocket that interacts with both O2- and O3-linked Araf. By contrast, an arabinoxylan-specific GH43 arabinofuranosidase, which removes O2- or O3-linked Araf side chains from singularly substituted Xyl residues, contains a small substrate-binding pocket embedded in a shallow cleft that is optimized to bind the 3-fold helical structure of the xylan backbone (Vandermarliere et al., 2009). Recent protein crystallographic studies have shown that xylan side chains can be accommodated and can actually be exploited as specificity determinants (Pell et al., 2004; Vardakou et al., 2005), while a GH5 xylanase displays an absolute requirement for 4-O-methyl-d-GlcUA appended to the Xyl positioned at the −2 subsite (Vrsanska et al., 2007). There are two structures of this enzyme (Larson et al., 2003; St John et al., 2009); however, the mechanism by which the enzyme recognizes the uronic acid side chain remains unclear.The structures of pectinases (polygalacturonases), pectate lyases, and pectin methylesterases have been extensively described and reviewed previously (Jenkins and Pickersgill, 2001). In general, these enzymes display a right-handed parallel β-helix topology. Exceptions include PL10 pectate lyases, which adopt an (α/α)6 toroid conformation (Charnock et al., 2002b), and PL2 lyases, which display a (α/α)7 barrel and utilize manganese rather than calcium in the active site (Abbott and Boraston, 2007). The catalytic apparatus in PL10, and those displaying a β-helix fold, is conserved, providing an example of convergent evolution (Charnock et al., 2002b). An Arg is the most likely candidate catalytic base in these PLs. The basic residue abstracts the C5 proton, which, in several PL families (PL2, PL9, and PL10), results in the formation of an enolate-enolate intermediate in which the two negatively charged oxygens are stabilized by calcium and hydrogen bonds. The collapse of the intermediate results in the cleavage of the scissile bond, although the mechanism by which the leaving group (glycosidic oxygen) is protonated remains unclear. An interesting variation of this catalytic mechanism has been proposed for PL1 lyases. It was suggested that the PL1 lyase generates an enol-enolate through donation of a proton by a nearby Lys to one of the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate. The authors suggest that through this intermediate, PL1 lyases are more active than PL10 and PL9 enzymes that can only generate the enolate-enolate intermediate (Seyedarabi et al., 2010).Recent advances have also been made in understanding the processive mechanism displayed by pectin methyl esterases, which yield blocks of nonmethylated GalUA (GalA). Structural and biochemical data show that the enzyme demethylates the sugar at the +1 subsite and uses the negative charge of the carboxylate as a specificity determinant at the −1 subsite and to some extent at −2, while +3 makes hydrophobic contact with the methyl group of the esterified uronic acid (Fries et al., 2007). Thus, after removing the methyl group, the GalA generated then slides along the substrate-binding cleft to occupy the −1 site; thus, a new methylated GalA is presented in the crucial +1 subsite. This progressive sliding of pectin along the substrate-binding cleft is encouraged further by the specificity displayed by the +3 and −2 subsites.The structural basis for the GH6 and GH7 cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases is well established and has been extensively reviewed (Kleywegt et al., 1997; Teeri, 1997; Varrot et al., 1999). Recent structural data have also provided insight into how subtle structural changes can convert endo-acting glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases into exo-acting enzymes. Thus, small loop extensions surrounding the distal subsite that accommodates the nonreducing end of the substrate create steric constraints that prevent extension of the substrate beyond this subsite. Variants of these enzymes, in which the loop extensions have been removed, display an endo mode of action (Proctor et al., 2005; Cartmell et al., 2008; Ochiai et al., 2009; Fig. 2).An overlay of an endo (CjMan26A; green) and an exo (CjMan26C; cyan) β-mannanase from Cellvibrio japonicas. A small extension of the loop at the distal −2 subsite presents two residues, Asp-130 and Leu-129, shown in stick format in purple. These residues present a steric block that prevents extension of substrate distal to the sugar bound at the −2 subsite. The residues shown in dark blue, in the surface representations of the two enzymes, are Asp-130 in CjMan26C and the equivalent amino acid (Glu-121) in CjMan26A.The crystal structures of several glycosyltransferases in numerous GT families have been reported in the last decade. The data have revealed only two major folds for these enzymes, while also providing insights into the likely catalytic mechanisms displayed by inverting and retaining glycosyltransferases (for review, see Lairson et al., 2008). These studies, however, have focused, almost exclusively, on enzymes that are not membrane associated, and currently, there is no high-resolution crystal structural information on glycosyltransferases that contribute to plant cell wall synthesis. Cellulose synthase, however, can be visualized by freeze-fracture techniques, in conjunction with immunological methods. The data revealed six globular complexes approximately 25 nm in diameter. Each of the six subunits (each subunit contains multiple cellulose synthase molecules) of these rosettes synthesize multiple β-1,4-glucan chains, which cocrystallize to form microfibrils (for review, see Somerville, 2006). Although issues remain concerning the nature of the primer and the direction of chain growth elongation (although elongation from the nonreducing end is the preferred model), the lack of detailed structural information on these enzymes precludes further discussion of this enzyme system here. It is evident, however, that using genetic approaches, Arabidopsis plant cell wall glycosyltransferases have been identified and, in some instances, predicted activities have been verified by detecting appropriate transfer reactions in heterologous hosts (for review, see Liepman et al., 2010). It is evident that in the next few years there will be rapid advances in the identification of glycosyltransferase genes that encode plant cell wall-synthesizing enzymes. It is highly likely that the resultant data will underpin the much needed detailed structural and biochemical information of these plant cell wall glcosyltransferases.Microbial plant cell wall hydrolases display complex molecular architectures in which the catalytic module is appended, by flexible linker sequences, to one or more CBMs (for review, see Boraston et al., 2004). In some of the 59 CBM families, exemplified by CBM1, CBM10, and CBM20, ligand specificity is invariant (Linder and Teeri, 1997; Southall et al., 1999; Raghothama et al., 2000), while in some families, such as CBM6 (Czjzek et al., 2001; Pires et al., 2004), CBM4 (Boraston et al., 2002b), and CBM35 (Tunnicliffe et al., 2005; Montanier et al., 2009b), carbohydrate recognition is highly variable. In addition to defining a phylogenetic relationship between CBMs by clustering these modules into sequence-based families, they have also been classified into three categories (types A, B, and C) based on the topology of their ligand-binding sites and their mode of ligand recognition (for review, see Boraston et al., 2004; Fig. 3).Examples of type A, type B, and type C CBMs. CBM2a is derived from the Cellulomonas fimi xylanase Xyn10A (Protein Data Bank [PDB] 1XG), CBM15 is a component of the C. japonicas xylanase Xyn10C (PDB 1GNY), and CBM9 is from a Thermotoga maritima GH10 xylanase (PDB 1I82). The folds are ramped from blue (N terminus) to red (C terminus). The three aromatic residues that form a ligand-binding apolar surface in the CBM2a module are colored red and are shown in stick format in the respective surface and fold depictions of the protein.CBMs have now been described that bind to the major polysaccharides found in the plant cell wall (for review, see Boraston et al., 2004), while modules that recognize the side chains of these polymers, and the products released through their deconstruction, have also been identified (Notenboom et al., 2001; Miyanaga et al., 2004; Montanier et al., 2009b). In general, the ligand specificity of CBMs reflects the substrate cleaved by the cognate enzyme (discussed further below). Many of these enzymes, however, also contain a CBM that binds to crystalline cellulose (Kellett et al., 1990; McKie et al., 2001; Hogg et al., 2003). It has been suggested that once bound, these type A modules are able to slide across the surface of cellulose (Jervis et al., 1997), enabling the substrate-specific type B and type C CBMs to lock onto its ligand and thus direct the enzyme to its target glycosidic bonds (Kellett et al., 1990).In general, the affinity of CBMs for their target plant-derived ligands is low (Kd of approximately 100 μm; Boraston et al., 2004). Some enzymes, however, contain multiple copies of CBMs that display the same specificity, and in these proteins, avidity effects between these modules have led to increased affinity for polysaccharides (Bolam et al., 2001; Freelove et al., 2001; Boraston et al., 2002a). It is interesting that nature has deployed CBM duplication as a mechanism for increased affinity rather than increasing the interactions between ligand and a single CBM module. It is possible that as CBMs generally bind to ligands that are in intimate contact with other components of the plant cell wall, steric constraints prevent extensive interactions between the protein and target carbohydrate.CBMs are less prevalent among plant glycoside hydrolases that cleave structural polysaccharides; however, several CBM49 and CBM22 modules are present in plant cellulases and xylanases, respectively. The CBM49 modules are located in a subfamily of GH9 plant endoglucanases, and one of these modules was shown to bind tightly to crystalline cellulose (Urbanowicz et al., 2007). It is possible that the GH9 CBM49-containing endoglucanases play a role in modulating the structure of crystalline cellulose.The mechanism by which CBMs potentiate catalysis remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that cellulose-specific CBMs may play a key role in disrupting the ordered hydrogen-bonding network in crystalline cellulose, making the surface chains accessible to the appended cellulase (Knowles et al., 1987; Teeri, 1997). There is biochemical, biophysical, and microscopic data (Din et al., 1994; Wang et al., 2008) indicating that CBMs mediate changes to the surface structure of cellulose. Furthermore, the addition of CBMs in trans to the cognate catalytic module has led to a modest potentiation (0.2- to 1.5-fold) in catalytic activity against insoluble substrates (Din et al., 1994; Moser et al., 2008). Cellulases, typically endoglucanases, however, are often 3 orders of magnitude more active against soluble forms of cellulose than the crystalline polysaccharide (Durrant et al., 1991; Irwin et al., 1993). Thus, CBMs acting in trans have only a minor influence on the access problem, although this might reflect the dissociation of the targeting and (possible) disrupting function of these modules. Of potential significance is the location of crystalline cellulose-specific CBMs in many enzymes that display no cellulase activity (Kellett et al., 1990; McKie et al., 2001; Hogg et al., 2003; Vincent et al., 2010), which argues against these modules having a specialized function in cellulose degradation. A more likely explanation for the capacity of CBMs to increase the activity of glycoside hydrolases against insoluble substrates is that they reduce the “accessibility problem” by bringing the appended catalytic modules into intimate and prolonged association with their target substrate, thereby enhancing catalytic efficiency.In several organisms, however, there are populations of CBMs that are not components of enzymes, and these modules may destabilize the crystalline structure of some polysaccharides. Thus, CBM33, which is highly expressed in chitin-degrading bacteria such as Serratia marcescens, potentiates the chitinases from this organism, particularly during the latter stages of the degradative process when the glycoside hydrolases are attacking highly crystalline forms of the polysaccharide (Vaaje-Kolstad et al., 2005a). More modest potentiation of cellulases by “noncatalytic” bacterial CBMs has also been reported (Moser et al., 2008), while it has been suggested that several noncatalytic fungal proteins may play a role in plant cell wall disruption. It is believed that the primary function of GH61s (now established as fungal noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding proteins) is to disrupt plant cell wall structure and thus increase the access of degradative enzymes to their substrates (Rosgaard et al., 2006; Karkehabadi et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2010). Indeed, fungi often contain multiple copies of this protein, and they are coexpressed with a range of cellulases (Vanden Wymelenberg et al., 2009). Another potential fungal CBM33 analog is swollenin from Trichoderma reesei, which appears to have disruptive effects on cellulose, although recent studies suggest that the protein may display endoglycanase activities (Yao et al., 2008). In addition to microorganisms, plants (and plant cell wall-degrading nematodes) also produce proteins, referred to as expansins, that mediate a relaxation in the structure of the cell wall (for review, see Cosgrove, 2000). Expansins mechanically weaken plant cell walls (McQueen-Mason and Cosgrove, 1994), and their use in improving cellulase efficiency has been reported (Han and Chen, 2007). Currently, GH61s and expansins appear to disrupt the cellulose-hemicellulose interface, while the functional importance of swollenin remains opaque.The structure of a CBM33 reveals a binding surface that contains several conserved polar residues that are pivotal to the synergistic effects of this protein with chitinases (Vaaje-Kolstad et al., 2005b). Significantly, mutations that prevented the CBM33 from potentiating chitinase activity had little effect on the affinity of the protein for chitin. This led to the proposal that the specific polar interactions between chitin and the protein disrupt the hydrogen-binding network between individual polysaccharide chains (Vaaje-Kolstad et al., 2005b). This could also explain the specificities displayed by CBM33 modules. The crystal structures of GH61s from Hypocrea jecorina (Karkehabadi et al., 2008) and Thielavia terrestris (Harris et al., 2010) reveal a similar surface to CBM33, again pointing to a disruptive function for these proteins.While the effects of noncatalytic proteins on cellulose hydrolysis, to date, have been disappointing, continued efforts at identifying the functional significance of these molecules is merited. For example, it is possible that specific combinations of these proteins are required to disrupt the structure of cellulose, while, currently, the influence of these accessory proteins has been explored only in isolation.The three-dimensional structures of representatives of 21 of the 24 CBM families that target the plant cell wall have been determined (for review, see Boraston et al., 2004). The vast majority of these modules display a jelly roll fold comprising two antiparallel β-sheets that form the two surfaces of these proteins. Ligand binding occurs on the concave surface presented by one of the β-sheets (Boraston et al., 2002b) or in the loops that connect the two β-sheets (defined hereafter as site 1; Czjzek et al., 2001; Montanier et al., 2009b).CBMs that bind crystalline cellulose contain three aromatic amino acids that adopt a planar topology with respect to each other (Kraulis et al., 1989; Xu et al., 1995; Tormo et al., 1996; Raghothama et al., 2000). These residues make extensive hydrophobic contacts with fully exposed sugar rings presented at the 110 face of cellulose crystals (Lehtio et al., 2003). Ligand recognition by these CBMs is driven primarily through an increase in entropy, resulting in the desolvation of the interacting macromolecules (Creagh et al., 1996). By contrast, enthalpy drives the binding of CBMs to discreet polysaccharide chains, where both polar and apolar interactions occur, while entropy has a negative impact on overall affinity (Charnock et al., 2000, 2002a; Bolam et al., 2001; Boraston et al., 2002a, 2002b). The negative entropy may reflect conformational restriction of the ligand bound to the protein, which is not entirely offset by the release of tightly bound water molecules (for review, see Boraston et al., 2004). It should be recognized, however, that the energetic freedom of the solvating molecules of the protein is a controversial issue; thus, the molecular basis for the thermodynamic forces that drive ligand recognition in type B CBMs remains unclear.Subtle changes in structure can lead to significant changes in ligand specificity, exemplified by xylan and cellulose specificity within CBM2, which is defined by the conformation adopted by the surface aromatic residues, which are perpendicular in xylan-binding modules and planar in cellulose-binding modules (Simpson et al., 1999, 2000), consistent with the conformation adopted by the two polysaccharides. The perpendicular arrangement of surface Trps in xylan-binding CBM2s is mediated by an Arg, while in cellulose-binding CBM2s, the basic residue is replaced by a Gly, enabling the Trp to collapse onto the surface of the protein and adopt a planar orientation with respect to the other aromatic residues (Simpson et al., 2000). While the perpendicular arrangement of aromatic residues in xylan-binding CBMs is a common feature, modules that recognize the hemicellulosic polymer can adopt different ligand-binding strategies. Thus, in CBM4, CBM6, and CBM22, xylan recognition is dominated by a single Xyl residue that is sandwiched between a pair of planar aromatic residues within a deep ligand-binding cleft (Czjzek et al., 2001; Charnock et al., 2002a; Simpson et al., 2002). While this binding mode confers higher affinity for isolated xylan chains, CBMs that recognize xylan through the asymmetric distribution of aromatic residues display more versatile ligand recognition; they are able to bind to the hemicellulose within in a variety of terrestrial plant cell walls, a specificity that is not displayed by the modules from CBM4, CBM6, and CBM22 (McCartney et al., 2006).While CBMs that bind to internal regions of polysaccharides display an open cleft topology, the shape of the cleft influences specificity. This is exemplified in CBM4, where structurally related modules bind to linear β-1,4-polysaccharides, such as cellulose, or highly curved structures, such as β-1,3-glucan (Boraston et al., 2002a). In CfCBM4-1, both ends of the cleft are open, enabling the protein to bind linear glucan chains such as cellulose. However, insertions in two loops confer a U-shape topology on the longitudinal axis of the binding cleft of TmCBM4-2, which is complementary to the curved conformation adopted by its ligand, β-1,3-glucan. A more extreme example of how topological changes can cause a dramatic change in ligand specificity is evident in site 1 in CBM6 modules. This site may adopt a pocket-like topology and thus recognize the termini of polysaccharide chains (Pires et al., 2004) or display an open cleft and bind to the internal regions of xylan (Czjzek et al., 2001). From the discussion above, it is apparent that CBMs, in common with lectins, display preformed carbohydrate-recognition sites that mirror the solution conformations of their target ligands, thereby minimizing the energetic penalty paid upon binding.Glucomannan (contains a random distribution of β-1,4-linked d-Man and d-Glc residues) presents a significant challenge with respect to CBM specificity. While mannan-specific CBMs recognize the regions of glucomannan containing successive Man residues (Tunnicliffe et al., 2005), two CBM families, CBM29 and CBM16, contain proteins that display specificity for the heterogenous polymer in addition to cellulose and mannan. In these modules, the aromatic residues in the binding cleft make planar contacts with sugars at n and n + 2 and thus avoid steric clashes with the axial O2 in the Man residues. In addition, several polar residues are capable of making hydrogen bonds with the axial or equatorial O2 of Man or Glc, respectively; while at other sugar-binding subsites, O2 is not a specificity determinant (Charnock et al., 2002a; Bae et al., 2008). CBMs have also been shown to harness both the backbone and side chain of decorated glucans such as xyloglucan (Najmudin et al., 2006). Specificity for this polymer has also been engineered into a xylan-specific module (Gunnarsson et al., 2006), while recent structural information on this protein provides insight into how the observed change in specificity was achieved (Gullfot et al., 2010).CBMs, which display a jelly roll fold, contain a highly conserved structural calcium (for review, see Boraston et al., 2004). Furthermore, there are increasing examples of CBMs where calcium plays a direct or indirect role in ligand recognition in site 1. Thus, in Aga16B-CBM6-2, calcium orientates a Tyr such that it can interact with the neoagarose ligand (Henshaw et al., 2006), while in CBM36 (and a second xylan-specific CBM; H.J. Gilbert, unpublished data), the metal ion coordinates with the O2 and O3 of Xyl residues within xylan (Jamal-Talabani et al., 2004). A cohort of six CBM35s (three of these modules are identical but are located in different xylan-degrading enzymes) were recently shown to bind to uronic acids, where calcium makes critical electrostatic interactions with the C6 carboxylate (Montanier et al., 2009b). Subtle differences in the ligand-binding site in this cohort of CBM35s confer differences in ligand specificity. The modules derived from the pectin-metabolizing enzymes bind only to Δ4,5-anhydrogalacturonic acid, while the other CBM35s recognize both the pectin degradation product and GlcUA (Montanier et al., 2009b).Within the context of plant cell wall degradation, the catalytic and CBM functions are conferred by discrete regions of the multimodular enzymes that catalyze this process. Recently, however, a CE2 esterase, CtCE2, which is appended to a GH5 endoglucanase, was shown to have a noncatalytic cellulose-binding function in addition to displaying esterase activity; other modules in this esterase family (which are not appended to other catalytic modules) do not recognize cellulose. The crystal structure of CtCE2 shows that cellulose binds to the active site of the esterase through hydrophobic interactions with three aromatic residues and by hydrogen bonds with components of the catalytic apparatus. The crystal structures of other CE2 esterases showed that these enzymes lack one or more of the three aromatic residues, explaining why they do not recognize cellulose. The CE2 family encapsulates the requirement for multiple activities by biocatalysts that attack challenging macromolecular substrates such as the plant cell wall, including the grafting of a second, powerful, and discrete noncatalytic binding functionality into the active site of an enzyme. This report provides a rare example of “gene sharing” (Montanier et al., 2009a), where the introduction of a second functionality into the active site of an enzyme does not compromise the original activity of the biocatalyst (Fig. 4).The structural features of the active site of CtCE2 that displays esterase and a CBM function. The catalytic module of CtCE2 contains two discrete domains that display a typical α/β-hydrolase fold (blue), evident in Ser esterases, and a jelly roll fold (red), respectively. The surface representation of CtCE2 reveals a cleft that accommodates cellopentaose (shown in yellow) and houses the active site of the esterase. The three aromatic residues that play a key role in binding cellulose are shown in red. The active site of three CE2 esterases show cellopentaose (gray) and the three aromatic residues (green) from CtCE2, the two aromatic residues (magenta) in CjCE2B, and the single aromatic amino acid (yellow) in CjCE2A. All three enzymes are Ser esterases, and the catalytic triad (Ser-160, His-335, Asp-333) of CE2A is displayed in yellow.As discussed above, type B CBMs generally bind to substrates of the catalytic modules. Exceptions to this rule include a xylanase-derived CBM9, which binds the reducing end of xylan or cellulose (Notenboom et al., 2001), while CBM35s, located in pectin-metabolizing enzymes, bind to the reaction products generated by pectate lyases (Montanier et al., 2009b). It would appear, therefore, that these CBMs are recruiting enzymes to regions of the cell wall where the target substrates for the appended enzymes are undergoing degradation; thus, in a sense, the modules are directing the catalytic apparatus to areas of the wall that are susceptible to degradation. The CBM35 appended to three xylan-degrading enzymes binds to both GlcUA (GlcA) and the unsaturated product released by pectate lyases but not to 4-O-methyl-d-GlcUA, the more common uronic acid found in xylans. The biological rationale for this dual specificity is unclear. It has been proposed that in model plants, such as Arabidopsis, in rapidly dividing cells there are significant quantities of unmethylated GlcA (Pena et al., 2007). This has led to the hypothesis that, by targeting unmethylated GlcA, the CBM is directing enzymes to more open structures that are particularly susceptible to enzyme degradation. It is possible that this cohort of CBM35s initially direct the xylan-degrading apparatus to regions of cell walls that are being actively degraded, for which anhydrogalacturonic is a marker, but, as xylan structures are revealed, the enzyme is shuttled onto the hemicellulosic polysaccharide, affording the enzyme access to its target substrate (Montanier et al., 2009b).Recent studies have also shown that CBMs can display a bacterial anchoring function. Thus, the CBM35 from the Amycolatopsis orientalis exo-β-d-glucosaminidase (Chi-CBM35) tethers the enzyme to the cell wall of the bacterium (Montanier et al., 2009b). Similarly, a family of CBMs unique to Ruminococcus albus, which bind to a wide spectrum of β-linked plant structural polysaccharides (CBM37), anchor their cognate enzymes to the surface of the bacterium (Ezer et al., 2008). The biological rationale for this CBM function appears to be to keep the enzymes in close proximity to the bacterium. However, Ezer et al. (2008) also proposed a model in which the CBM37 acts as a shuttle that transfers the appended enzymes from the bacterial surface to the plant cell wall. In any event, these recent reports of the cell adhesion role of CBMs, which was previously unconsidered, may prove to factor prominently in the function of these protein modules in the future.In the last 15 years, there have been significant advances in the three-dimensional structural analysis of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. The data have informed our understanding of the mechanism of both catalysis and substrate recognition, which has led to the identification of numerous “specificity motifs,” some of which are described in this article. It is evident, however, that the explosion of genomic and metagenomic information is resulting in an exponential increase in the identification of CAZy enzymes. This has resulted in a significant imbalance between the number of enzymes in CAZy families and the biochemical/structural analysis of these proteins. Indeed, only around 3% of the proteins in CAZy have a characterized biochemical activity, while three-dimensional structural information is only available for 0.3% of these enzymes (Cantarel et al., 2009). It is estimated that we can safely predict the activities of no more than 20% of the proteins within CAZy. The situation is compounded further by the difficulties in determining the biochemical properties of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, where the chemical complexity and requirement for a hierarchical degradative process create significant functional barriers. Notwithstanding these problems, continued biochemical and structural information is urgently required if we are to fully integrate information obtained from the “omics” technologies to understand the biology of plant cell wall deconstruction. Indeed, integrating structure, function, and phylogenetics to develop predictive models for ligand/substrate specificity is an important goal for structural biologists working on plant cell wall-modifying enzymes. An example of such an analysis was developed recently by Abbott et al. (2009). Deploying CBM6 as a model system, they were able to identify two regions that appear to be “hot spots” of primary and tertiary structure variation, which confer functional specificity in these modules, a view supported by the recent characterization of a Xyl-specific CBM6. A more general phylogenetic analysis of endoglucanases belonging to several GHs was also insightful in providing a predictive platform for glycoside hydrolase activities (Vlasenko et al., 2010). As discussed above, the characterization of glycosyltransferases that catalyze the synthesis of plant structural polysaccharides represents the biggest challenge in the cell wall field. It is evident that a significant investment is required to develop our understanding of the structure-function relationships of these enzymes, which is essential if we are to fully understand the mechanism for the biogenesis of the plant cell wall."
PMC2879796,"The XTH Gene Family: An Update on Enzyme Structure, Function, and Phylogeny in Xyloglucan Remodeling1",False,"The xyloglucan family of polysaccharides continues to be the focus of much attention due to the central role these highly branched glycans play in contemporary plant cell wall models (Cosgrove, 2005). In such models, xyloglucans figure as key cross-linking molecules, which are responsible for coating and tethering the load-bearing paracrystalline cellulose fibrils (Pauly et al., 1999) in a composite hydrogel of neutral and ionic polysaccharides and structural proteins. In particular, fucogalactoxyloglucans, arabinoxyloglucans, and arabinogalactoxyloglucans are found in the primary walls of all vascular plants analyzed thus far, where they may constitute up to 20% of the dry weight of the wall (graminaceous monocots are a notable exception: xyloglucan is present at less than 5% and arabinoxylans and mixed-linkage β-glucans dominate; Hoffman et al., 2005; Cavalier et al., 2008; Fincher, 2009; Hsieh and Harris, 2009). The presence of xyloglucans in early land plants suggests a pivotal role in the transition from water to drier habitats (Popper, 2008). In addition to wall structural functions, nonfucosylated galactoxyloglucans have been recruited as storage polysaccharides by some species as sources of both hexoses and pentoses for developing embryos (Reid, 1985; Buckeridge et al., 2000).The ubiquity of xyloglucans in the plant kingdom has spurred an ever-growing body of research on the diverse structures and biological roles of these polysaccharides, and recent years have witnessed a significant expansion of our understanding of the enzymology of xyloglucan biosynthesis, rearrangement, and degradation. Elegant work from the Keegstra and Reiter groups has elucidated the identity of a handful of plant glycosyltransferases responsible for xyloglucan assembly, thus providing the first glimpse of the players involved in this complex process (Cavalier et al., 2008; Zabotina et al., 2008, and refs. therein). In the opposite direction, detailed structure-function analyses are highlighting plant and microbial enzymes across a range of glycoside hydrolase (GH) families with a penchant for xyloglucan disassembly, including both backbone- and side chain-cleaving activities (Gilbert et al., 2008; Vlasenko et al., 2010). Microbial enzymes with significant endo-hydrolytic activity toward xyloglucan chains have been identified in no less than six GH families (Gilbert et al., 2008; Vlasenko et al., 2010), a convergent evolution that highlights the importance of foraging this abundant polysaccharide for saprophytes (for a broader perspective on cell wall saccharification by microbes, see the Update by H.J. Gilbert in this issue [Gilbert, 2010]).In contrast, plant enzymes responsible for the cleavage and/or rearrangement of xyloglucan backbones in muro have so far only been identified in GH16, although this limited distribution certainly belies their importance. The XYLOGLUCAN ENDO-TRANSGLYCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE (XTH) genes encode proteins that can potentially have two distinct catalytic activities, with radically different effects on xyloglucan: xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase (XET) activity (formally, xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase; EC 2.4.1.207) results in the nonhydrolytic cleavage and ligation of xyloglucan chains, whereas xyloglucan endo-hydrolase (XEH) activity (formally, xyloglucan-specific endo-β-1,4-glucanase; EC 3.2.151) yields irreversible chain shortening. (Note: XTH has alternately been defined as XYLOGLUCAN ENDO-TRANSGLUCOSYLASE/HYDROLASE [Rose et al., 2002], although this is not strictly correct. An entire glycan chain is transferred, not a single glucosyl residue; compare 4-α-glucanotransferase, EC 2.4.1.25; and 1,4-α-glucan 6-α-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.24; etc.).Since their initial discovery in the early 1990s, XETs have figured prominently in plant cell wall models, due to the potential of these enzymes to cause transient matrix cleavage without hydrolysis, thus providing a potential molecular mechanism for controlled, turgor-driven wall expansion (Rose et al., 2002). Indeed, XETs have been implicated in both wall-loosening and wall-strengthening roles, gravitropic responses, as well as the incorporation of nascent xyloglucan into the wall during biosynthesis (Rose et al., 2002; Cosgrove, 2005; Mellerowicz et al., 2008). And while the biomechanical roles of XETs are still being debated (Cosgrove, 2005; Van Sandt et al., 2007b), it is doubtless that XTH gene products are important: higher plants maintain large XTH gene families (composed of 20–60 genes; Fig. 1B) whose members are actively transcribed in tissue-, time-, and stimulus-dependent contexts (Rose et al., 2002; Yokoyama et al., 2004; Becnel et al., 2006; Mellerowicz and Sundberg, 2008; Miedes and Lorences, 2009).The evolution of GH16 and grouping of XTH genes in publicly available plant genomes. A, The proposed evolution of clan B containing GH7 and GH16 (updated from Michel et al. [2001]). B, A simplified tree showing the genome representatives of the Plantae (top) and a diagram showing the distribution of XTH genes into groups (bottom), with the number of genes from each organism at the top of each column (only XTH genes predicted to encode functional XTH gene products [i.e. containing a complete active-site motif] are included). The groups are colored as follows: group 1, black; group II, light gray; group III-A, white; group III-B, dark gray. The Chlorophyta are represented by the genomes of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (http://phytozome.org/), Micromonas pusilla (Worden et al., 2009), Ostreococcus tauri (Derelle et al., 2006), and Ostreococcus lucimarinus (Palenik et al., 2007). All other genome data are available via http://www.phytozome.org/ (accessed March 2010).To understand the physiological effects of individual XTH gene products in diverse processes such as seed germination, organogenesis, cell expansion, and fruit ripening, it is essential to understand their biochemistry. In particular, it is necessary to know whether a regulated transcript encodes a strict XET devoid of kinetically relevant hydrolytic activity, a strict XEH with no capacity to rearrange the xyloglucan network except through irreversible degradation, or an enzyme with mixed function.Since the last major review in 2002 (Rose et al., 2002), there have been significant advances in the understanding of protein structure-function relationships encoded by the XTH gene family, including the first three-dimensional structures of a plant XET (Johansson et al., 2004) and a plant XEH (Baumann et al., 2007). The focus of this Update will thus highlight key aspects of enzyme structure, mechanism, and molecular phylogeny, which underpin ongoing genetic studies of XTH gene products and their individual physiological roles. Other contemporary reviews provide lucid overviews of the literature on primary and secondary wall physiological studies involving XTHs (Cosgrove, 2005; Mellerowicz et al., 2008), which will not be covered further here.The proteins encoded by XTH genes comprise a subfamily of GH16 in the Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy) classification (Cantarel et al., 2009), which groups enzymes on the basis of structural and mechanistic similarity (Davies and Henrissat, 1995; Davies et al., 2005). GH16 enzymes display a diversity of substrate specificities, with family members cleaving β-1,3 or β-1,4 bonds in various glucans and galactans. GH16 enzymes are also distantly related to the GH7 cellulases within clan GH-B (Michel et al., 2001; Eklöf, 2010). (Clans are groups of GH families with a conserved three-dimensional structure and catalytic machinery despite low amino acid sequence similarity and differing substrate specificity; see http://www.cazy.org/.) Within GH16, the XTH gene products are most closely related to bacterial β-1,3;1,4-glucan hydrolases and fungal CRH (for CONGO RED HYPERSENSITIVE) gene products implicated in cross-linking chitin to β-1,6- and β-1,3-glucans (Cabib et al., 2008; Fig. 1A).The molecular phylogeny of XTH genes and gene products, which was originally divided into three major groups (I, II, and III; Campbell and Braam, 1999a), has undergone continual revision as a consequence of an ever-increasing body of sequence information. Indeed, just over 10 years ago, there were approximately 50 XTH gene product sequences (Campbell and Braam, 1999a). As a result of numerous plant genome sequencing projects (http://www.phytozome.org/), this number has increased to several hundred, with the result that original phylogenetic differences are beginning to become blurred. Indeed, already in 2004, a comparison of the first two public plant genomes, rice (Oryza sativa; a monocot) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; a dicot), indicated that groups I and II had become indistinguishable (Yokoyama et al., 2004). This observation has been mirrored by the analysis of other large data sets (Baumann et al., 2007; Michailidis et al., 2009).The validation of a subfamily rests in statistical robustness as well as the ability of such groupings to predict enzyme characteristics and/or in vivo functional differences. Within the composite group I/II, there are a number of statistically robust clades, although there is no evidence (thus far) that these clades harbor significantly different activities. Indeed, heterologously expressed XTH genes from this group have all exhibited exclusively XET activity (Supplemental Table S1), although in most cases donor and acceptor substrate specificities have not been extensively analyzed. For XTH phylogenies to have a predictive power, an emerging picture is that finer considerations of clade and subclade groupings should be made, based on both high-level sequence clustering algorithms and rigorous biochemical analysis (Baumann et al., 2007; Atkinson et al., 2009).As a case in point, historical group III (Campbell and Braam, 1999a) can be divided in two, supported by both sequence analysis and catalytic measurements. The archetypal XEH, TmNXG1 from nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) and VaXGH from azuki bean (Vigna angularis) of group III-A (group nomenclature according to Baumann et al., 2007), are thus far the only XTH gene products with demonstrable hydrolytic (XEH) activity (Edwards et al., 1986; Fanutti et al., 1993, 1996; Tabuchi et al., 2001; Baumann et al., 2007). In contrast, heterologously expressed XTH genes in group III-B, AtXTH27 (Campbell and Braam, 1999b), SlXTH5 (Saladie et al., 2006), and HvXTH8 (Kaewthai et al., 2010), show predominantly or exclusively XET activity, thus validating a functional distinction between the A and B clades.As a result of the 17 publicly available land plant genomes (http://www.phytozome.org/), the outlines of XTH gene product family evolution can be visualized (Fig. 1B). Xyloglucan and XTH genes are not present in all plants. The unicellular green algae of the division Chlorophyta are not likely to contain xyloglucan (Frei and Preston, 1961), and three available genome sequences reveal that these organisms do not possess XTH genes (Fig. 1B). In other green algal species more closely related to land plants, both XET activity and GH16 enzymes have been found, despite apparent lack of xyloglucan in their cell walls (Popper and Fry, 2003). For example, in Chara vulgaris, one of the closest living relatives to the early land plants, a transcript with high sequence similarity to GH16 β-1,3;1,4-glucanases has been found (Van Sandt et al., 2007a). It is tempting to speculate that such a sequence might be the ancestor of an early XTH gene, due to the similarities between GH16 β-1,3;1,4-glucanases and XTH gene products (Fig. 1A).The oldest plants currently known to have both xyloglucan (Popper and Fry, 2003; Popper, 2008) and XTH genes are the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens and the early vascular plants (lycophytes) Selaginella kraussiana (Van Sandt et al., 2006) and Selaginella moellendorffii. The relative abundance of XTH gene products in the genomes of P. patens and S. moellendorffii (Fig. 1B) indicate that group I is likely to be the original XTH gene product subfamily and that groups II and III-B arose subsequently in separate events. Particularly notable in these early plants is the lack of group III-A, which harbors the predominant XEH enzymes TmNXG1 and VaXGH (Fig. 1B). These observations are in accordance with Baumann et al. (2007), who suggested that XEH activity may have developed as a gain of function in an ancestral XET and also that an “ancestral group” of sequences (part of group I) clustered closest to a bacterial β-1,3;1,4-glucanase.A key outstanding question in the functional genomics of XTH genes is, what determines whether a protein will have XET or XEH activity, or some combination of the two? In 2004, the first experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of a XET was reported (Johansson et al., 2004), that of the Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides (hybrid aspen) XET16-34 (Protein Data Bank identifier [PDB ID] 1un1), which opened the door to addressing this question through “structural biology.” PttXET16-34, a member of group I/II that is highly up-regulated in wood-forming tissues, is notably devoid of measurable hydrolytic activity across a range of xyloglucan concentrations (Kallas et al., 2005; Baumann et al., 2007). Shortly thereafter, this first XET structure was followed by the structure of the archetypal XEH from nasturtium, TmNXG1 of group III-A (PDB ID 2uwa; Baumann et al., 2007). Together, these two structures were instrumental in providing the first atomic-level insight into the molecular mechanisms of cell wall remodeling and degradation by XTH gene products.Both the PttXET16-34 and TmNXG1 structures display the β-jellyroll fold common to all members of GH16, but with notable differences that reflect the specialization of these enzymes toward their highly branched substrate. Compared with the GH16 β-1,3;1,4-glucanases, which hydrolyze unsubstituted polyglucose chains (Planas, 2000), the XETs and XEHs have a much wider substrate-binding cleft due to a major loop deletion in the negative subsites of the active-site cleft (Fig. 2, compare A and B). (The negative subsites are those that bind the polysaccharide from the point of cleavage toward the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide, according to the nomenclature of Davies et al. [1997]). In the positive subsites, a C-terminal extension, which has been long recognized as a distinguishing feature of XET sequences in GH16 (Campbell and Braam, 1999a; InterPro entry IPR010713), elongates the substrate-binding cleft by providing an extra β-strand at the end of an α-helix (Fig. 2C; Johansson et al., 2004). Strikingly, this motif follows a disorganized leader sequence extending across the underside of the tertiary structure (Fig. 2C), which may present a hurdle in protein folding that contributes to the difficulties encountered in the recombinant production of these enzymes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts (Kaewthai et al., 2010).Structures of XTH gene products and a closely related GH16 β-1,3;1,4-glucanase.

[2009]). B, Surface representation of a β-1,3;1,4-glucanase in silver, with the loop narrowing the negative subsites in copper (PDB ID 1u0a).

D, Overlay of a XET, PttXET16-34 (silver with red loops), and an XEH, TmNXG1 (gold with blue loops; PDB ID 2uwa, 2vh9).The experimentally determined PttXET16-34 (Johansson et al., 2004) and TmNXG1 (Baumann et al., 2007) tertiary structures also reveal the structural importance of highly conserved Cys residues (Campbell and Braam, 1999a), which help to stabilize the C-terminal extension by the formation of two disulfide bonds. Finally, the PttXET16-34 structure highlights the structural importance of the N-glycan, the core of which interacts tightly with the polypeptide chain (Johansson et al., 2004). Removal of this N-glycan, either through site-directed mutagenesis or enzymatic treatment, greatly reduces proper protein folding and stability in a number of XETs (Campbell and Braam, 1999b; Kallas et al., 2005, and refs. therein). This N-glycosylation site is conserved in all group I/II sequences but is notably absent in nearly all group III-A enzymes such as TmNXG1 (Baumann et al., 2007). In group III-B enzymes, the N-glycosylation site is shifted toward the C terminus, thus placing it on the other side of the active-site cleft (Kallas et al., 2005).Although the inclusion of XETs in a GH family may seem incongruous, the ability of XETs to catalyze transglycosylation is a logical consequence of the canonical “retaining” catalytic mechanism employed by all members of GH16 (Planas, 2000). A key feature of the retaining mechanism (Fig. 3) is the formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, which can be broken down by water, yielding hydrolysis (XEH activity), or an incoming saccharide substrate, yielding transglycosylation (XET activity; Planas, 2000; Gilbert et al., 2008). Definitive proof of the covalent nature of the glycosyl-enzyme has been obtained through kinetic trapping and direct observation of this intermediate in PttXET16-34 by mass spectrometry (Piens et al., 2008).A schematic representation of the mechanism used by XETs and XEHs. Left, xyloglucan binds to XETs and XEHs in both negative and positive subsites (glucosyl units of xyloglucan in blue and xylosyl units in orange; subsite nomenclature of Davies et al. [1997]). After binding, the substrate is cleaved, resulting in a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (bond indicated in red). Right, in the last step, the glycosyl-enzyme is broken down by an incoming acceptor, either water (XEH activity) or the nonreducing end of a xyloglucan molecule (XET activity).The catalytic motif in all XTH gene products is 83(H/W/R)-(D/N)-E-(I/L/F/V)-D-(F/I/L/M)-E-(F/L)-(L/M)-G92 (catalytic residues in boldface, most frequent amino acids underlined; PttXET16-34 numbering). The first Glu (Glu-85 in PttXET16-34) is known as the “catalytic nucleophile,” which attacks the anomeric carbon of the Glc ring in subsite −1 to yield the glycosyl-enzyme in the first step of the catalytic reaction. Glu-89 functions alternately as a catalytic general acid to protonate the xyloglucan chain fragment departing the positive subsites and as a catalytic general base to activate the incoming acceptor substrate (water, xyloglucan, or xyloglucan oligosaccharide). The specific role of Asp-87, which lies on the same face of the β-strand as Glu-85 and Glu-89 (Fig. 2C, highlighted in green), is currently unknown, although hydrogen-bonding patterns (Johansson et al., 2004; Mark et al., 2009) suggest that this residue might modulate the ionization state of the catalytic nucleophile, as has been suggested previously for other GH16 enzymes (Planas, 2000).The identities of these catalytic residues, conserved in all GH16 enzymes, are known from elegant mutagenesis, kinetic, and structural studies on bacterial endo-glucanases (for review, see Planas, 2000; Eklöf, 2010). Indeed, the catalytic residues in the ExDxE motif of Bacillus species endo-glucanases are exactly superimposable onto those of both PttXET16-34 and TmNXG1 (Johansson et al., 2004; Baumann et al., 2007). Confirmation of the identity of the catalytic nucleophile in GH16 XETs and XEHs comes from the observation that mutation of the corresponding Glu in both PttXET16-34 and TmNXG1 results in the complete loss of the wild-type activity; these nucleophile variants are nonetheless able to perform “glycosynthase” reactions (i.e. the resynthesis of xyloglucans from artificial donor substrates [α-fluoroglycosides of xyloglucan oligosaccharides]; Piens et al., 2007; Gullfot et al., 2009). Furthermore, mutation of Glu-85 in PttXET16-34 to Ala prevents formation of the covalent glycosyl-enzyme (Piens et al., 2008). The hydrophobic side chains of the intervening residues in the catalytic motif do not play a direct role in catalysis, as these point into the interior of the β-jellyroll structure, where they fulfill a structural function.Initial comparisons of the PttXET16-34 structure with the Bacillus species β-1,3;1,4-glucanase in fact revealed very little about the determinants of transglycosylation versus hydrolysis in XTH gene products, due to the exact superposition of many key active-site residues (Johansson et al., 2004). The stability of the PttXET16-34 glycosyl-enzyme to hydrolysis in dilute aqueous solution (56 m water) is indeed remarkable: kinetic trapping studies placed the hydrolytic half-life of this intermediate at approximately 3 h (khydr = 0.005 min−1) in the complete absence of a xyloglucan acceptor substrate (which could not occur in vivo), while the addition of xyloglucan oligosaccharides rapidly turned over the glycosyl enzyme (in less than 2 min; Piens et al., 2008). This behavior stands in stark contrast to the measured hydrolytic rate of TmNXG1 on tamarind (Tamarindus indica) xyloglucan (apparent kcat = 5.5 min−1), whose glycosyl-enzyme is thus rapidly broken down by water (Baumann et al., 2007). The three-dimensional structures of these two enzymes revealed that much of this difference in catalytic properties is the result of subtle variations in active-site loop structures, as follows.Overall, the structures of PttXET16-34 and the archetypal XEH TmNXG1, as indicated by superposition of their backbone Cα traces, are very similar. The obvious differences between these enzymes lay in two loops lining one side of the substrate-binding cleft: loop 1 lines the −1 and −2 subsites, while loop 2 lines the +1 and +2 subsites (Fig. 2D). A three-amino acid insertion in loop 1 is common to members of both group III-A and III-B, relative to group I/II members, while the length of the insertion in loop 2 varies between group III-A and III-B: group III-B possess a two-amino acid insert (Xaa-Gly) in loop 2 compared with group I/II, while this insert in group III-A is five amino acids long, with the consensus sequence (Gly/Arg)-Asn-Ile-Ile-Gly.The importance of the length of loop 2 in tuning the balance between XET and XEH activity was demonstrated through the generation of a chimeric enzyme, TmNXG1-ΔYNIIG (Baumann et al., 2007). This chimera, in which the shorter loop 2 of the PttXET16-34 was presented on the TmNXG1 scaffold (PDB ID 2uwb), showed intermediate kinetics: with respect to the TmNXG1 wild type, XEH activity was reduced 2-fold, while XET activity was doubled to reach half that of PttXET16-34 at saturating substrate conditions (Baumann et al., 2007). Thus, while loop 2 is one of the important determinants for hydrolysis versus transglycosylation, there are clearly also other yet unidentified factors governing the fate of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. In particular, further protein engineering studies are needed to completely remove the hydrolytic capacity of the TmNXG1 protein scaffold, thereby converting it into a strict (or overwhelmingly predominant) XET.Molecular dynamics simulations based on crystallographic complexes of PttXET16-34 and TmNXG1 with xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Mark et al., 2009) and kinetic measurements (Saura-Valls et al., 2008) indicate that PttXET16-34 may bind xyloglucan substrates more tightly in the positive subsites, while TmNXG1 binds these substrates more strongly in the negative subsites. Small changes in protein-substrate interactions, together with subtle changes in protein dynamics, are thus likely to be additional contributors affecting XET versus XEH activity. Indeed, there are certain parallels to be explored between xyloglucan activity in GH16 and the diverse starch hydrolases and transglycosylases (van der Maarel et al., 2002). These include the potential of induced-fit mechanisms to properly orient the active-site residues and conformational changes to effect leaving group departure and acceptor substrate binding (Uitdehaag et al., 2000).In addition to possessing a wide active-site cleft, which is capable of accommodating brush-like xyloglucan chains (Fig. 2), GH16 XETs and XEHs have a number of structural features that form specific interactions with the polysaccharide to bring it “in register” for cleavage by the catalytic amino acids. Ligand structures of PttXET16-34 with substrate bound in the positive subsites (PDB ID 1umz) and TmNXG1 with substrate bound in the negative subsites (PDB ID 2vh9) provide visual evidence that XTH gene products have a 35-Å-long active-site cleft, composed of primary subsites for seven backbone glucosyl units (−4 to +3; Fig. 2, A and C; Mark et al., 2009). The glucan backbone binds tightly in the cleft, primarily through hydrophobic stacking interactions in the −3 to +2 subsites (Trp-19, Trp-174, Trp-179, and Tyr-75; PttXET16-34 numbering). Composite models from molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the unbranched glucosyl unit in the −1 subsite is forced into a strained skew-boat configuration in the enzyme-substrate complex (Mark et al., 2009) as a prerequisite for catalysis (Davies et al., 1998).While structural and modeling data reveal that XETs and XEHs have seven primary subsites, it has been shown that longer substrates give a slight increase in transglycosylation rate (Purugganan et al., 1997; Saura-Valls et al., 2008), corresponding to a transition state binding energy of only 0.5 kcal mol−1 for XXXG3 versus XXXG2 (Saura-Valls et al., 2008) This increase cannot be accounted for by direct enzyme-substrate interactions and may be due to entropic reasons (i.e. better ordering of sugar residues near the ends of the active-site cleft in longer substrates). Nonetheless, it should be clarified that, contrary to earlier suggestions (Rose et al., 2002), there is no firm evidence to suggest that GH16 XETs and XEHs generally require substrates longer than the minimal donor XXXGXXXG (Tabuchi et al., 1997; Baumann et al., 2007; Ibatullin et al., 2008).The effect of branching substitutions on the xyloglucan backbone on the interaction of PttXET16-34 with its substrate has been assessed using a library of 18 synthetic xylogluco-oligosaccharides (Saura-Valls et al., 2008). The design and generation of this library alone was a tour de force in carbohydrate synthesis (Faure et al., 2006), as was the determination of full kinetic parameters (kcat and Km values) for nearly all substrates under initial rate conditions (Saura-Valls et al., 2006, 2008). The assay employed a highly sensitive capillary electrophoresis method to analyze the products from the XET-catalyzed glycosyl transfer from donor substrates onto a fluorescent 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS)-labeled acceptor substrate: XXXGXXXG (donor) + XXXG-ANTS (acceptor) → XXXGXXXG-ANTS + XXXG. Variation of the donor backbone length and the pattern of α-1,6-Xyl substitution allowed elucidation of the specific contribution of individual glycosyl units to transition state stabilization (ΔΔG‡) in the substrate-binding cleft of PttXET16-34.Interestingly, the singular influence of many α-1,6-xylosyl units is small: Xyl substitution of the glucosyl units in subsites −4, −3, −2, +1, and +3 (Fig. 2, A and C) affected the specificity parameter kcat/Km by a factor of 2 or less, which equates to less than 0.5 kcal mol−1 transition-state stabilization (see Schemes 4–6 in Saura-Valls et al. [2008]). The xylosyl unit in the +2′ subsite [i.e. attached to Glc(+2)], however, is crucial to activity, contributing approximately 4 kcal mol−1 to catalysis, which equates to an increase in the kcat/Km (rate) value of more than 500-fold over substrates lacking this residue (Saura-Valls et al., 2008). The obvious importance of Xyl(2′) reflects earlier studies on TmNXG1 from group III-A (Fanutti et al., 1996) and XET preparations extracted from pea (Pisum sativum; Fry et al., 1992; Lorences and Fry, 1993), thus highlighting that Xyl(2′) recognition is a major specificity determinant common to both XETs and XEHs of GH16. Interestingly, despite species- and tissue-dependent heterogeneities in xyloglucan side chain decorations, a xylosyl unit is always present two glycosyl units after an unsubstituted glucosyl unit (Hoffman et al., 2005; Hsieh and Harris, 2009). And while Xyl(2′) clearly dominates in the xyloglucan-XET interaction, it should be borne in mind that the additive effects of several xylosyl units on the glucan backbone are ultimately responsible for xyloglucan specificity in both the positive and negative subsites of XTH gene products.Due to the complexities of obtaining pure donor substrates with further specific side chain elaboration, the contributions of pendant galactosyl, fucosyl, and arabinosyl units has not been examined to the same extent as xylosylation. In a few cases, galactosylation and (fuco)galactosylation have also been shown to influence XET activity, but to a limited extent (Fry et al., 1992; Lorences and Fry, 1993; Maris et al., 2009). For example, substrate competition assays of a pea XET preparation indicated an acceptor preference of XLLG > XXXG > XXLG, although the difference in catalytic rates between the best and least good substrates was approximately 2-fold (Fry et al., 1992), again reflecting a minimal contribution to transition state binding. Interestingly, a very crude protein preparation from Arabidopsis showed reduced XET activity on xyloglucan extracted from mur3 plants, which contains only XXXG repeats lacking galactosyl and (fuco)galactosyl side chains (Pena et al., 2004). As with the pea XET study, however, the analysis of unpurified enzyme mixtures requires that these results be interpreted with some caution. In the archetypal XEH, TmNXG1, the presence of galactosylation had little to no effect on the rate of hydrolysis when comparing XXXG- versus XLLG-based substrates. In contrast, xylosylation (comparing GGGG and XXXG substrates) boosted specificity (kcat/Km) over 2 orders of magnitude (Ibatullin et al., 2008).These specificity data can be nicely mapped onto the experimental three-dimensional structures of XET and XEH active sites (Mark et al., 2009). As a specific example, the +2′ Xyl-binding subsite discussed above is a hydrophobic pocket composed of a Tyr and two Arg side chains (Arg-116, Tyr-250, and Arg-258 in PttXET16-34). The C-terminal extension, unique to the XTH gene products, comprises two-thirds of this hydrophobic pocket by contributing with the strictly conserved Tyr-250 and Arg-258 (Fig. 2, A and C; for full structural details, see Mark et al. [2009]). The third amino acid in the hydrophobic pocket, Arg-116, is conserved within groups I and III, whereas in group II, Arg-116 is replaced by a Gln; the functional significance of this change, if any, is currently unknown. As is typical for carbohydrate active enzymes and binding modules, XTH gene products employ a multitude of hydrophobic ring-stacking interactions and hydrogen bonds with sugar hydroxyl groups to recognize and bind their substrates. A complete survey of all active-site interactions, however, is both challenging and tedious (Mark et al., 2009): the minimal substrate XXXGXXXG spanning the active site is composed of 14 monosaccharide units, presenting a remarkable 38 hydroxyl groups and 28 glycosidic and ring oxygens, each with two to three hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor sites each!The grassy species of the order Poales have cell walls with relatively low amounts of xyloglucan compared with the dicotyledons (Fincher, 2009; Hsieh and Harris, 2009). Despite this, the XTH genes of all angiosperms are of similar size (Fig. 1B), and XTH gene transcripts in the Poales species Hordeum vulgare (barley) are abundant in cell wall-remodeling libraries (Strohmeier et al., 2004). Work by Hrmova, Fincher, and coworkers has shown that a pure barley XET has the quantifiable ability to conjugate xyloglucan with other β-glucans (Hrmova et al., 2007). Thus, HvXET6 was able to use the substrate donor/acceptor pairs xyloglucan/cello-oligosaccharides and β-1,3:1,4-glucan/xyloglucan-oligosaccharides at rates of 0.1% and 0.2% of the wild-type (xyloglucan/xyloglucan-oligosaccharides) activity, respectively. The enzyme was also able to use hydroxyethylcellulose and sulfuric acid-swollen cellulose as glycosyl donors, with xyloglucan-oligosaccharide acceptors at 44% and 5% of the wild-type rate, respectively. These observations prompted the proposition that XTH isoforms may build xyloglucan-(β-1,3:1,4-glucan) links that fortify the cell wall in grass species (Hrmova et al., 2007). Given the comparatively low activities observed for heterotransglycosylation, supporting this hypothesis with in vivo data may present a significant experimental challenge.Low-level heterotransglycosylation activities may, in fact, be a general feature of XTH gene products, due to inherent active-site promiscuity. Work preceding the study described above detected xyloglucan/β-glucan conjugation activity in crude extracts from germinating nasturtium seeds (Mohand and Farkas, 2006). Although the enzyme responsible for this activity was not identified, later studies indicated that pure nasturtium TmNXG1 could use cello-oligosaccharide acceptors to generate preparative amounts of xyloglucan conjugates (Baumann et al., 2007). Likewise, the subsite-mapping studies described above showed that PttXET16-34 could use both GGGG•XXXG and XXXG•GGGG (and shorter congeners) as glycosyl donors (where • indicates the point of cleavage), thus indicating that xylosylation is not an absolute requirement for activity (Saura-Valls et al., 2008). Indeed, the selectivity (kcat/Km value) for XXXG•GGGG was approximately 0.1% of the value of the “wild-type” substrate XXXG•XXXG, which mirrors the results described above for HvXET6, while that for GGGG•XXXG was 65% of the XXXG•XXXG value. Furthermore, on the basis of experimental structural data (Johansson et al., 2004; Baumann et al., 2007; Mark et al., 2009), there is no steric reason why XETs and XEHs would exclude skinnier substrates from their active-site clefts, although the loss of Xyl side chain binding, especially Xyl(+2′), would be expected to penalize catalysis, as described above.Notably, C-6 oxidation of xyloglucan backbone Glc residues to glucuronyl residues using the reagent TEMPO destroys the ability of the polysaccharide to act as a donor substrate in the first step of the XET reaction (Fig. 3; Takeda et al., 2008). Structural analysis indicates that the presence of a uronic acid may disrupt hydrogen-bonding patterns implicit in binding the donor substrate and forcing it into a skew-boat conformation in the Michaelis (E•S) complex (Mark et al., 2009). The observation that TEMPO-oxidized xyloglucans retain the ability to act as glycosyl acceptors is rationalized by the observation that Glc(+4) extends beyond the end of the active-site cleft (Johansson et al., 2004).An enzyme activity equivalent to one proposed for barley HvXET6 (i.e. mixed-linkage β-glucan:xyloglucan endo-transglucosylase [MXE]) has been found in Equisetum species (horsetails) as well as in the closest living ancestors of land plants, the Charophyta (Fry et al., 2008). MXG activity in the species tested was indeed significant, in some cases reaching equivalent values for XET activity in crude extracts. In contrast, MXE activity was deemed negligible in a range of land plants tested, including a selection of bryophytes, pteridophytes, angiosperms, and a lycopodiophyte. For example, an extract of local Yorkshire fog grass (Holcus lanatus) exhibited a relative MXG:XET activity ratio of 0.17% (Fry et al., 2008), similar to HvXET6 from barley (Hrmova et al., 2009), also a member of the order Poales.A series of biochemical arguments have been put forth to suggest that the observed MXE activity is not due to an XTH gene product. However, definitive proof, as well as the possibility to engineer this activity into cereal crops to improve cell wall properties (Fry et al., 2008), will have to await the cloning and heterologous expression of the gene encoding this activity as well as full kinetic characterization of the recombinant enzyme. Cautious optimism is warranted, since similar enzyme discovery experiments using specific transglycosylation assays have identified “microbial XETs,” which have later turned out to be predominant (xylo)glucan endo-hydrolases (Nielsen, 1998). Indeed, any number of endo-β-glucanases employing the canonical retaining mechanism could possess MXE side activity, although the low apparent Km value (4 μm) for the alditol acceptor substrate XXXGol certainly speaks for the existence of a specific enzyme (Fry et al., 2008). If not an XTH gene product or another GH16 enzyme, it will be interesting to see if this enzyme belongs to GH family 17 [which includes β-1,3(4)-endo-glucanases; Varghese et al., 1994), another endo-glucanase family (Gilbert et al., 2008), or eventually defines a new CAZy family (Cantarel et al., 2009).The idea that transglycosylases could play a key role in primary cell wall extension was first articulated in the mid 1970s (Albersheim, 1976). Since that time, XETs have received by far the most attention in this respect, although, as highlighted above, other activities are beginning to be explored. In particular, the potential for transglycosylation has been revealed in a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) endo-β-mannanase (Schröder et al., 2009) from GH family 5, members of which use the canonical retaining mechanism (Gilbert et al., 2008). Indeed, the transglycosylation potential of GH5 enzymes has been long known (Harjunpää et al., 1999), although a full structural and kinetic analysis is sorely needed to highlight key active-site features (Bourgault et al., 2005) that might allow functional prediction based on sequence phylogeny.It is noteworthy that surveys of available plant genomes reveal many families of retaining GHs (Henrissat et al., 2001; Geisler-Lee et al., 2006), the numerous members of which all have the implicit potential to catalyze transglycosylation reactions (Sinnott, 1990). Taking Arabidopsis as an example, 23 GH families use the retaining mechanism (http://www.cazy.org/Genomes.html). Of these, 15 GH families are likely to contain exo-acting enzymes, which remove terminal monosaccharide units. Discounting predicted starch- and chitin-cleaving enzymes, four known retaining GH families contain demonstrated endo-polysaccharidases: GH5 (mannanases, glucanases, galactanases), GH10 (xylanases), GH16 (xyloglucanases), and GH17 (β-1,3 glucanases). In contrast, for example, the 25 GH9 members (predicted endo-glucanases; Urbanowicz et al., 2007) and 67 GH28 members (predicted galacturonidases) from Arabidopsis utilize the inverting glycosidase mechanism, which only allows polysaccharide hydrolysis (Sinnott, 1990). It will be interesting to see if future functional studies uncover new CAZy families in plants with polysaccharide rearrangement activities.The relation of in vitro enzyme kinetics and structure-function studies to effects in vivo can be a powerful tool in functional genomics studies, although such extrapolations are sometimes viewed with skepticism. It is, however, arguably better to know as many details of catalysis as possible when postulating the effect of an enzyme on plant physiology, and this is certainly true in the case of the disparate activities of polysaccharide hydrolysis and transglycosylation. For example, a XET that does not measurably hydrolyze xyloglucan in in vitro assays containing 56 m water (Supplemental Table S1) is unlikely to do so in the hydrogel matrix of the cell wall, where the water activity may be even lower. Likewise, the observation that TmNXG1 is hydrolytically inefficient (Ibatullin et al., 2008) and only transglycosylates at very high xyloglucan oligosaccharide concentrations (Baumann et al., 2007) might imply a product inhibition/feedback mechanism during seed germination.Such relationships, however, require careful quantitation of kinetic rates across a range of substrate concentrations. Where possible, competing reactions, such as hydrolysis and transglycosylation, should be measured directly in a single assay mixture (Harjunpää et al., 1999; Baumann et al., 2007). Comparatively insensitive and semiquantitative assays, such as those based on viscometry, should be avoided in favor of strictly quantitative assays that yield true catalytic turnover numbers, such as radiometric and fluorometric assays of transglycosylation (Fry et al., 1992; Saura-Valls et al., 2006; Hrmova et al., 2007) and reducing sugar assays of hydrolysis (Kallas et al., 2005; Hrmova et al., 2009). “Chemical biology” can also play a key role in coupling fundamental enzymology with phenotypic and functional genomics studies: in situ fluorescence assays are currently available for both XET (Vissenberg et al., 2000) and XEH (Ibatullin et al., 2009) activity, and similar methodology has recently been used to examine plant GH9 endo-glucanase (KORRIGAN1 homolog) overexpression in vivo (Takahashi et al., 2009).Although significant insight has been gleaned through enzyme structure-function analyses, a complete understanding of the determinants of transglycosylation versus hydrolysis in the xyloglucan-active enzymes of GH16 is unfortunately still lacking. Further elucidation will require both mapping activities onto XTH sequence diversity through rigorous biochemical characterization of enzymes produced in heterologous hosts (to avoid uncertainty due to potential contaminating isozymes from native sources) and continued protein engineering studies. The XTH genes have certainly not revealed all of their family secrets, despite continued prying into their evolutionary history and current activities. In the coming years, we look forward to the continued convergence of biochemical, protein structural, and physiological studies of these curious enzymes.The following materials are available in the online version of this article.Supplemental Table S1.

PMC2879803,Biosynthesis of Pectin1,False,"The plant cell wall is composed of polysaccharides and proteins. In addition, some cells have walls impregnated with lignin. In all cases, the polysaccharides constitute the major part of the wall. The wall polysaccharides are often classified into cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectin, and these three types are represented in almost all cell walls in varying proportions. Cellulose is the main load-bearing structure and is composed of β-1,4-linked glucan chains organized in more or less crystalline microfibrils. Hemicelluloses include several different polymers, chiefly xylans, xyloglucans, and (gluco)mannans, which are characterized by having a backbone of β-1,4-linked sugars with an equatorial linkage configuration (Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010). Pectin is the third group of polysaccharides, characterized by relatively high extractability using acid or chelators and a high content of GalUA. Together, the hemicelluloses and pectins constitute the matrix in which cellulose microfibrils are embedded. The interactions between the different polysaccharides ensure the strong yet dynamic and flexible properties of the cell wall.Various pectic polysaccharides can be detected in the cell wall, including homogalacturonan (HG), xylogalacturonan (XGA), apiogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI), and rhamnogalacturonan II (RGII; Fig. 1). In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves, the cell wall contains approximately 50% (w/w) pectin but the content varies depending on environment, tissue, and species (Zablackis et al., 1995). The ratio between HG, XGA, RGI, and RGII is also variable, but typically HG is the most abundant polysaccharide, constituting about 65% of the pectin, while RGI constitutes 20% to 35% (Mohnen, 2008). XGA and RGII are minor components, each constituting less than 10% (Zandleven et al., 2007; Mohnen, 2008). The different pectic polysaccharides are not separate molecules but covalently linked domains. Unbranched homopolymer chains of α-1,4-linked d-GalUA are described as HG. The backbone of GalUA residues can be substituted at various positions with other sugar moieties, including Xyl (XGA) and apiofuranose (apiogalacturonan). In XGA, a single Xyl is attached to the O-3 position of some GalUA residues. Additional Xyl residues can be attached to the first Xyl with β-1,4 linkage (Zandleven et al., 2006). XGA is particularly abundant in reproductive tissues but is also present in other tissues, such as Arabidopsis leaves (Zandleven et al., 2007). In aquatic angiosperms such as Lemna and Spirodela, the galacturonan backbone is decorated with d-apiofuranose at O-2 or O-3 (Hart and Kindel, 1970; Ovodov et al., 1971; Longland et al., 1989).Schematic structure of pectin. Pectin consists of four different types of polysaccharides, and their structures are shown. Kdo, 3-Deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid; DHA, 3-deoxy-d-lyxo-2-heptulosaric acid. HG and RGI are much more abundant than the other components (see text).Besides the simple substitutions in XGA and apiogalacturonan, clusters of complex side chains are also attached onto the O-2 or O-3 position in the galacturonan backbone to form RGII (Fig. 1). These side chains are composed of 12 types of glycosyl residues linked together by at least 22 different glycosidic bonds. Some of the glycosyl residues and glycosidic linkages found in RGII side chains are rare and considered unique in plant polysaccharides (e.g. 2-O-methyl-l-Fuc, l-aceric acid, and α-1,3- xylofuranose). Despite its complexity, the structure of RGII is highly conserved among vascular plants (Matsunaga et al., 2004; O'Neill et al., 2004). Frequently, RGII exists as a dimer mediated by borate ion attached to the A branch. Boron is an essential micronutrient for plants, most likely due to an important role of RGII dimerization in ensuring the integrity of the cell wall (O'Neill et al., 2001). Thus, although RGII is a minor component of pectin, it seems to have an essential role, and that may be the main reason why very few mutants with altered RGII have been identified, although many genes must be involved in RGII biosynthesis.RGI is the only type of pectin not built upon pure galacturonan backbones. Instead, it is a branched polymer with a backbone of disaccharide (α-1,4-d-GalA-α-1,2-l-Rha) repeats. The Rha residues in the backbone can be substituted with β-1,4-galactan, branched arabinan, and/or arabinogalactan side chains. Unlike RGII, the structure of the side chains of RGI can vary greatly among plants. Even a model suggesting that HG and its substituted variants are side chains of RGI was proposed (Vincken et al., 2003). However, the discovery of RGI backbone oligomers with HG and XGA as nonreducing end extensions suggests otherwise (Nakamura et al., 2002; Coenen et al., 2008).Galacturonic acid in pure galacturonan backbones is further modified by methyl esterification at the C-6 carboxyl position and/or by O-acetylation at the O-2 or O-3 position, whereas, in RGI, only the O-3 acetylation has been unambiguously reported (Komalavilas and Mort, 1989; Ishii, 1995, 1997). The degree of methyl and acetyl esterification is variable and affects the physicochemical properties of the pectin, especially the formation of calcium-mediated interactions between HG chains. For example, the dimerization of homopolygalacturonan chains mediated by calcium ions was found to require stretches of at least nine unmodified GalUA residues and could be disrupted by methyl esterification (Liners et al., 1992).The primary roles of cell walls are to give physical strength to the plant and to provide a barrier against the outside environment. The main role of pectin is to participate in these two functions together with the other polymers. Especially HG and RGII are well known to be involved in strengthening the wall. The mechanical properties of HG and RGII have been reviewed and described thoroughly in other publications (Ryden et al., 2003; Caffall and Mohnen, 2009) and will not be described further here. HG plays additional roles besides pure mechanical support. Plant pathogens cause degradation of pectin, and oligogalacturonides (i.e. α-1,4-linked oligomers of GalUA) are well established to be part of a signaling cascade that senses wall degradation upon pathogen attack (Ridley et al., 2001; D'Ovidio et al., 2004; Kohorn et al., 2009).Compared with the many studies of HG and RGII function, much less is known about the function of RGI, and it has not been summarized in recent reviews. Treatment of leaf epidermis with arabinanase resulted in hindering of the opening and closing of the stomata (Jones et al., 2003). The proposed hypothesis is that the arabinans work as spatial regulators of the proximity of HG domains. This regulation may prevent the formation of Ca2+-mediated interactions between HG regions; hence, the removal of arabinan may induce stiffening of the cell wall. This hypothesis of the RGI side chains as plasticizers in cell walls that undergo large physical remodeling is in agreement with observations of cell walls functioning under extreme water deficient conditions. Arabinan and galactan are highly mobile polymers compared with the other components of pectin, and this mobility is influenced by the hydration of the cell wall. Therefore, arabinan and galactan are the first polymers to be mobilized upon the hydration of dry cell walls (Tang et al., 1999). Likewise, arabinan and galactan retain mobility relatively longer than other cell wall polymers upon desiccation and may fill the cavities created upon physical rearrangement of the cell wall. Interestingly, an unusually high Ara content (approximately 38 mol %) was observed in the resurrection plant Myrothamnus flabellifolius and inferred to represent pectic arabinan (Moore et al., 2006). Seeds also undergo extreme desiccation and may have a high content of arabinans (Shiga and Lajolo, 2006; Gomez et al., 2009). Marama bean (Tylosema esculentum), a native bean from southern Africa with a water content down to 5%, has as much as 60% (w/w) Ara in the noncellulosic fraction of the cell wall, practically all from a highly branched arabinan (M. Mosele and J. Harholt, unpublished data). Further evidence for the role of RGI side chains in the physical properties of the wall comes from the investigation of transgenic plants. Ulvskov et al. (2005) analyzed the mechanical properties of the cell wall of potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers from wild-type and transformant plants with decreased contents of galactan or arabinan. The force needed to induce failure of the cell wall decreased in both types of transgenic tubers. The elastic properties of the tubers were also altered, with a stiffening of the cell wall, as observed in stomatal cells (Jones et al., 2003; Ulvskov et al., 2005). Overall, the data lead us to propose that the components of RGI transmit stresses in the wall and hence play a direct role in wall rheology.Several cell wall polymers function as storage polymers that are mobilized during seed germination. While mostly hemicelluloses have this role, components of pectin may also serve as storage compounds. Galactan is highly abundant in the cotyledons of certain lupin (Lupinus) species (Hirst et al., 1947) and is remobilized during seed germination (Crawshaw and Reid, 1984). Recently, it was shown that polymers containing LM6 epitopes, plausibly arabinan, are remobilized during Arabidopsis seed germination and influence germination negatively if removed before germination (Gomez et al., 2009). Arabidopsis seeds contain up to 40 mol % Ara in the noncellulosic cell wall fraction. The Ara was shown by pulse-chase experiments to be metabolized during germination. Hence, the arabinan in the seeds may have a storage function, but it also has a more direct role in seed germination, as it has been shown that arabinofuranosidase acting on arabinan has an important role in expelling of the seed mucilage upon seed hydration (Arsovski et al., 2009).Matrix polysaccharides are assumed to be synthesized in Golgi vesicles, even though it cannot be excluded that some initial steps take place in the endoplasmic reticulum or that some assembly steps take place in the wall. Nevertheless, the evidence for Golgi localization is strong. Several pectic biosynthetic activities have been shown to cofractionate with Golgi markers (Powell and Brew, 1974; Goubet and Mohnen, 1999; Sterling et al., 2001; Nunan and Scheller, 2003; Geshi et al., 2004), and pectic epitopes can be found in the Golgi vesicles but not in endoplasmic reticulum (Andeme-Onzighi et al., 2000). Furthermore, the few pectic biosynthetic enzymes that have been identified have all been shown to be located in the Golgi apparatus. Given the complexity of pectin structures, it is obvious that a large number of enzymes are required to synthesize these polysaccharides. With reasonable assumptions regarding the substrate specificity of the biosynthetic enzymes, Mohnen et al. (2008) have predicted that 67 different glycosyltransferases (GTs), methyltransferases, and acetyltransferases are required. As will be seen below, only three of these enzymes have been unambiguously identified. Pectin biosynthesis has been studied for many years, and HG biosynthesis in vitro was demonstrated already in 1965 (Villemez et al., 1965). Biosynthesis of arabinan and galactan was also demonstrated long ago (McNab et al., 1968; Odzuck and Kauss, 1972; Bolwell and Northcote, 1981). Thus, quite a lot is known about biosynthetic activities in plant tissues, but it is beyond the scope of this review to give a detailed treatise of these fundamental studies. Here, we will mainly focus on the studies that have led to identification of the genes and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pectin. For other recent reviews of pectin biosynthesis, see Mohnen (2008), Caffall and Mohnen (2009), and Liepman et al. (2010).As mentioned above, HG biosynthesis in vitro was reported already 45 years ago. Nevertheless, in spite of a considerable amount of work by different researchers, it took very long before any of the pectin biosynthetic enzymes were identified. A major contribution was the solubilization of the HG synthase from Nicotiana tabacum and the development of an acceptor-dependent assay for α-1,4-GalA transferase (Doong and Mohnen, 1998). The in vitro activity indicated that endogenous α-1,4-GalA transferase transfers GalA residues to the nonreducing end of the growing HG chain (Scheller et al., 1999). The work of Mohnen and coworkers ultimately enabled the first successful identification of a pectin biosynthetic enzyme, the HG α-1,4-GalA transferase identified in Arabidopsis by Sterling et al. (2006). The enzyme, designated GALACTURONOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (GAUT1), was expressed in human kidney cells and able to synthesize polygalacturonic acid in vitro. Interestingly, the enriched membrane fraction from Arabidopsis that contained GAUT1 also contained a homologous protein, GAUT7. GAUT7 has not been shown to have activity when expressed heterologously, but the two proteins interact with each other and form a complex in vivo (Mohnen, 2008). GAUT1 is predicted to be a type II membrane protein (i.e. a protein with a single N-terminal transmembrane helix and the main globular domain inside the Golgi lumen). GTs and other carbohydrate active enzymes are cataloged in the CAZy database (www.cazy.org; Cantarel et al., 2009). CAZy has 93 GT families, 42 of which are represented in angiosperms. The GAUT group of proteins belongs to CAZy GT family 8 and has 15 members in Arabidopsis (Fig. 2). One of the members, QUASIMODO1 (QUA1; GAUT8), was actually implicated in pectin biosynthesis prior to the identification of GAUT1 (Bouton et al., 2002). The qua1 mutant is highly deficient in HG, suggesting an involvement of QUA1 in pectin biosynthesis. However, the activity of QUA1 has not been reported, and although the qua1 mutant showed decreased activity of HG GalA transferase, it also showed decreased xylan synthase activity (Orfila et al., 2005). Several potential functions have been proposed for another member of the GAUT family, GAUT12 (also known as IRREGULAR XYLEM8 [IRX8]). Loss-of-function mutations in IRX8 result in decreased xylan content in the wall, especially a decrease in the reducing end oligosaccharide present in xylans of most plants (Pena et al., 2007). This had led to the suggestion that GAUT12 is involved in synthesizing the reducing end oligosaccharide (Pena et al., 2007). The oligosaccharide contains a GalUA residue linked to Xyl with an α-1,4 linkage, and it seems plausible that GAUT12 could synthesize this linkage. Since an obvious GAUT12/IRX8 ortholog is not present in rice (Oryza sativa; Fig. 2), an alternative hypothesis was proposed that GAUT12 plays an important role in glucuronoxylan biosynthesis that is specific to dicots (Persson et al., 2007; Caffall et al., 2009). The reducing end oligosaccharide that contains GalA has so far not been demonstrated in grasses; therefore, the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Until the biochemical activity of GAUT12 is clearly determined, it cannot even be excluded that the effect on xylan is pleiotropic. Hence, although it is possible that all GAUT proteins are GalA transferases, it is uncertain how many are involved in pectin biosynthesis. A recent paper by Caffall et al. (2009) provides an excellent overview of the possible functions of the different GAUT proteins in Arabidopsis based on phylogeny and phenotype of insertional mutants. However, redundancy between the individual GAUTs and pleiotropic effects in the mutants complicate the picture of assigning specific activity to each protein and, with the data available at present, to conclude on the individual GAUT activities.Phylogenetic tree of the GAUT subgroup of CAZy GT8. The tree contains sequences from Arabidopsis, rice, and P. patens. The tree was generated using Proml in the Phylip package.In vitro pectic arabinosyltransferase activity was reported as early as 1972 (Odzuck and Kauss, 1972). Later, the assays were refined using membrane preparations and verification of the product by specific enzymatic degradation (Bolwell and Northcote, 1981). As for the in vitro HG activity assays described above, the introduction of exogenous acceptors allowed a better characterization of the enzymes (Nunan and Scheller, 2003). This approach was further refined by Ishii et al. (2005a, 2005b), who used very sensitive assays with fluorescently labeled acceptor substrates and succeeded in showing transfer of Ara to both arabinan and galactan acceptors. In these studies by Scheller, Ishii, and others, UDP-l-arabinopyranose was used as substrate and Ara was incorporated into the products in the pyranose configuration. However, the Ara in pectic arabinan and galactan is almost exclusively in the furanose configuration. UDP- l-arabinofuranose is not commercially available, but it was eventually used as a substrate by Konishi et al. (2006), who were able to demonstrate efficient in vitro transfer of arabinofuranose onto arabino-oligosaccharides. It then became clear that plants have mutases that convert UDP-arabinopyranose to UDP-arabinofuranose. The mutase activity was purified and the protein identified (Konishi et al., 2007). Surprisingly, the mutase had no similarity to bacterial UDP-galactomutase but was found to be a protein previously known as Reversibly Glycosylated Protein (RGP) due to its reversible glycosylation with a variety of UDP-sugars (Langeveld et al., 2002; Drakakaki et al., 2006). RGP is a relatively abundant protein located exterior on the Golgi vesicles. Although RGP may have additional functions, its activity as a mutase is not in doubt, since the heterologously expressed rice protein had clear UDP-arabinomutase activity (Konishi et al., 2007, 2010).In vitro biosynthesis of galactan was reported in 1968 (McNab et al., 1968). The assays have been further developed with solubilization of the membranes and the use of exogenous acceptors (Geshi et al., 2000, 2002, 2004; Peugnet et al., 2001; Ishii et al., 2004). Activities were found in flax (Linum usitatissimum; Peugnet et al., 2001) and potato (Geshi et al., 2002) that could transfer Gal from UDP-Gal onto RGI acceptors, resulting in products that could be digested with galactosidase but not with endo-β-1,4-galactanase. The study of Geshi et al. (2002) showed activity only with acceptors consisting of RGI backbone with short galactan side chains, but not with RGI backbone without any Gal or with galacto-oligosaccharides. In contrast, Ishii et al. (2004) showed galactosyltransferase activity in mung bean (Vigna radiata) microsomes using galacto-oligosaccharides. Despite the successful efforts to develop sensitive galactan galactosyltransferase assays, none of the genes involved in the biosynthesis have been identified. Transgenic plants with a decreased content of galactan have been produced by ectopic expression of galactanase, indicating that the viability of galactan-deficient plants is not severely affected (Sorensen et al., 2000; Obro et al., 2009). β-1,4-Galactan constitutes a major part of Gal in primary walls, and galactan-deficient mutants should be readily identifiable in cell wall composition analyses. In our opinion, the lack of identified galactan biosynthetic mutants indicates redundancy both in the GTs that add the initial Gal residues to the RGI backbone and in the GTs that elongate the galactan chain.In spite of the substantial number of biochemical studies of arabinan and galactan biosynthesis, the knowledge of the specific GTs involved in the biosynthesis of RGI and substituted HGs is sparse. Only two GTs have been published and positively identified as involved in RGI biosynthesis, namely ARABINAN DEFICIENT1 (ARAD1; At2g35100) and XYLOGALACTURONAN DEFICIENT1 (XGD1; At5g33290; Harholt et al., 2006; Jensen et al., 2008). ARAD1 and XGD1 are placed in subgroups B and C of CAZy family GT47, respectively (Fig. 3) according to the nomenclature of Li et al. (2004). Both proteins are apparent type II membrane proteins; based on localization studies of fluorescent fusion proteins, they are located in the Golgi apparatus (Harholt et al., 2006; Jensen et al., 2008; Sakuragi et al., 2010). ARAD1 is a putative arabinosyltransferase. Biochemical analysis of the loss-of-function arad1 mutants showed a reduced amount of Ara in the cell wall (Harholt et al., 2006). Further characterization showed that the arabinan side chains appeared to be of equal number but smaller than in the wild type. Heterologous expression of ARAD1 in Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris, and Nicotiana benthamiana, and attempts to demonstrate arabinosyltransferase activity by in vitro or in vivo assays, have so far been unsuccessful in spite of a substantial effort (A. Suttangkakul, J.K. Jensen, N. Geshi, T. Konishi, T. Ishii, and H.V. Scheller, unpublished data).Phylogenetic trees of CAZy GT47 subgroup B (A) and subgroup C (B). The trees contain sequences from Arabidopsis, rice, and P. patens. The trees were generated using Proml in the Phylip package.Subgroup B of CAZy GT47 includes, besides ARAD1, seven Arabidopsis homologs (Fig. 3A). The closest homolog to ARAD1 is designated ARAD2 (At5g44930). ARAD1 and ARAD2 are apparently not redundant, since expression of ARAD2 under the control of the 35S promoter in arad1 does not complement the arabinan deficiency of arad1 (J.K. Jensen, J. Harholt, and H.V. Scheller, unpublished data). However, immunohistochemical analysis of roots and inflorescence stems in arad1, arad2, and arad1 arad2 using the arabinan antibody LM13 showed different labeling from the wild type in all three mutants (Y. Verhertbruggen, J.P. Knox, J. Harholt, and H.V. Scheller, unpublished data). Furthermore, arad2 labeling had a distinct pattern from those in arad1 and arad1 arad2. The remaining members of CAZy GT47 subgroup B are still unassigned. Cell wall composition analysis of knockout mutants of some of the remaining CAZy GT47B members has not led to the discovery of new cell wall phenotypes (J. Harholt and H.V. Scheller, unpublished data).GTs involved in the biosynthesis of pectin and hemicelluloses have been hypothesized to function in complexes by several authors (Scheller et al., 2007; Mohnen, 2008; Ralet et al., 2008). It seems logical that such complexes could exist, but actual data to support this are limited. The only strong evidence is the observation, described above, that GAUT1 and GAUT7 are together in a complex involved in the biosynthesis of HG (Mohnen, 2008). Another argument for the existence of complexes is the observation that incorporation of arabinofuranose into polysaccharides takes place via the intermediate UDP-arabinofuranose (Konishi et al., 2006). The furanose form of UDP-Ara has never been found in plants and is energetically unfavorable, suggesting that UDP-arabinofuranose is strongly channeled (i.e. the mutase that converts UDP-arabinpyranose to UDP-arabinofuranose likely delivers the product directly to the arabinosyltransferase). Furthermore, the mutase is a soluble protein but located on the cytosolic side of Golgi membranes, suggesting that it interacts with integral membrane proteins in the Golgi. These considerations suggest that the enzymes are present in a complex or metabolon. Such interactions between donor sugar biosynthetic proteins and GTs have not been unambiguously demonstrated, but UGE4, an isoform of UDP-Glc 4-epimerase, was shown to be associated with galactosylation of xyloglucan but not of pectic galactan (Nguema-Ona et al., 2006). This apparent channeling of the product of UGE4 supports the hypothesis that donor sugar biosynthetic proteins could reside along with GTs in complexes. ARAD1 and ARAD2 are both involved in arabinan biosynthesis and therefore also are good candidates for the identification of complex formation. The CAZy GT47B proteins contain conserved C-terminal Cys residues, suggesting that disulfide bonds could play a role in complex formation. ARAD1 and/or ARAD2 were transiently expressed in N. benthamiana cells and analyzed by immunoblotting under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Under nonreducing conditions, the Mr of ARAD1 or ARAD2 protein appeared to be larger than expected (C. Søgaard, J. Harholt, and H.V. Scheller, unpublished data). ARAD1/ARAD2, ARAD1/ARAD1, and ARAD2/ARAD2 complexes were indicated by this approach and by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (S. Bernhard, Y. Sakuragi, J. Harholt, and H.V. Scheller, unpublished data).The XGA xylosyltransferase XGD1 is placed in CAZy GT47 subgroup C (Fig. 3B). Sugar composition and linkage analysis of loss-of-function mutants showed a substantially decreased content of XGA in the mutants (Jensen et al., 2008). Hydrolysis with a specific XGA endohydrolase confirmed the reduced XGA content. Transient expression of XGD1 in N. benthamiana cells and in vitro assays using microsomal preparations showed transfer of Xyl from UDP-Xyl to GalUA oligomers, thereby confirming the function of XGD1 as a XGA xylosyltransferase. Immunolabeling of xgd1 mutants using the XGA-specific LM8 antibody gave two surprising results. First, LM8 did not detect the major XGA present in vegetative tissues but only epitopes in the root tips and siliques. Second, the LM8-positive XGA was not reduced in the xgd1 mutant. This indicates that there are orthologous activities to XGD1, possibly encoded by the other members of CAZy GT47C.RGII biosynthesis has not been much studied. A group of proteins found to be involved in RGII biosynthesis is the Arabidopsis RGXT family in subgroup B of CAZy GT77. Members of this family with characterized functions include RGXT1, RGXT2, and RGXT3 (Egelund et al., 2006, 2008). These proteins have α-1,3-xylosyltransferase activity and can transfer Xyl from UDP-Xyl onto Fuc. This glycosidic linkage is only present in RGII, suggesting the role of this protein family in pectin biosynthesis. The activity of RGXT1, RGXT2, and RGXT3 has been tested in vitro using exogenously expressed proteins from various systems, including Baculovirus-transfected insect cells (Egelund et al., 2006, 2008), P. pastoris (Petersen et al., 2009), and transient expression in N. benthamiana leaves and E. coli (A. Oikawa, A. Suttangkakul, and H.V. Scheller, unpublished data). Besides Fuc, α-methyl-fucoside and α-Fuc-(1,4)-Rha, but not β-methyl-fucoside, function well as acceptors. Compared with other heterologously expressed GTs for which biochemical activity has been observed, the RGXT proteins are remarkably robust and show high activity. RGXT1 and RGXT2 can also add Xyl onto RGII acceptor substrates isolated from rgxt1 and rgxt2 mutant plants but not those isolated from the wild type (Egelund et al., 2006). This difference illustrated the subtle defects in RGII extracted from rgxt mutants that failed to be detected in sugar analysis of cell walls and physiological characterization of the mutants. Since the RGXT family in Arabidopsis has four members, with three shown to have similar biochemical function in vitro, it is likely that the lack of physiological phenotype is due to functional redundancy. Insertional mutations are available for At4g01220, the only member of this Arabidopsis family that has not been characterized. However, the lack of available mutations in RGXT3 as well as the close genomic proximity of RGXT1 and RGXT2 prevent the generation of quadruple mutants to address the functional redundancy in the family.RGII, with its complex structure and unique sugar linkages, must require a large number of GTs for its synthesis. However, neither forward nor reverse genetics has led to the identification of any of these. This may be due to redundancy (as for RGXTs) or the lethality of mutations. A cell adhesion mutant in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia was reported to be deficient in GlcUA residues of RGII, suggesting that the affected protein, designated NpGUT1 (for glucuronosyltransferase 1), was specifically involved in RGII biosynthesis (Iwai et al., 2002). However, apparent orthologous genes in Arabidopsis, designated IRX10 and IRX10L, are strongly implicated to be involved in xylan biosynthesis, and the corresponding Arabidopsis mutants have no change in RGII structure (Wu et al., 2009). Wu et al. (2009) furthermore presented evidence suggesting that NpGUT1 and IRX10/IRX10L are indeed orthologs. This strongly suggests that the effect on RGII in the N. plumbaginifolia mutant was a pleiotropic effect and that NpGUT1 is not directly involved in RGII biosynthesis.Methyl esterification of pectin using S-adenosyl-Met as methyl donor has been shown in vitro (Goubet and Mohnen, 1999), but no methyltransferases have been unambiguously identified. A mutant designated qua2 was shown to be deficient in pectin, and when the mutated gene was identified, it turned out to be a putative methyltransferase (Mouille et al., 2007). The QUA2 enzyme is a member of a large group of putative methyltransferases, but their biochemical activity has not been confirmed and it is not known how many of the enzymes are involved in pectin biosynthesis. Finding a large group of pectin methyltransferases would perhaps not be so surprising, given that the Arabidopsis genome encodes no less than 67 putative pectin methylesterases (CAZy family CE8). Controlling the degree of pectin methylation must be very important for plants.Pectin acetylation with acetyl-CoA as the acetate donor has also been demonstrated in vitro (Pauly and Scheller, 2000). As for methylation, the process appears to take place in Golgi vesicles. Recently, two allelic Arabidopsis mutants have been identified that have decreased levels of pectin acetylation in leaves (Scheller, 2010; Y. Manabe and H.V. Scheller, unpublished data). The mutants, designated reduced wall acetylation2 (rwa2), have inactivation of the At3g06550 locus. The RWA2 protein is homologous to a protein involved in acetylation of the coat polysaccharide in the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (Janbon et al., 2001). Arabidopsis has three additional homologs of the RWA2 protein, and these are most likely involved in acetylation in different tissues. At present, it is unclear if the proteins are indeed acetyltransferases or have another function (e.g. as transporters). The RWA proteins are integral membrane proteins with many transmembrane segments. It is also not clear if the proteins are specific for pectin, but most likely this is not the case. One of the homologs in Arabidopsis and a homolog in poplar (Populus species) are highly expressed in tissues with secondary wall synthesis, which contain little pectin. Therefore, the RWA homologs expressed in these tissues may be primarily involved in xylan acetylation rather than pectin acetylation.In Chenopodiaceae species (e.g. spinach [Spinacia oleracea] and sugar beet [Beta vulgaris]), RGI side chains are feruloylated by attachment of ferulic acid to O-3 of Ara in arabinans or to O-4 of Gal in galactans (Fry, 1982). Jones et al. (2005) have shown that ferulic acid esterase and arabinanase affect stomatal function in plants outside Chenopodiaceae, and it may be that pectic feruloylation is taxonomically widespread but of low abundance. Recently, genes involved in feruloylation of arabinoxylan have been identified in rice (Mitchell et al., 2007; Piston et al., 2010). These genes belong to a large family encoding CoA-acyl transferases. At the moment, members of this family are the most likely candidates for pectin feruloyl transferases, but no evidence for or against this hypothesis has been presented.The recent sequencing of Selaginella moellendorffii, a heterosporus lycopsid, and the availability of the genome sequence of the moss Physcomitrella patens give new insight into the evolution of pectin biosynthesis.The synthesis of HG and probably also the RGII backbone is catalyzed by the GAUT group of genes in GT8, as described above. GAUT1 has S. moellendorffii and P. patens orthologs, in line with the presence of HG in both species (Moller et al., 2007). As described above, GAUT7 in Arabidopsis forms a complex with GAUT1 and is presumably involved in HG biosynthesis as well (Mohnen, 2008). However, there is no GAUT7 homolog in either S. moellendorffii or P. patens. QUA1 is also involved in HG biosynthesis, even though the exact activity of QUA1 has not been established and pleiotropic effects have been observed (Bouton et al., 2002; Orfila et al., 2005). P. patens does not contain any QUA1 ortholog, whereas S. moellendorffii does, pointing to a possible gradual evolution of HG biosynthesis, with complex formation requiring GAUT7 in angiosperms as the most recent development.S. moellendorffii ARAD1 is a close homolog of Arabidopsis ARAD1, but no P. patens ARAD1 ortholog could be found (Fig. 3A). Since arabinan is present in P. patens cell walls, other members of the GT47B clade could be anticipated to be involved in arabinan biosynthesis. The Arabidopsis XGD1 lacks orthologs in both P. patens and S. moellendorffii. Interestingly, the most similar S. moellendorffii gene, GT47C1, occupies a separate subclade, which also has a P. patens member. The presence or absence of XGA in S. moellendorffii and P. patens has not been reported. S. moellendorffii has orthologous genes to RGXT. While Arabidopsis apparently has three or four RGXT paralogs (Egelund et al., 2006, 2008) in the RGXT clade, rice, P. patens, and S. moellendorffii have a single RGXT ortholog. Whether RGII is present in mosses has not been determined unambiguously. Some of the rare sugars of RGII have been found in mosses, but in concentrations 100-fold lower than expected if compared with higher plants (Matsunaga et al., 2004). The presence of an RGXT ortholog in P. patens suggests the occurrence of at least part of RGII in mosses.The seeming omnipresence of pectin throughout plant evolution calls for a look at algae cell walls to determine the presence of pectins. The charophycean and chlorophycean algae are known to contain HG in their cell walls (Cherno et al., 1976; Domozych et al., 2007; Estevez et al., 2008). RGI and its side chains of arabinan and galactan or RGII, to our knowledge, have not been identified in algae. Labeling with LM5 and LM6 antibodies, which recognize galactans and arabinans, respectively, has been observed in Chlorophyta, but the epitopes were mainly found in the cytoplasm (Estevez et al., 2008). Genomic sequences are available for bryophytes (P. patens), lycophytes (S. moellendorffii), and several angiosperm species (e.g. rice and Arabidopsis). However, because the wall polysaccharides found in these species are surprisingly similar, the comparative genome analysis is unlikely to yield much new evidence for putative functions of GTs. In contrast, the known differences in cell walls between charophycean and chlorophycean species and the land plants suggest that a comparative genomic study would be very revealing and could give valuable information on putative functions of GTs and many other aspects of cell wall biosynthesis.Pectin biosynthesis requires many enzymes, the large majority of which have not been identified. Reverse genetics of a very large number of GTs has not led to the discovery of many enzymes involved in pectin biosynthesis. Perhaps this is due to redundancy, so that simultaneous mutations in more than one gene homolog are necessary to see significant changes in wall composition or visual phenotype. This then raises the question of what strategies will be most promising for identifying the remaining biosynthetic enzymes. A systematic analysis of the activity of heterologously expressed GTs may be a good strategy. However, there is a paucity of general assays for GT activity. Furthermore, it may well be that many of the pectin biosynthetic enzymes function in complexes and that the individual GT proteins have little or no activity. These technical difficulties suggest that it may be prudent to focus the efforts on the most promising and interesting candidates. Coexpression analysis has proven to be a very powerful method to identify proteins, including GTs, involved in secondary wall biosynthesis (Brown et al., 2005; Persson et al., 2005). The expression profiles for pectin biosynthetic enzymes are bound to be less distinct; nevertheless, such methods may be useful to short list GTs that are likely to be involved in pectin biosynthesis. Expression analysis, or proteomics, of tissues with dominating synthesis of a particular polysaccharide is a related method to identify GTs involved in synthesizing that particular polysaccharide. Cellulose synthase and mannan synthase were identified in this way (Pear et al., 1996; Dhugga et al., 2004). Some plant organs are highly enriched in pectin (e.g. certain fruits). Seeds of some legumes (e.g. lupin) are highly enriched in pectic galactan, which serves as a storage polysaccharide. Hence, deep sequencing of expressed genes in such plant tissues and organs would likely lead to candidates for further analysis. Deep sequencing of developing lupin seeds has been undertaken in order to identify putative candidates for GTs involved primarily in galactan biosynthesis. A finding of potential relevance to galactan biosynthesis was the high expression of members of the C3 group of GT47 (B. Borkhardt and P. Ulvskov, unpublished data). GT47 with its inverting activities could contain galactan galactosyltransferases, and a closer look at GT47C proteins and corresponding mutants would be interesting. Manfield et al. (2004) used microarrays to compare the expression profile of isoxaben-habituated suspension cells with unhabituated cells. Since isoxaben, an inhibitor of cellulose synthesis, leads to increased deposition of noncellulosic polysaccharides, including pectin, putative pectic biosynthetic GTs might be identified, but unfortunately no obvious candidates were identified.In addition to the challenge of assigning functions to GTs found in CAZy by biochemical or reverse genetic approaches, it is now also clear that there are multiple families of GTs not found in CAZy. Several reports on bioinformatic work leading to the discovery of putative GTs outside CAZy have been published (Egelund et al., 2004; Manfield et al., 2004; Hansen et al., 2009). Of these putative GTs, a family designated DUF266 has subsequently been shown to contain GTs involved in cell wall biosynthesis (Zhou et al., 2009). The DUF266 family is still not part of CAZy, and it exemplifies that some of the major activities missing in our knowledge of pectin biosynthesis could reside outside CAZy.Pectin has many features, and perhaps perturbations to minor side chains of arabinans and galactans would not be readily observed by the approaches currently utilized in the effort to elucidate pectin biosynthesis. However, it may seem surprising that no candidates for the major galactan biosynthetic enzymes or the enzymes involved in synthesizing the RGI backbone have emerged. The RGI backbone is also a major component of pectin, yet no Rha-deficient mutant affected in a GT has been reported. The biosynthesis of the backbone has not been studied, possibly because the UDP-Rha substrate needed for such studies is not available and is not easy to make. The rhamnosyltransferases should be inverting enzymes, but again we have no good candidates. Interestingly, the reducing end oligosaccharide of xylan contains a Rha residue; hence, there must be a rhamnosyltransferase involved in its synthesis. Several Arabidopsis mutants, irx7, irx8, and parvus, are deficient in synthesizing the oligosaccharide, but no obvious candidate for the rhamnosyltransferase has emerged from those studies (Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010). We think IRX7 is more likely to be a xylosyltransferase, and the other enzymes, IRX8/GAUT12 and PARVUS, are predicted to be retaining rather than inverting, as expected for the rhamnosyltransferase. The α-Rha-1,2-α-GalA linkage in the reducing end of xylan resembles the α-Rha-1,4-α-GalA linkage found in RGI; hence, identification of the rhamnosyltransferase involved in xylan biosynthesis may provide candidates for other rhamnosyltransferases, including those involved in RGI biosynthesis.RGII contains five Rha residues, all linked in different ways. Several other enzymes are needed for RGII biosynthesis, yet only RGXT has been identified. It seems surprising that not more of these enzymes have been discovered, given that RGII mutants are expected to show a pronounced phenotype. For RGXT, the reason for the weak phenotype is clearly that there are several redundant genes involved. Can this also be the case for all the other GTs required? It seems that there are not enough GTs encoded by the genome of Arabidopsis if each would have perhaps three to four redundant forms. We have previously proposed that the same set of GTs may form complexes with different composition and different biochemical activities (Scheller et al., 2007). This could explain both the extensive redundancy and the somewhat limited number of GTs with unassigned function. It could also explain the difficulty in determining the biochemical functions of heterologously expressed GTs. The idea that GT activities can be modulated by the presence of other proteins is supported by the classical example of mammalian β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, which changes its acceptor sugar from GlcNAc to Glc in the presence of α-lactalbumin (Ramakrishnan et al., 2002).With the improved biochemical tools, the ever-increasing amounts of genomic data, and the increased funding for bioenergy research, we can be hopeful that significant advances in our understanding of pectin biosynthesis can be achieved. Pectin is an important product, especially as an ingredient in the food industry. Knowledge of the biosynthesis of pectin should enable tailoring of pectins for specific purposes and could enable the use of pectin-rich raw materials that are currently not used because of their poor functionality. For example, potato and sugar beet pulp are available in large quantities but are not exploited as raw materials for pectin production. Pectin is not a major component of biomass feedstocks for biofuel production, which consist mostly of secondary cell walls with a low pectin content; nevertheless, the fine structure of pectin has an important impact on biomass recalcitrance (Lionetti et al., 2010). It is essential to get a better understanding of the GTs and other enzymes that directly synthesize the pectin polysaccharides, and this must be an important goal of current research efforts. However, one should also be aware that this is only the tip of the iceberg. Other enzymes play important roles in reshaping the polymers after they are synthesized, and plants have an even greater repertoire of carbohydrate-active hydrolases, esterases, and lyases than of synthetic enzymes. Furthermore, the polysaccharides are integrated into the wall by mechanisms that are not understood; surely, self-assembly is an important principle of wall assembly, but unknown factors may play a role as well. Finally, the wall composition is regulated by sensing and signal transduction pathways that we are only beginning to unravel (Hematy et al., 2007; Kohorn et al., 2009). To find out how all these processes work together is the next big challenge."
PMC2879814,Beyond the Green: Understanding the Evolutionary Puzzle of Plant and Algal Cell Walls1,False,"Niklas (2000) defined plants as “photosynthetic eukaryotes,” thereby including brown, red, and green macroalgae and microalgae. These groups share several features, including the presence of a complex, dynamic, and polysaccharide-rich cell wall. Cell walls in eukaryotes are thought to have evolved by lateral transfer from cell wall-producing organisms (Niklas, 2004). Green and red algae originate from a primary endosymbiotic event with a cyanobacterium, which is thought to have occurred over 1,500 million years ago (Palmer et al., 2004). Even though extant cyanobacteria have cell walls that are based on a peptidoglycan-polysaccharide-lipopolysaccharide matrix and thus differ markedly from the polysaccharide-rich cell walls of plants, there is preliminary evidence that they may contain some similar polysaccharides (Hoiczyk and Hansel, 2000), and genes already involved in polysaccharide synthesis or those subsequently coopted into wall biosynthesis may have been transferred during endosymbiosis. Independent secondary endosymbiotic events subsequently gave rise to the Euglenozoa (which lack cell walls) and brown algae (which have cell walls; Palmer et al., 2004). Investigations of the diversity of wall composition, structure, and biosynthesis that include algae, therefore, may lend new insights into wall evolution (Niklas, 2004).Algal cell wall research, in common with that of land plants, has focused on commercially important species and polysaccharides; thus, the most well-described algal wall components include the commercially and ecologically important laminarans, carrageenans, fucans, and alginates (Mabeau and Kloareg, 1997; Campo et al., 2009). However, there are over 35,600 species of seaweed, and their cell wall components exhibit enormous diversity (for review, see Painter, 1983; Kloareg and Quatrano, 1988; De Reviers, 2002). Even though distinct suites of polysaccharides are known to occur in different taxa such that algal cell wall profiles can be used as taxonomic markers (Parker, 1970; Domozych et al., 1980), some wall components have a wider distribution and are also found in other organisms, including land plants.Renewed interest in plant and algal cell wall composition (Popper and Fry, 2003, 2004; Niklas, 2004; Vissenberg et al., 2005; Van Sandt et al., 2007; Fry et al., 2008a, 2008b; Popper, 2008; Sørensen et al., 2008), perhaps driven by potential industrial applications (Pauly and Keegstra, 2008) and a desire to better understand cell wall functions (Niklas, 2004), has been facilitated by the development of several techniques capable of screening cell wall polymers. Increased information has added detail to the diversity known to exist in cell wall composition, generated as organisms adapted to specific niches (Sarkar et al., 2009). However, it is also becoming apparent that similarities, as well as differences, exist between plant and algal cell walls. Therefore, examination of the patterns of occurrence of wall components suggests that existing diversity is likely to be the result of a variety of different evolutionary scenarios.Investigation of the occurrence of wall components and the genes involved in their biosynthesis may suggest whether they are innovations within a particular lineage or have a more ancient origin. Mechanisms of cell wall biosynthesis may have evolved several times from diversification of gene families, may have been retained from ancestral organisms, or may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. While horizontal gene transfer is a rare event (Becker and Marin, 2009), several endosymbiotic events gave rise to photosynthetic organisms (Fig. 1; Keeling, 2004; Palmer et al., 2004) and could have been accompanied by transfer of wall biosynthesis genes (Niklas, 2004). Therefore, it could be expected that some cell wall genes and their products are common to both algae and plants. However, it is likely that the majority of land plant cell wall components are the products of directly inherited genes that have diversified within a particular lineage (Yin et al., 2009).Emergence of gene families (CesA and Csl) within the cellulose synthase superfamily responsible for cellulose and hemicellulose synthesis (Yin et al., 2009) mapped onto a simplified eukaryote phylogeny (Keeling, 2004; Palmer et al., 2004; Yoon et al., 2004; adapted from Keeling et al., 2009). CesA* represents members of the cellulose synthase family whose proteins assemble into rosette terminal complexes (Yin et al., 2009). CslA/C represents a single gene that is most similar to the land plant CslA and CslC gene families (Yin et al., 2009). The arrows indicate secondary endosymbiosis events involving green algae, which gave rise to the Euglenozoa (dotted arrow), and red algae, which gave rise to the Stramenopiles (dashed arrow; Keeling, 2004).The recent discovery of lignin in the cell walls of a red alga, Calliathron cheilosporioides (Martone et al., 2009), was surprising for a number of reasons. Most significantly, lignin is normally found in vascular plant cell walls (Table I), which probably last shared a common ancestor with red algae over 1 billion years ago (Martone et al., 2009). Furthermore, recorded diversity in wall composition is usually at a more subtle level and tends to mirror known taxonomic groups, such as the presence of acidic sugar residues in bryophyte xyloglucans (Peña et al., 2008). Thus, the existence of a cell wall component in two groups as distantly related as red algae and vascular plants leads us to consider how this may have occurred.+, Component is likely to be present; ±, component may be present; −, component is likely to be absent; *, component is absent but an unusual sugar residue constituent of the wall component is present.There are several evolutionary scenarios that could explain the occurrence of lignin in red algae and vascular plants: (1) lignin could have evolved independently in both lineages; (2) ancient algal genes leading to lignin biosynthesis could have been coopted during the evolution of vascular plants (Niklas and Kutschera, 2009, 2010); (3) the lignin biosynthesis pathway may have existed before the divergence of the embryophytes and subsequently lost from green algae (Xu et al., 2009); or (4) genes for lignin biosynthesis could have been transferred from one organism to another (Niklas, 2004). Lignin is composed of monolignol units. Within vascular plants, gymnosperm lignins are composed almost entirely of guaiacyl units, whereas angiosperm, lycopod (Jin et al., 2005), and Calliathron lignins additionally contain syringyl (S) lignin (Martone et al., 2009). However, S-lignins in lycopods and angiosperms, which diverged approximately 400 million years ago, are derived via distinctly different biosynthetic pathways, implying that S-units evolved in both plant groups via convergent evolution (Weng et al., 2008, 2010). Martone et al. (2009) suggest that S-lignin in Calliathron could represent another example of convergent evolution, and deduction of the lignin biosynthesis pathways in Calliathron could lend support to this theory. Conversely, if lignin was discovered in other algal groups, it could suggest that lignin biosynthesis in land plants has a more ancient origin.Another potential example of convergent evolution is (1→3),(1→4)-β-d-glucan (MLG), which has been reported from lichens (Honegger and Haisch, 2001; Olafsdottir and Ingolfsdottir, 2001), fungi (Burton and Fincher, 2009; Pettolino et al., 2009), green algae (Eder et al., 2008), horsetails (Equisetum spp.; Fry et al., 2008b; Sørensen et al., 2008), and Poales (Trethewey et al., 2005; Table I).Within land plants, MLG was only recently discovered in horsetails (Fry et al., 2008b; Sørensen et al., 2008) and was previously thought to have a restricted taxonomic distribution, occurring only in members of the Poales (Trethewey et al., 2005), which last shared a common ancestor with the horsetails over 370 million years ago (Bell and Hemsley, 2000). However, two independent groups, using several methods, concurrently discovered MLG in Equisetum cell walls. Fry et al. (2008b) digested horsetail wall preparations with an MLG-specific enzyme (lichenase; EC 3.2.1.73; Parrish et al., 1960). Quantification of the resulting oligosaccharides by high-pressure liquid chromatography revealed that Equisetum cell walls contain MLG at levels equal to or greater than those found in members of the Poales (Fry et al., 2008b). The presence of MLG in Equisetum cell walls was further supported, and localized within the wall, by monoclonal antibody (mAb) labeling (Sørensen et al., 2008) with a mAb that has a high degree of specificity to MLG (Meikle et al., 1994). The existence of MLG in horsetails was also found to be correlated with the occurrence of a wall-remodeling enzyme capable of grafting MLG to xyloglucan (Fry et al., 2008a).The cellulose synthase-like gene families CslF, CslH, and CslJ have been shown to be involved in MLG synthesis in grasses (Richmond and Somerville, 2000; Burton et al., 2006, 2008; Doblin et al., 2009). Since these gene families appear to have diverged from within other cellulose synthase-like gene families (Yin et al., 2009) after horsetails had diverged from the lineage that eventually led to the Poales (Fig. 1; Yin et al., 2009), it seems likely that MLG arose independently in horsetails and Poales. The existence of an MLG-like polysaccharide in several groups of only distantly related photosynthetic organisms, putatively including the brown algae (Z.A. Popper, E. Demange, M. Lorenz, and O. Curry, unpublished data; Table I), many of which existed prior to the divergence of the CslF, CslH, and CslJ (Yin et al., 2009), further supports multiple origins of the polymer (Burton and Fincher, 2009).While the mode of MLG synthesis may be different in Poales and Equisetum, it is of interest that the plants share some common morphological and biochemical features. Poales and horsetails exhibit similar body plans (Niklas, 2004). Additionally, they are both known to accumulate silica in their walls (Hodson et al., 2005), which Fry et al. (2008b) suggested may be correlated with the presence of MLG. If this were the case, it could be expected that liverworts, which have the highest relative mean shoot concentration of silica in land plants, could also contain MLG (Hodson et al., 2005). In fact, lichenase digestion of a cell wall preparation from the leafy liverwort Lophocolea bidentata has indicated that at least some liverworts may contain a polysaccharide similar to MLG (Popper and Fry, 2003). A silica transporter and mutants deficient in silica accumulation have been discovered in rice (Oryza sativa; Ma et al., 2006). If these plants exhibited alterations in MLG amount or deposition patterns, this would lend support to an interaction between MLG and silica.Perhaps the best examined cell wall biosynthetic genes are members of the cellulose synthase superfamily, which appears to have diversified within the land plant lineage to give nine cellulose synthase-like families and one cellulose synthase (CesA) family (Yin et al., 2009).Cellulose is the most abundant naturally occurring polymer (Hess et al., 1928) and has a widespread distribution, being found in plants (Brown, 1985), algae (Naylor and Russell-Wells, 1934), bacteria (Roberts et al., 2002), cyanobacteria (Nobels et al., 2001), and tunicates (Kimura and Itoh, 1995). In land plants, cellulose may account for 20% to 50% (w/w; and in specialized cell walls, such as cotton [Gossypium hirsutum] fibers, up to 98% [w/w]) of the wall, whereas in red algae, it may only account for 1% to 8% (w/w; Kloareg and Quatrano, 1988). CesAs are widespread among eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Tsekos, 1999; Roberts et al., 2002; Roberts and Roberts, 2009), but those that form rosette terminal complexes have only been sequenced from the land plant lineage (Yin et al., 2009) and probably evolved after the divergence of the land plants from the chlorophytes (Yin et al., 2009; Fig. 1). Cellulose in the Chlorophyta and red and brown algae is synthesized by CesA genes whose origin predates that of the plant-specific CesA genes (Yin et al., 2009) and whose products form linear terminal complexes (Tsekos, 1999). Roberts et al. (2002) suggested that the observed differences in cellulose microfibril diameter between different cellulose-containing organisms (Nobels et al., 2001) could be, at least partially, a result of known differences in the arrangement of terminal complexes (Tsekos, 1999).Mannans and glucomannans are synthesized by CslAs (Dhugga et al., 2004; Liepman et al., 2005; Goubet et al., 2009). While CslAs appear to be absent from green algae (Yin et al., 2009), these algae contain a specific Csl family that is most homologous to land plant CslA and CslC families (Yin et al., 2009; designated CslA/CslC in Fig. 1). Since mannans are known to occur in green algae, including Codium fragile (Estevez et al., 2009) and Acetabularia acetabulum (Dunn et al., 2007), the products of CslA/CslC could be responsible for mannan synthesis. CslA/CslC appears to be absent from brown and red algae (Yin et al., 2009; Fig. 1), suggesting that an absence of reports for mannans in brown algae (Table I) could be due to a lack of the required biosynthetic machinery. However, some red algae have been reported to contain mannans (Percival et al., 2001). The genes responsible for mannan synthesis in red algae may not be CslAs or their sequences may differ significantly from CslAs such that they were not detected in the screen used by Yin et al. (2009). Ostreococcus, an ancient member of the 1,500-million-year-old green lineage and the smallest known eukaryote (Derelle et al., 2006), was the earliest diverging organism found to contain CslA/CslC (Yin et al., 2009). Although Ostreococcus is wall-less, the existence of the products of CslA/CslC may be involved in cell-surface glycosylation, which Palenik et al. (2003, 2007) suggest may help disguise them from grazers. Taken in the context of a lack of all other plant-like Csl genes (Yin et al., 2009), the existence of a gene responsible for mannan synthesis in green algae and the subsequent evolution of a specific family of CslA genes suggest that the presence of mannan in their cell walls could have facilitated the success and diversification of green algae.Xylans represent a case for the possibility that some plant cell wall components are derived from genes that existed before the divergence of green and red algae. Xylans are found ubiquitously in vascular plants and appear to be present in hornworts (Carafa et al., 2005), charophycean green algae (Domozych et al., 2009), chlorophytes, and red algae (Lahaye et al., 2003), suggesting that they have a cosmopolitan distribution among cell walls of photosynthetic organisms (Table I). Xylans can either be (1→3) or (1→4) linked. Painter (1983) hypothesized that red algae were at an evolutionary branch point, as some red algae, including the relatively basal Bangia fuscopurpurea, are composed of (1→3) linkages while others, such as the more recently diverged Palmaria palmata, have been suggested to contain both (1→3) and (1→4) linkages in the same molecule (Turvey and Williams, 1970). Potentially, green algae and land plants derived the genes for (1→4)-β-d-xylan synthesis from red algae. Additionally, while many land plant cell wall polysaccharides appear to be synthesized by Csls that diverged after green algae (Yin et al., 2009; Fig. 1), evidence for the involvement of Csls in xylan biosynthesis appears to be lacking (Zhou et al., 2006). Instead, a large number of glycosyl transferases (GTs), including FRAGILE FIBER8 (GT47; GT numbers refer to those designated by the CAZy database [http://www.cazy.org]; Cantarel et al., 2009), IRREGULAR XYLEM8 (IRX8) and PARVUS (GT8), and IRX9 and IRX14 (GT43), are implicated (Brown et al., 2005, 2007; Lee et al., 2007; Peña et al., 2007; York and O'Neill, 2008). Querying the CAZy database (Cantarel et al., 2009) reveals that Ostreococcus (the smallest known eukaryote and a member of the prasinophycean green algae) appears to lack members of the GT43 family (Hashimoto et al., 2009) thought to be involved in xylan backbone synthesis (Lee et al., 2007). Ostreococcus contains several other GTs (http://www.cazy.org; Cantarel et al., 2009) that could have a role in xylan synthesis, including GT8, which is involved in glucuronoxylan synthesis (Lee et al., 2007), and GT4, which includes a 1,4-β-d-xylan synthase (EC 2.4.2.24; Bailey and Hassid, 1966), thus supporting an origin for xylan biosynthesis that predates the land plant lineage.Another group of wall components that appear to have ancient origins are arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), a group of proteoglycans that exhibit considerable structural and functional diversity and are thought to occur ubiquitously in land plants (Basile, 1980; Basile et al., 1989; Pennell et al., 1989; Knox et al., 1991; Lee et al., 2005). However, they may be much more widely distributed. Immunolabeling and chemical analyses have suggested their occurrence in the charophycean green algae (McCann et al., 2007; Domozych et al., 2009) and chlorophytes (Stanley et al., 2005; Eder et al., 2008; Estevez et al., 2009). We have also detected AGPs in extracts from red and brown algae using the radial gel diffusion assay (Z.A. Popper, Q. Coster, and T. Slattery, unpublished data). At least some AGP functions may be conserved between taxa; localization of AGPs in the utricle apical zone in C. fragile (Estevez et al., 2009) may suggest a role in tip growth that correlates with their reported involvement in the tip growth of moss protonemata (Lee et al., 2005).The model organism Chlamydomonas, which is a flagellated green alga, has walls that are substantially different from those of land plants, not least because they seem to lack cellulose (Roberts, 1974). Instead, the major wall components are layers of crystalline Ara-rich, Hyp-rich glycoproteins (Miller et al., 1974; Roberts, 1974; Bollig et al., 2007). However, closer examination of the Chlamydomonas glycoproteins shows that they appear to share some features with AGPs, including conservation of an inner core of two Ara residues linked to Hyp (Bollig et al., 2007). This lends support to the argument for a degree of conservation between plant and algal wall components. It also highlights the need for extensive sampling, as some green algae share other wall features with land plants (Fig. 1).Rhamnogalacturonan II (RGII) is perhaps the most distinct example of an innovation in wall composition to have occurred in land plants. It has a highly conserved structure and is present in all vascular plants (Matoh et al., 1996), but if present in extant bryophytes it constitutes less than 0.025% (w/w) of the wall (Matsunaga et al., 2004). Since RGII has not been detected in green algae (Domozych et al., 1980; Becker et al., 1994, 1998), it seems likely that its occurrence in land plants could be correlated with specific evolutionary pressures potentially related to terrestrialization. However, the ability to make some of the relatively unusual monosaccharide residues present in RGII, such as 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo; York et al., 1985), may have deeper origins. Most members of the prasinophyceae have scales or a theca (wall) containing Kdo (York et al., 1985; Becker et al., 1991; Domozych et al., 1991). CMP-Kdo synthetase (CKS) is responsible for generating the activated sugar donor CMP-Kdo required for the synthesis of wall polymers containing Kdo, and sequences for the CKS gene are present in every major plant group, including mosses (Royo et al., 2000). Neither Kdo nor CKS has been found in animals or yeasts. However, they are both present in gram-negative eubacteria (Royo et al., 2000), where they probably represent an example of horizontal gene transfer either from the bacteria to the plant or, more unusually, from the plant to the bacteria (Royo et al., 2000). It is of interest that a putative Kdo transferase gene (AtKDTA; Séveno et al., 2010) has recently been characterized. However, AtKDTA appears to represent an example of a gene that was not transferred from a bacterium (in this case, the ancestor of mitochondria) to a plant following an endosymbiotic event. The evidence for this is that AtKDTA synthesizes a protein that localizes to the mitochondria, where Séveno et al. (2010) hypothesize that it may be involved in the synthesis of a lipid A-like molecule. More significantly, in terms of plant cell wall synthesis, AtKDTA null mutants appear to have an unaltered phenotype and conserved RGII structure and amount, implying that AtKDTA is unlikely to be involved in RGII synthesis (Séveno et al., 2010).Xyloglucan may also represent a relatively recent innovation. It is present in all land plants (Popper and Fry, 2003, 2004), and immunolabeling suggests that it may be present in some members of the charophycean green algae (Ikegaya et al., 2008; Domozych et al., 2009). The occurrence of xyloglucans in other photosynthetic organisms is unknown (Table I). In addition, the enzymes involved in xyloglucan synthesis appear to have continued to diversify within the land plants. This is suggested by the discovery that moss and liverwort xyloglucans contain GalUA and are structurally distinct from xyloglucans synthesized by vascular plants and hornworts (Peña et al., 2008). There are also several xyloglucan side chains that may be restricted to the relatively recently diverged Asteridae (Hoffman et al., 2005). Furthermore, activity of the enzyme xyloglucan endotransglucosylase, involved in xyloglucan modification (Thompson and Fry, 2001) and consequently plant growth and differentiation (Vissenberg et al., 2005), was found in the chlorophyte Ulva linza but appeared to be absent from red and brown algae (Van Sandt et al., 2007). This suggests that xyloglucan or a structurally similar polysaccharide does not occur in the cell walls of either red or brown algae.Pectins and pectin-like polymers appear to have a relatively cosmopolitan occurrence and are found in red and green algae as well as land plants (Painter, 1983; Domozych et al., 2007; Eder and Lütz-Meindl, 2008). A polysaccharide has even been isolated from the cyanobacterium Microcystis flos-aquae, which contains the monosaccharide residues GalUA, Rha, Man, Xyl, Glc, and Gal in a similar molar ratio to that found in pectin, although the degree of structural similarity has not been determined (Plude et al., 1991). However, arabinans might be expected to be a land plant innovation. Specifically, they could be predicted to occur only in hornworts and vascular plants because they have been implicated in stomatal opening (Jones et al., 2003). However, LM6, a mAb that recognizes short linear stretches of arabinosyl residues, not only labels guard cell walls (Jones et al., 2003) but has also been found to bind to Chara cell walls (Domozych et al., 2009). The recruitment of arabinans in guard cell function, therefore, might be an example of cooption in function of a preexisting wall polymer.Correlating the occurrence of genes and wall components with phylogenies, as given for CesA and Csls (Fig. 1), undoubtedly has the potential to reveal new insights into wall evolution. However, as discussed by Sørensen et al. (2010), it is dependent on adequate sampling. This could be approached by the detailed analysis of representative plants, but screening may help to optimize which plants are selected for further analysis. With conservative estimates of 260,000 vascular plant species alone (Judd et al., 2002; Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2003), investigation of the cell wall composition of photosynthetic organisms necessarily demands a high-throughput approach (Sørensen et al., 2010). The total number of samples is further expanded by taking into consideration variation between tissues and between stages in the life cycle (Sørensen et al., 2010). For example, based on analysis of the products released by enzyme digestion of vegetative cells, xyloglucan was thought to be absent from Chara (Popper and Fry, 2003). However, more recent evidence provided by mAb labeling suggests that xyloglucan may occur in the walls of Chara antheridia (Domozych et al., 2009). Additional evidence will be necessary to determine whether xyloglucan actually does occur in Chara cell walls, because although an anti-xyloglucan mAb was capable of recognizing and binding to an epitope present in Chara cell walls, that epitope could be part of a polymer that is not xyloglucan.Several techniques have been developed that could greatly facilitate the investigation of wall diversity, including Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (FT-IR; Mouille et al., 2003), oligosaccharide mass profiling (OLIMP; Obel et al., 2006), and comprehensive microarray polymer profiling (CoMPP; Willats et al., 2002; Sørensen et al., 2008).FT-IR is capable of generating a fingerprint that can distinguish between Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants with altered cellulose, pectin, and xyloglucan compositions (Mouille et al., 2003). This method could be extended to profile different taxa. However, peaks may shift depending on molecular interactions and the environment within the wall (Kačuráková et al., 2000), a phenomenon that is likely to be even more pronounced between distantly related taxa, making unambiguous peak assignment and attribution difficult.OLIMP utilizes highly specific hydrolases to digest wall components (Obel et al., 2006). The digestion products are then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, and structural differences are indicated by changes in observed ions (Obel et al., 2006). This method has been applied to the investigation of Arabidopsis cell wall polysaccharides (Obel et al., 2006; Gille et al., 2009) but could be extremely valuable for screening for the existence of structural differences between polysaccharides within diverse plant taxa. Polysaccharides with unknown or unusual structures could then be subjected to further and more detailed methods of analysis. However, structural analysis of a cell wall component using OLIMP is dependent on its ability to be hydrolyzed, and in some taxa a wall component could be present but resist hydrolysis. We recently found that several species of brown algae can be labeled with a mAb that has a high specificity for (1→3),(1→4)-β-d-glucan (Meikle et al., 1994; Z.A. Popper and E. Demange, unpublished data). In addition, polysaccharides extracted from the wall using strong alkali could be digested with lichenase. However, digestion of brown algal cell walls with lichenase prior to labeling did not prevent the anti-MLG mAb from binding (Z.A. Popper and M. Lorenz, unpublished data). It seems likely that digestion was prevented by the presence of high concentrations of wall-bound phenolic compounds (Schoenwaelder and Clayton, 1998, 1999), which have been shown to inhibit enzyme activity (Barwell et al., 1989; Shibata et al., 2003).To date, CoMPP is the technique that has been most extensively applied toward screening cell wall diversity (Sørensen et al., 2008) and has already resulted in some interesting discoveries, such as the presence of MLG in horsetail cell walls (Sørensen et al., 2008), as discussed earlier.Using CoMPP, an indication of the likely presence of specific cell wall components within a particular plant species, tissue, or developmental stage is dependent on the reaction of extracted wall components with mAbs or carbohydrate-binding molecules (Moller et al., 2007). Thus, the availability of mAbs and carbohydrate-binding molecules currently limits the full potential of CoMPP. Increased numbers of mAbs, which are continuing to become available (Pattathil et al., 2010), will increase the power of CoMPP and greatly facilitate the analysis of cell wall diversity. The majority of cell wall-specific mAbs were generated against polysaccharides isolated from flowering plant cell walls, but there are exceptions, including those generated against polysaccharides from brown seaweeds (Vreeland, 1972; Vreeland et al., 1982, 1984). Furthermore, each mAb detects a specific epitope wherever it occurs, although interpretation may be complicated by the fact that the epitope recognized by a mAb can exist in different wall components in different taxa.CoMPP is frequently followed by more extensive characterization of the cell wall using a variety of techniques to both confirm and add detail to the initial results (Sørensen et al., 2008, 2010). In situ methods enable investigation of the wall components in their native environment, facilitating exploration of their intramural associations.One of the most frequently used in situ methods is labeling using mAbs or carbohydrate-binding molecules. This method can map the tissue-specific location of cell wall components and, when used in concert with advanced microscopy techniques such as electron tomography, can even enable three-dimensional visualization of a component within the wall (Mastronarde, 1997; Otegui et al., 2001; Otegui and Staehelin, 2004; Segui-Simarro et al., 2004). It has been found that the presence of high concentrations of pectin can mask, or prevent, mAb labeling of xyloglucan (Marcus et al., 2008). While the phenomenon of masking complicates the interpretation of mAb labeling, it also yields details regarding interactions between wall components that can be unveiled by a strategy that combines specific enzyme digestion with mAb labeling (Marcus et al., 2008). Further complications could arise from the presence of cell wall components that render hydrolytic enzymes inactive. However, mAb labeling can also be combined with a variety of chemical pretreatments; incubation of Fucus sections in EDTA prior to mAb labeling was found to improve antibody penetration (Vreeland et al., 1984).Becker and Marin (2009) stated that they were “convinced that many plant ‘innovations’ will actually turn out to be innovations of the streptophyte algae,” whereas Niklas (2004) suggested that some plant cell wall features may have even deeper roots and share origins with more ancient algal ancestors. Both hypotheses may be true for different wall components.Despite the fact that the chlorophytes and streptophytes (land plants and charophycean green algae) last shared a common ancestor 725 to 1,200 million years ago (Becker and Marin, 2009), it appears that through a combination of shared ancestry and convergent evolution they have some common cell wall characteristics. They also share some wall features with red and brown algae (summarized in Table I), to which they are even more distantly related (Yoon et al., 2004). Therefore, while cell wall differentiation may have been of high adaptive importance (Stebbins, 1992), it appears that a degree of conservation also exists. Further characterization of plant and algal cell wall polysaccharides and the enzymes that synthesize them may reveal the existence of core features common to eukaryotic cell walls, despite the presence of different cooccurring cell wall components and diverse intramural interactions.We thank the editor and reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions and David Domozych, Iben Sørensen, and William Willats for allowing us to read a preprint edition of “How Did Plant Cell Walls Evolve?”"
PMC2880894,How Sweet it is! Cell Wall Biogenesis and Polysaccharide Capsule Formation in Cryptococcus neoformans,False,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic fungus responsible for severe opportunistic infections. The most prominent feature of this yeast is its elaborate polysaccharide capsule, a complex structure that is required for virulence. The capsule is intimately associated with the cell wall, which underlies the capsule and offers the organism strength and flexibility in potentially hostile environments. Both structures are primarily composed of polysaccharides, offering a glimpse of the tremendous variation inherent in natural carbohydrate structures and their multiple biological functions. The steps in cell wall and capsule biosynthesis and assembly pose fascinating questions of metabolism, enzymology, cell biology, and regulation; the answers have potential application to treatment of a deadly infection. This article reviews current knowledge of cryptococcal cell wall and capsule biosynthesis and outstanding questions for the future.Surface structures are critical to microbial pathogenesis. In some cases, these molecules provide the pathogen with physical protection; in others, they determine whether invading microbes are detected by the host or deceive it by camouflage or mimicry. Surface components may also confer tissue specificity and guide dissemination within the host, mediate pathogen binding to or uptake by host cells, or stimulate and modulate host immune responses. Any one of these functions can determine the outcome of an infection.The external structures of microbes include viral capsids and envelopes, parasite surface coats, and capsules and cell walls of bacteria and fungi. These protein, lipid, or carbohydrate assemblies range from relatively simple oligomers to complex macromolecules or extensive polymers. They may incorporate unique moieties not found in the host, as with core oligosaccharides of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, or at the other extreme they may mimic host structures, as with the hyaluronan capsule of group A Streptococcus.How can we productively generalize about this astounding variety of pathogen surface molecules? One approach is to step back from their myriad forms and functions and instead examine their biosynthesis, in search of common themes that may lead to a broader biological understanding of these structures and potentially exploitable aspects of their biogenesis. Such themes include the provision of precursors for surface molecule production, the sites and topology of the synthetic machinery, the pathways for surface component biosynthesis, and the final assembly of external structures. This review examines these biosynthetic themes as they apply to the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans.Like other yeasts, C. neoformans is bounded by a plasma membrane and polysaccharide-based cell wall. Beyond these, it displays an extensive polysaccharide capsule that is closely associated with the wall (Figure 1) and is required for virulence (23, 55, 116, 137); this structure distinguishes C. neoformans from other pathogenic fungi. This article explores biosynthesis of the cell wall and capsule to review current knowledge and stimulate consideration of the many intriguing yet unanswered questions in this fascinating area of research.Quick-freeze deep-etch image of the edge of a budding cryptococcal cell. The plasma membrane (lower left) is separated by the double-layered cell wall from the capsule meshwork (upper right). The wall and capsule surround both the parent cell and the newly emerging bud. Reprinted, with permission, from the cover image associated with Reference 122.The C. neoformans species complex, with subspecies C. gattii and C. neoformans (17, 88, 92), likely diverged from the lineage of ascomycetes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae ~1000 mya (68). Historically, Cryptococcus isolates were categorized by serotype, based on a defined set of capsule-reactive immune sera (28). C. gattii includes serotypes B and C, while strains classified as serotypes A, D, or AD hybrids make up C. neoformans. Serotypes A and D have also been classified as varieties of C. neoformans, var. grubii and var. neoformans, respectively (52), although molecular typing allows more definitive strain classification (17, 88, 92). Genome sequence information for serotypes A and D is available (see Related Resources).C. gattii occurs in subtropical regions and generally infects immunocompetent mammals. C. neoformans occurs ubiquitously in the environment and causes opportunistic infections in patients who are deficient in cell-mediated immunity. Most C. neoformans disease is caused by serotype A strains (154). Although C. neoformans came to broad attention as the cause of an AIDS-defining illness (extrapulmonary cryptococcosis), in recent years disease in HIV-negative patients has increased and presents new clinical challenges (28).Cryptococcosis is contracted upon inhalation of an infectious particle, either a spore or desiccated yeast cell (16, 28, 92). In the context of a healthy individual the invading microbe is either cleared, without significant symptoms but leaving immunological evidence of its presence (62), or perhaps sequestered to emerge later in the event of immune compromise (57, 130). In immunocompromised hosts, however, C. neoformans causes a pulmonary infection that can disseminate widely, most commonly to the brain (Figure 2) and the skin (28). The former leads to a meningoencephalitis that is fatal without treatment and is the most devastating manifestation of cryptococcal disease.(a) Cryptococcosis is contracted by inhalation of the infectious particle, which initiates a pulmonary infection. The most common site of dissemination is the central nervous system. (b) Images (top to bottom): infected lung tissue, infected brain tissue, and an India Ink stain of cryptococcal cells showing the characteristic halo appearance where capsule material excludes the ink particles. Lung histology image adapted from Reference 117; brain histology image courtesy of Dimitri Agamonolis.C. neoformans has a substantial impact on human health; recent estimates suggest almost 1 million cases per year among HIV-positive individuals leading to over 600,000 deaths annually (115). Regions with poor access to health care experience extremely high mortality attributed to cryptococcosis in HIV-positive patients (35), with median survival after diagnosis of less than one month (54). In developed countries incidence and mortality have fallen dramatically since the early AIDS epidemic (95, 101), but new groups of susceptible patients have appeared due to therapies that alter immunity (28). Furthermore, even the best current therapy does not completely clear cryptococcal infection. This necessitates long-term treatment with antifungal drugs, which exacerbates existing problems of cost, adverse reactions, and drug resistance.Established antifungal drugs interfere with the synthesis of fungal membranes, protein, and nucleic acids. The newest compounds impair cell wall synthesis and are highly effective against some fungal infections, although not against cryptococcosis. In C. neoformans the capsule has attracted attention as a potential drug target because of its central role in virulence. Powerful incentive to study the biosynthesis of the cell wall and capsule thus comes from their fascinating biology combined with the grim impact of cryptococcal disease and the need for effective and available antifungal therapy.Fungal cell walls provide strength and rigidity, protecting cells from environmental stress and osmotic lysis while maintaining cell shape and regulating permeability (65, 82). Remarkably, these powerful structures are also flexible and dynamic, allowing dramatic morphologic changes during mating, budding, and other cellular interactions and enabling cells to transition between environments as different as ecological niches and the mammalian bloodstream. Notably, mammalian cells have no analogous structures, making the cell wall a potential Achilles’ heel of fungal pathogens.Cryptococcal cell walls include glucan, chitin, and glycosylated protein. They are further enhanced by the presence of melanin (63, 151), which may influence wall porosity (73), and immunogenic membrane-derived glucosylceramides (9, 124). Morphologically, the wall is a two-layered structure (Figure 1): The striated inner layer has fibers arranged parallel to the plasma membrane, while the outer layer appears more particulate (122, 131).Like other glycans, cell wall carbohydrates are synthesized in a template-independent process by the coordinated action of glycosyltransferases, with their final structures depending on enzyme activities, the levels of sugar donor molecules, and the availability of acceptor substrates. Nucleotide sugars serve as the activated donors for this synthesis, including UDP-glucose for glucan, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine for chitin, and GDP-mannose for protein modification. Synthesis of the two UDP sugars has not been directly examined in C. neoformans; GDP-mannose synthesis is discussed below.The cryptococcal wall contains abundant α-glucans, mainly 1,3 linked (78) and likely generated from UDP-glucose by a membrane-bound α-glucan synthase, Ags1p (121). Ags1p homologs in other fungi are cell surface proteins thought to function in priming, polymerization, and translocation of glucan (67). Analysis of ags1Δ mutants, together with immuno-electron microscopy (EM) of normal cells, suggests that the inner layer of the cryptococcal wall consists of an alkali-insoluble meshwork of β-glucan and chitin and that the outer layer corresponds to an alkali-soluble fraction containing mainly α- and β-glucans; loss of the α1,3-glucan decimates this structure. ags1Δ cryptococci partially compensate with increased chitin and β-glucan redistribution (122), but their cell walls are still malformed, hypertrophic, and fragile. These cells display no surface capsule, although they still shed capsule polysaccharides (122). This indicates a required association of capsule with wall α1,3-glucan, although we do not yet know whether this interaction is direct or indirect via another cellular component. A recent report suggests that chitin or chitosan participates in capsule association with the cell wall (126); the relationship between these observations remains to be determined.Significant β1,3-glucan is also present in cryptococcal cell walls (78). In other yeast this occurs as polymers of ~1500 residues branched by β1,6-linkages (123). Its synthesis from cytosolic UDP-glucose is mediated by a plasma membrane-localized complex that includes a regulatory subunit, Rho1p, and a likely catalytic subunit, Fks1p. Glucan synthase activity is effectively inhibited by echinocandin compounds, which are now used to treat multiple fungal infections (81). Unfortunately, these compounds are not effective in C. neoformans (1). This is puzzling because the single Fks1p in C. neoformans is essential (142) and is susceptible to these inhibitors in vitro (96). Further study may enable the design of related compounds or combination therapy to allow use of these well-tolerated drugs for cryptococcal infection (37, 120). Until then, the echinocandins still provide a powerful example of extracellular polysaccharide synthesis as a suitable drug target in fungi.A third glucan present in fungi, including C. neoformans, is β1,6 linked. This glucan is typically shorter and more highly branched than the others. It can be covalently linked to β1,3-glucan, chitin, and cell wall proteins, integrating these cell wall components via multiple physical connections that confer wall elasticity and strength (65, 82). Cryptococcal β1,6-glucan is more abundant relative to β1,3-glucan than in other yeasts (10, 78) and has been observed in covalent linkage to protein (135). β1,6-glucan synthesis is complex and depends on multiple genes; in several ascomycetes a dominant role is played by KRE5 (89, 134). Deletion of the cryptococcal homolog of this gene eliminates soluble β1,6-glucan and severely compromises cell integrity (N.M. Gilbert &J.K. Lodge, unpublished data).Chitin is a relatively minor cell wall component, but its hydrogen-bond-stabilized association into microfibrils strengthens the wall structure (65). This linear polymer of β1,4-N-acetylglucosamine is generated from cytosolic UDP-N-acetylglucosamine by membrane-associated synthases that translocate the growing chain across the cell membrane. C. neoformans encodes eight putative chitin synthases and three potential regulatory proteins, presumably coordinated to spatially and temporally regulate chitin deposition (6). Systematic gene deletion showed that although no single gene of this group is essential for viability, one synthase (Chs3p) and one regulator (Csr2p) play a dominant role in cell integrity and cell wall function; deletion of either gene yields stress-sensitive cells with morphological alterations and the inability to retain melanin (6).Chitin can be deacetylated to produce chitosan, a more soluble and flexible polymer. C. neoformans has unusually high levels of chitosan during vegetative growth compared with model yeasts; chitosan content may exceed chitin content by up to 10-fold (6). In chs3Δ and csr2Δ mutants the chitosan fraction is significantly reduced, although an increase in chitin partly compensates for this change. It may be that only chitin formed by specific synthases may be subsequently deacetylated (6). Genes encoding three putative chitin deacetylases occur in C. neoformans. A triple mutation (cda1Δ cda2Δ cda3Δ) is required to eliminate chitosan; this mutant has increased chitin and exhibits defects in cell integrity and separation (5).Several classes of cell wall glycoproteins occur in fungi. One is composed of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins that have been transferred, with part of their anchor glycan, to covalent linkage with β1,6-glucan (64). A second group of proteins crosslinks β1,3-glucan, while members of a third group associate with other wall proteins via disulfide binding or charge interactions (156). Studies in C. neoformans have focused on the GPI-anchored proteins.Nascent glycoproteins destined for the cell wall are glycosylated as they transit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi (reviewed for C. neoformans in References 85 and 91). Some proteins receive GPI anchors, which are similar in C. neoformans and S. cerevisiae (50). In silico analyses of the cryptococcal genome (94) predict over 50 GPI-modified proteins (39, 91). Twenty-nine of these were identified in proteomic analysis of wall polypeptides released by protease or β-glucanase digestion (45); the latter treatment presumably released proteins that were covalently linked to glucan via a GPI remnant. This was demonstrated for a phospholipase B1 important for cryptococcal virulence (29): Treating cells with β1,3-glucanase released the protein modified with β1,6-glucan. The naturally secreted phospholipase was similarly modified, suggesting wall linkage as an intermediate in protein release (135). Another notable GPI-anchored protein in C. neoformans is the homolog of S. cerevisiae Gas1p. Gas1p remodels β1,3-glucan, consistent with cell wall localization (91).In addition to GPI anchoring, cell wall proteins are extensively modified with O-linked and N-linked glycans. Fungal O-glycan synthesis is initiated when protein mannosyltransferases (Pmts) modify serine or threonine residues, often present in clusters (150). Three cryptococcal Pmts have been identified; the disruption of one of these yielded stress-sensitive mutants with abnormal morphology, defects in cell separation, decreased protein mannosylation, and reduced virulence (112). Although C. neoformans O-glycans have not been directly characterized, biochemical studies in a related nonpathogenic species, Cryptococcus laurentii, identified three classes: linear α1,2-linked trimannose structures, oligomannose chains modified with xylose, and extended chains of α1,6-galactose linked to a single mannose (133). Given the variability of O-glycosylation across fungi (60) it is hard to predict what structures will be found in C. neoformans.Genome analysis suggests that the core N-glycan added to proteins in the cryptococcal ER consists of nine mannose and two N-acetylglucosamine residues, a truncated structure lacking the usual distal glucose residues (132). Once attached, fungal N-glycans may be core modified, typically generating structures of~15 residues, or more extensively outer chain modified to form mannan. Surprisingly, genes encoding the machinery for outer chain synthesis are lacking in C. neoformans (85, 91). Although this may indicate that cryptococcal N-glycans are not extended, more interesting possibilities are that either the synthetic machinery or the structures themselves are unique. In support of the latter, cryptococcal proteins may be modified with sialic acid (127) or xylose (M.C. Reilly & T.L. Doering, unpublished data), neither of which is present in model yeast. Structural analysis of mature cryptococcal N-glycans will be needed to resolve this issue.Major interest in cell wall mannoproteins derives from their critical role in stimulating T-cell responses (91). One such protein, MP-98 (90), is the chitin deacetylase Cda2p (5); another, MP84, is also a polysaccharide deacetylase (14). These roles in polysaccharide modification are consistent with the wall location of mannoproteins (147).The cell wall is a dynamic structure that undergoes constant remodeling through variation in the distribution of components and their cross-linking. This allows cells to maintain integrity through the extraordinary morphologic transformations of mating and cell division and to withstand challenges from external stresses such as variations in temperature and osmotic conditions. In C. neoformans wall morphology differs between serotypes (122) and changes upon mutation (122), during infection (49), and with culture age, nutrient status, and temperature (A. Yoneda & T.L. Doering, unpublished). These dramatic and coordinated changes must be exquisitely regulated, an area of active interest (38, 61, 87, 114, 140).The composition and synthesis of spore walls is a related but relatively unexplored area of cryptococcal research. The surfaces of these potentially infectious particles react with antibody to a capsule polysaccharide and with lectins that bind polymers of mannose and N-acetyl-glucosamine (16), suggesting that they share structural motifs with cell walls and capsule. Further analysis should illuminate the synthetic relationships between these entities.It has been assumed that cell wall components and organization in C. neoformans resemble those of model yeasts. However, whenever these processes have been examined in detail, intriguing differences have come to light. Given the fundamental importance of cell walls, the validation of β-glucan synthesis as a drug target, and the immunological role of cell wall mannoproteins, it is crucial to pursue the many unanswered questions in this area.In a clinical setting, the distinct halo appearance of the cryptococcal capsule (Figure 2b) is diagnostic for cryptococcal disease. In the research world the halo immediately stimulates questions about the nature of this striking material, its arrangement, and its biosynthesis. Beautiful scanning and thin-section EM (34, 136) and dramatic quick-freeze deep-etch images (119, 155) provide some hints, such as the intertwined fibers of capsular material emanating radially from close association with the cell wall (Figure 1), but many compelling questions remain.Almost all investigations of capsule polysaccharides have been based on material that is shed from the cell, most often using polysaccharides precipitated from culture supernatant fluids. This readily obtained material has been used for immunological studies (46, 103, 118) and structural analysis (33, 145) and to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have been key to the study of capsule (11, 44, 109). But does it represent the capsule as displayed upon cells? A recent report (53) addressed this question by physically comparing polysaccharides that were actively released from cells with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or by radiolysis with shed polysaccharides recovered from culture medium by filtration or precipitation. Although the samples differed in multiple properties, the relationship between shed material and cell-associated polysaccharides remains enigmatic. For example, cell-associated material released by irradiation was most similar to shed material recovered by filtration in terms of average molecular mass, radius of gyration, rigidity, and zeta potential. These two populations differed in mAb reactivity, however. By that criterion the radiation-released material was most similar to shed polysaccharide precipitated from culture medium. Notably, the composition of all four samples was similar when normalized to the mannose backbone, although the actively released populations included large quantities of glucose, presumably derived from the cell wall (53). Shed material somewhat resembles cell-associated polysaccharide microscopically (99), but defining their relationship may need to await mechanistic understanding of capsule assembly and release. Until then we must be careful to interpret experimental results in the context of the polysaccharide origin.Early studies of shed capsule indicated that it consisted of two large polysaccharides along with mannoproteins (31, 144). Concerted efforts by Cherniak and others defined the major capsule polysaccharide as a linear mannan substituted with glucuronic acid and xylose, descriptively named glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) (Figure 3a) (13, 32, 71). The degree of xylose substitution is strain dependent (33) (Figure 3a); acetylation of mannose in the GXM backbone also varies between strains and can exceed 60% (13, 79). GXM as shed from the cell is a large molecule (1–7 MDa) (32, 99) that comprises about 90% of the capsule mass (32). Mutant strains lacking surface GXM are avirulent (23), a central observation in the characterization of this polymer as a major virulence factor of C. neoformans. Immunological studies support the importance of GXM in the pathogenesis of cryptococcal infection (46, 102, 103).Capsule polysaccharide structures. (a) The six structural reporter groups of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) defined by Cherniak et al. (33). Mannose residues are α1,3 linked; xylose and glucuronic acid residues shown above the mannose backbone are β1,2 linked; xylose shown below the backbone is β,14 linked. Mannose acetylation (see text) is not shown. (b) The structure of glucuronoxylomannogalactan (GXMGal), formerly termed GalXM (69) (see sidebar). Trisaccharide side branches occur at every other galactose and may be substituted on 0–3 moieties (69); the two extreme cases are shown. Linkages are indicated on the diagram. In both panels all sugars are in pyranose form, and single polymer repeat units are shown. Shapes and colors follow the recommendations of the editors of Essentials of Glycobiology (see Related Resources).The second capsule polysaccharide is also a repeating polymer (Figure 3b), with a molecular weight of ~105 Da(32, 99). This polysaccharide was termed galactoxylomannan (GalXM) based on early composition analysis; we propose glucuronoxylomannogalactan (GXMGal) as a new name that reflects the recently revised structure of a galactose backbone with side chains containing mannose, xylose, and glucuronic acid (69) (see sidebar, A New Structure for a Familiar Polysaccharide) (Figure 3). Studies of GXMGal function have been limited because it is harder to purify than GXM (153), and mutants that produce altered GXMGal became available only recently (83, 105). Nonetheless, multiple reports suggest that this polymer also interferes significantly with the host immune response (21, 43, 118).A central challenge in deciphering cryptococcal capsule construction is that we do not yet know the overall scheme of polymer synthesis. The repeating structures of GXM and GXMGal raise the possibility that individual subunits are generated and then linked together (Figure 4a), reminiscent of bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis. Alternatively, extended segments of the polymer might be generated, either in mature form (as with the processive synthesis of some bacterial capsule polysaccharides) or as an extended precursor that is then sequentially modified (Figure 4b), analogous to biosynthesis of chitosan or mammalian heparan sulfate. Numerous variations on or combinations of these schemes can also be envisioned, although there is a dearth of definitive evidence for any synthetic model.Two possible models of capsule polymer synthesis. See text for details.One pertinent question is the precision of the polysaccharide repeats. NMR analysis of shed GXM has defined six structural reporter groups (Figure 3a), which occur in reproducible combinations in various strains (33). Importantly, such analysis cannot distinguish whether the observed structural heterogeneity results from the coexistence of multiple reporter groups within individual GXM molecules, from distinct molecules on the same cells, or from different cells within a population. This question was addressed by using mass spectroscopy to assess GXM fragments produced by acid hydrolysis. The data indicated that some repeats were underxylosylated, leading the authors to conclude that individual GXM molecules were created by linkage of different subunits and to suggest a model similar to Figure 4a (100). This study is certainly thought-provoking, although the observed microheterogeneity of the GXM structure could also arise during either processive synthesis or sequential modification of a glycan (72).Fully defining capsule synthesis presents a formidable challenge, due partly to the tremendous variability of GXM structures between strains (33). Capsules on cells within clonal populations may also differ, as evidenced by anti-GXM antibody reactivity and polysaccharide analysis (27, 56). Adding complexity, C.neoformans readily undergoes microevolution (30, 51, 70), potentially enabling environmental pressure to select specific capsule variants during infection (56). Reversible phenotypic switching has also been observed in multiple strains, with differences between switch variants including structural changes in GXM (76). A final twist is offered by the suggestion that cellular mechanisms may edit residues aberrantly incorporated into GXM (93). It is likely that these multiple levels of variability reflect differential regulation of the capsule synthetic machinery, a fascinating prospect that is largely unexplored.On the basis of the known composition of the capsule polysaccharides (Figure 3), we anticipate that their synthesis would require GDP-mannose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-xylose donors. UDP-glucuronic acid is generated from UDP-glucose by dehydrogenation; it is then either consumed in synthetic reactions or decarboxylated to UDP-xylose. Early experiments in C. neoformans and C. laurentii detected both activities (2, 3, 74); the C. neoformans enzymes responsible were subsequently cloned and expressed for biochemical studies (7, 8). Deletion of the gene encoding UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGD1) yields cells with no UDP-glucuronic acid or UDP-xylose (66), demonstrating that no other pathways exist for their synthesis. The mutants appear acapsular, although trace surface material is observed by EM, and they are stress- and temperature-sensitive, indicating poor cell wall integrity. They are also misshapen and are avirulent in animal models of cryptococcosis (66, 106).Identification of the cryptococcal UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (Uxs1p) by expression studies allowed independent examination of UDP-xylose formation (7). Deletion of UXS1 yielded cells lacking UDP-xylose, which accordingly synthesized GXM with no xylose residues. These cells bore capsules of reduced size with deformed fibers and were avirulent in animal models. However, they did not display the cell integrity problems of ugd1Δ cells, which lack both UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-xylose (66, 107). Those defects presumably result from alterations in other glycoconjugates that require UDP-glucuronic acid for synthesis.As part of a systematic mutagenesis and virulence study, Janbon and colleagues (108) deleted UGE1, which encodes a putative epimerase that generates UDP-galactose from UDP-glucose. Capsule polysaccharides of these mutants lacked galactose, suggesting the absence of GXMGal. Staining with anti-GXM mAbs indicated the capsules were enlarged, raising the possibility that GXMGal helps organize capsule structure. The mutants also demonstrated a defect in cell wall integrity, suggesting an independent role for galactose addition in wall construction (105), perhaps via protein modification (143). Finally, the authors noted aberrant organ colonization and proposed a role for GXMGal in this process (105).Synthesis of GDP mannose has not been studied directly, but one study addressed phosphomannose isomerase, a critical enzyme in mannose metabolism (152). This protein generates a precursor for the synthesis of GDP mannose; the latter is required for all forms of protein glycosylation as well as for GXM and GXMGal synthesis. Deletion of the corresponding gene yielded cells that were abnormally shaped, hypocapsular, and avirulent in animal models.Terminal galactofuranose is a minor component of GXMGal (77, 145). The cryptococcal protein responsible for synthesis of the corresponding donor molecule, UDP-galactofuranose, has been identified (12), but deletion of the corresponding gene produced no obvious phenotypic alterations besides the expected change in GXMGal components (H. Liu & T.L. Doering, unpublished data).Carbohydrate structures result from a complex interplay between glycosyltransferase activities, the levels of sugar donors, and acceptor availability. Further, glycosyltransferases are typically specific for both the reactants and the linkages created. Examination of capsule polysaccharide structures (Figure 3) suggests that a variety of glycosyltransferases are required for their synthesis (42), but to date only one has been demonstrated to act in this process (83). This sharp contrast with our more detailed understanding of cell wall synthesis is partly due to lack of precedent. S. cerevisiae, for example, does not use xylose or glucuronic acid and performs little galactosylation. It is also currently impossible to predict glycosylation activity from sequence data.The only enzyme proven to directly mediate capsule synthetic reactions in C. neoformans is a xylosyltransferase called Cxt1p, which was biochemically purified from cryptococcal membrane extracts (84). In vitro Cxt1p catalyzes UDP-xylose-dependent addition of xylose in β1,2-linkage to the reducing sugar of a mannose-α-1,3-mannose dimer (84). Dramatically, cxt1Δ mutants lacked all β1,2-linked xylose on GXMGal (Figure 3b), indicating that Cxt1p is solely responsible for this modification. The β1,3-linked xylose on GXMGal was also absent; although Cxt1p may catalyze linkage of this residue directly, it is more likely that the enzyme mediating β1,3-linked xylose addition requires the prior addition of the more proximal β1,2-linked xylose (Figure 3b), suggesting the temporal order of these two reactions. Beyond the striking lack of xylose in GXMGal, cxt1Δ lacked ~30% of the β1,2-linked xylose on its GXM (dominated in this strain by the M1 structural reporter group) (Figure 3a) (83). The partial loss suggests that multiple enzymes act in this synthetic step, a frequent theme in fungal glycan synthesis (85). The mutant also lacked all xylose on glycoinos-itolphosphoceramides, revealing Cxt1p as a fascinating trifunctional enzyme (20).The GXM backbone is highly 6-O-acetylated, a feature important for polysaccharide antigenicity (13, 31, 86). A mutant screen based on capsule reactivity with mAbs implicated CAS1 in GXM acetylation; this gene encodes a multimembrane-spanning domain protein with homology to glycosyltransferases. Although the specific function of Cas1p is not known, GXM in cas1Δ cells was not acetylated (79). An analysis of GXM structures in this work further suggested that acetylation follows side chain addition and occurs preferentially on unsubstituted mannose residues, with acetylation of glucuronylated mannose as a second choice. [GXMGal, which is also acetylated (145), was not examined.] Curiously, cas1Δ was hypervirulent compared with isogenic wild-type strains (79).Several additional enzyme activities identified in C. neoformans might participate in capsule synthesis. Deletion of the gene encoding an α1,3-mannosyltransferase (Cmt1p) did not yield a morphologic capsule defect, although structural analyses were not performed (136). Cmt1p may act in GXMGal synthesis, may be one of several functionally redundant enzymes, or may play an unrelated role in the cell. Another potential participant is Cps1p, a hyaluronic acid synthase that is required for virulence and whose product may act in capsule formation (22, 80). Additional glycosyltransferase activities detected in C. neoformans and C. laurentii (133, 148, 149) have not been purified or studied at the molecular level.The products of four CAP genes [CAP10, CAP59, CAP60, and CAP64 (23–26)], identified by complementation of acapsular mutants (75), are strong candidates for proteins with enzymatic roles in capsule synthesis. CAP64 and five homologs were implicated in GXM xylosylation and acetylation (104); one of these homologs copurified with Cmt1p. CAP60 and CAP59 are homologous to CMT1. CAP10 (along with four other cryptococcal genes) is highly homologous to CXT1 (84); one of the other homologs also encodes a functional xylosyltransferase (J.S. Klutts & T.L. Doering, unpublished data). Thus, although specific functions of the original CAP gene products have not been demonstrated, these data and their predicted structures suggest they participate directly in capsule construction, perhaps within multienzyme complexes.A critical question for understanding capsule construction is the site of synthesis. One potential location is within intracellular organelles, analogous to synthesis of cell wall mannan or plant pectin (4). Alternatively, capsule polymers could be synthesized at the cell surface, similar to bacterial polysaccharides, plant cellulose, or mammalian hyaluronan. Finally, steps in synthesis could be spatially separated, perhaps depending on polymer type, stage of synthesis, or regulatory signals. Indirect evidence that capsule synthesis occurs within membrane-bound organelles comes from studies of nucleotide sugar transport. Most nucleotide sugar donors are generated in the cytosol, while the eukaryotic enzymes that use them frequently act within membrane-bound organelles. Cells solve this topological problem with specific transporters to move sugar donors into appropriate compartments. A UDP-galactose transporter that was identified in C. neoformans by homology (105) has the expected transport activity (A. Ashikov, R. Gerardy-Schahn, & T.L. Doering, unpublished) and is required for GXMGal production and normal virulence in mice (105). Two GDP-mannose transporters were similarly identified in C. neoformans and shown to be functional; deletion of one of these produced hypocapsular cells with a defect in capsule induction (36). The requirement for these transporters to achieve normal capsule synthesis suggests that at least the back bones of GXM and GXMGal are made within membrane-bound organelles, although it remains formally possible that this effect is indirect (e.g., via glycosylated enzymes). UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-xylose transporters have not been studied, although the genome includes candidate genes (15).A direct route to identifying the site of capsule synthesis is to localize proteins involved in this process. However, many of the enzymes required act upstream of multiple synthetic processes and would not serve as specific markers for capsule formation; Cxt1p, the only molecularly confirmed capsule glycosyltransferase, has not yet been localized. As an alternative approach, previous investigations have sought to localize the capsule polymer itself, proposing a variety of locations and structures for synthesis (reviewed in Reference 157). We recently took a cell biological approach to this question and generated a cryptococcal mutant that is conditionally defective in classical secretion. Reducing secretory vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane (Figure 5a arrow) led to vesicle accumulation; immuno-EM indicated that these vesicles contain cargo that reacts with anti-GXM mAbs (Figure 6), suggesting that significant steps in capsule synthesis occur intracellularly (157).Models of Cryptococcus neoformans vesicular traffic. (a) Vesicles formed via the classical secretory pathway fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents outside the cell. (b) Vesicles formed by plasma membrane blebbing are released from the cell surface. (c) Vesicles formed within intracellular membrane-bound structures are released intact at the cell surface. Drawing is not to scale. See text for details.A Cryptococcus neoformans secretion mutant accumulates vesicles that contain capsular material. A section through a new bud was labeled with anti-GXM monoclonal antibody and gold-conjugated antimouse antibody. Similar sections of wild-type buds (not shown) demonstrate only occasional vesicles with antibody labeling (157). Reprinted, with permission, from Reference 157.Intracellular synthesis of even the largest GXM polymers is conceptually possible, as their calculated volume can be accommodated in typical post-Golgi vesicles (T.L. Doering, unpublished calculations). Measured radii of gyration of shed or actively released GXM (53) support this assessment, and several studies hint that it occurs. Thin-section EM images show material that appears similar to capsule fibers present in secretory vesicles fusing with the plasma membrane (Figure 7a). Consistent with this image, the pattern of deposition of colloidal gold-labeled mAbs to GXM suggests binding to linear fibers, both on the cell surface and in secretory vesicles within the cytosol (Figure 7b). These images do not definitively establish this model, but they provide intriguing visual evidence that capsule fibers are generated internally.Images suggesting intracellular synthesis of capsule fibers. (a) Transmission EM shows intracellular vesicles (arrowheads) fusing with the cell surface; the vesicles contain fibers that are morphologically similar to the extracellular capsule fibers. (b) Image prepared as in Figure 6, showing a linear labeling pattern (arrowheads) on both vesicle contents and external capsule fibers. Panel a is reprinted, with permission, from Reference 66.Imaginative approaches have been used to examine the elaborate capsule architecture, with several themes emerging from the data. First, the capsule varies in porosity, as demonstrated by diffusion into the capsule of sized populations of beads (59). This physiologic heterogeneity is complex, as indicated by variable porosity at the site of emerging buds (119) and growth-dependent differences in zones of bead or antibody exclusion (59). Related to this theme is the emerging concept that concentric regions of the capsule differ in physical properties. This is supported by variable patterns of allowed permeation and binding of anti-GXM mAbs and Fab fragments (59, 97) and by density measurements (59). These results are echoed by studies of complement binding to capsule, which is also restricted to specific zones of the structure, depending on the serum source (58, 161).Further support for the existence of distinct capsule regions is offered by DMSO release of capsule from cells; such studies consistently show an internal DMSO-resistant region that remains cell associated (18, 59). More recently, consecutive bursts of γ-irradiation have been used to sequentially release populations of capsule, suggesting the existence of multiple capsule regions of similar composition but different density (18, 97). These studies assume that the capsule layer released by each burst is the most superficial one; it is conceivable that more susceptible regions are internal but this has not been directly addressed.Capsule architecture is dynamic, like that of the cell wall. For example, capsule growth may be observed in vitro in capsule-inducing media (160) or as dramatic enlargement in animal tissues (125, 160). This expansion is likely relevant to pathogenesis, as large capsules inhibit host phagocytosis (41) and cells unable to induce capsule formation exhibit reduced virulence (36). The capsules of cells that have been grown in vitro under inducing conditions are more dense than those from cells with small uninduced capsules (59). Capsule density also increases with time of induction, as assessed by quick-freeze deep-etch imaging and susceptibility to irradiation (97, 119). The capsules on cells isolated from animals are similar in size to those on in vitro–induced cells, but the in vivo–grown capsules are even more dense and have an extended DMSO-resistant zone (59). This finding must be considered when in vitro induction is used to model in vivo events.Most studies of capsule arrangement have focused on GXM because it is the more abundant polymer and because mAbs to it are readily available. mAbs to GXMGal were reported in 1990 but are no longer available (146); an exciting recent development is the production of polyclonal antibodies to this polymer (40). Immunolocalization with these antibodies placed GXMGal at the cell wall in acapsular cells and the outer capsule in wild-type cells (40).Our understanding of capsule architecture is hampered by the absence of information about the physical interactions of the two capsule polymers and whether either is branched or otherwise modified. Nonetheless, creative and elegant studies in this area have given us an excellent foundation on which to build with newly available methods and reagents.Evidence reviewed above suggests that at least some capsule components are manufactured within the cell, although the structure itself is extracellular. This raises the related questions of how capsule material exits the cell, and how it is incorporated as the structure grows. Studies of C. neoformans mutants impaired in classical secretion show that secretory vesicle contents react with anti-GXM mAbs (157). The membranes of such vesicles, by definition, fuse with the plasma membrane; this would release the vesicle contents, which were produced in secretory organelles, outside the cell, where they would be available for incorporation into growing capsule (Figure 5a).Nonclassical secretory pathways could also export capsule components from an intracellular site of synthesis. Heterogeneous membrane-bound vesicles in the supernatant fraction of cultured cryptococcal cells have been reported; these fractions contain anti-GXM mAb-reactive material as well as membrane lipids and proteins of both cytosolic and membrane origin (128, 129). There are two ways that cells can release intact vesicles. In one, the plasma membrane blebs outward, capturing cytosolic material to form extracellular vesicles (Figure 5b) (110). In the other, vesicles may be generated within another intracellular membranous structure, as with formation of mammalian multivesicular bodies (141). When the outer compartment fuses with the surface, the inner vesicles are released (Figure 5c). Multivesicular structures in C. neoformans have been observed (128, 138, 139; A. Yoneda & T.L. Doering, unpublished data), but their contents have not been probed for capsule components; they could be related to other processes observed in C. neoformans such as autophagy (47, 113). Vesicles released intact from cells, whether produced via blebbing or multivesicular body formation (Figure 5b,c), would have contents that are derived from the cytosol (47). In contrast, classical secretory vesicles (Figure 5a) bear lumenal components. The anti-GXM mAb-reactive cargo in these classes of vesicles must therefore originate in distinct compartments and may include different populations of capsule-related molecules.When interpreting all these studies we must be aware of the limits of mAb localization techniques. These Abs have been powerful tools for the study of C. neoformans, and several have been analyzed in detail (44, 86, 109, 159), but the specific epitopes they recognize are not known and may not be exclusive to capsule components. Thus, although antibody binding is consistent with the presence of capsule material, it might also indicate the presence of other cellular glycoconjugates with shared structural motifs (20). Further, antibody binding does not indicate the size or composition of the polymers present. Direct analysis of vesicle contents will ultimately be needed to illuminate the location of capsule biogenesis and the export of capsule polysaccharides.Once capsule materials exit the cell, they must be incorporated into the existing structure. One circumstance in which this must occur is new bud formation. Capsule around buds may differ in arrangement from that of mature cells, but it is clearly present on the earliest identifiable budding structures (34, 119) (Figure 1). In pulse-chase studies of fluorescently tagged C. neoformans we demonstrated de novo formation of cell wall and capsule around nascent buds (119), studies later reproduced by others (162). These experiments demonstrate the polarized delivery of polysaccharide components to the bud site, consistent with observations on cell wall synthesis in S. cerevisiae.Another occasion for capsule assembly is the growth of existing capsule on mature cells. In a study based on antibody labeling, pulse-chase EM-autoradiography, and quick-freeze deep-etch imaging, we suggested that new capsule material is incorporated close to the cell wall, displacing existing material outward while intercalating with existing fibers to increase the overall density of the structure (119). Other investigators noted that complement used to covalently label proximal capsule regions was not displaced distally over time; they concluded that addition of new material to the capsule instead occurs at the distal edge, while noting that intercalation throughout the structure is likely (162). In this study radiolabeling indicated that newly incorporated xylose was most susceptible to capsule release by irradiation (162), supporting a model of progressive capsule cross-linking (119), but the capsular site of radiolabel incorporation was not assessed.The reagents potentially complicate interpretation of both studies of capsule expansion. For example, even low amounts of antibody might alter the conformation and arrangement of capsule fibers; antibody may also redistribute, although this was not observed in budding studies (119, 162). Complement binds the cell wall in addition to the capsule (162) and could label an inner capsule layer that is not displaced while antibody-binding layers translocate outward; this model is supported by the observation of concentric rings of complement and antibody binding (162). Finally, both investigations used capsule induced in vitro, although this differs substantially from capsule expanded in vivo (59). One fascinating study that was performed in vivo suggests a rapid shift in capsule antigenicity during infection, with a later epitope present in an extracellular cloud suggestive of released exopolysaccharide surrounding an earlier epitope (27); this observation certainly warrants further investigation.Multiple mechanisms likely act in concert to coordinate capsule expansion and the concomitant density increase, potentially regulating both polysaccharide arrangement and the characteristics of the polymers themselves. We have examined the gel migration of anti-GXM mAb-reactive material that is shed as cells are cultured in inducing conditions. The electromobility of this polysaccharide is inversely related to capsule radius (158). The electromobility change upon induction is independent of the presence of cations, suggesting it is not due to the charge-based aggregation that occurs in concentrated GXM preparations and is hypothesized to influence capsule assembly (98, 111). The simplest interpretation of these results is that cells synthesize GXM molecules of greater length in response to conditions that stimulate capsule expansion. However, this behavior could also reflect other modifications such as branching, cross-linking, or substitution. These results offer an intriguing model for capsule enlargement, which will be interesting to test in material actively released from cells.Why is study of the cryptococcal cell wall and capsule so compelling? Is it their key roles in cell integrity and pathogenesis? Is it because each is a fungal-specific structure needed for C. neoformans to succeed in overcoming the host? Is it the hope that investigating their synthetic pathways might elucidate other important areas of biology? Whatever the appropriate combination of reasons, researchers in multiple areas will benefit from these investigations. Even while the wall and capsule differ in detail from other extracellular polymers, they are similar in concept and share fundamental questions of topology and synthesis. This has allowed research in Cryptococcus to benefit from groundbreaking work in other systems; this fungus has now begun to return the favor by inspiring new methods and experimental approaches that may ultimately be broadly applicable.Structural analysis of the galactose-containing capsule polysaccharide is difficult owing to its complex structure and the nonstoichiometric glycosylation of some residues. Despite these challenges, Cherniak and colleagues (145) used NMR to define this structure, based on a composition of xylose, mannose, and galactose. While studying capsule synthesis, we (83) generated a mutant (cxt1Δ) that produces a form of this polysaccharide without xylose, greatly simplifying the NMR spectra (69). During analyses of these spectra we discovered inconsistencies between our data and the published structure. All our studies (compositional and methylation analysis, NMR, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) were consistent with the unexpected presence of d-glucuronic acid and yielded a revised structure in which the galactose backbone is modified with side branches composed of galactose, mannose, xylose, and glucuronic acid. (The original structure had xylose in place of the glucuronic acid residue, but was otherwise identical.) We propose that this polymer be renamed glucuronoxylomannogalactan (GXMGal) instead of galactoxylomannan (GalXM) (69). GXMGal better represents the polysaccharide in terms of its overall structure (a galactan, not a mannan) and its substituents (now shown to include glucuronic acid), making it both accurate and consistent with the nomenclature used for GXM.The cell wall and capsule of C. neoformans are crucial for the success of this pathogen. Understanding their synthesis may help identify targets for greatly needed new therapies.Cryptococcal cell wall glucans include a higher proportion of α1,3-linked structures than is found in S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans; these polymers are required for capsule association with the cell.Chitosan, the deacetylated form of chitin, is abundant in C. neoformans cell walls and is required for normal cell integrity and separation. Formation of chitin and chitosan may be physically linked, adding a layer to the already complex synthesis of fungal chitin.The physical properties of GXM, the major capsule component, depend on whether it has been shed or actively released and on the method of isolation employed. This must be kept in mind during interpretation of studies involving this material.Application of both biochemical and molecular approaches has advanced our understanding of capsule synthesis. In a convergence of these methods, sequence homology to enzymes that have been biochemically identified suggests that the proteins encoded by the original CAP genes identified by Kwon-Chung and colleagues, along with many of their homologs, likely act directly in glycan synthesis.mAb localization indicates that GXM-related material is associated with both intracellular and extracellular vesicles, suggesting various models of capsule formation. These exciting observations must be tempered with the recognition that structural motifs found in capsule polysaccharides may occur in other glycoconjugates, as has already been demonstrated by a shared synthetic motif that directs xylose transfer.What are the structures of the N-linked and O-linked glycans in C. neoformans, and which are present in the highly immunogenic cell wall proteins? How do these structures relate to those of capsule polysaccharides, and can they provide synthetic clues to the synthesis of those polymers?What and where is the machinery for capsule glycan synthesis? Do the relevant enzymes participate in other glycan synthetic pathways? Do they occur in multienzyme complexes? How are they regulated?Are GXM and GXMGal formed on primer molecules or de novo, and how does elongation occur? Are these polymers branched? Do they cross-link with other molecules of the same type, to each other, or to other cellular components? Does the cell degrade capsule polymers? What is the mechanism of cell association and release? How are these processes controlled?Capsule architecture is complex and dynamic, with properties of this extraordinary structure varying spatially, temporally, and with growth conditions. What is the detailed arrangement of this structure and the mechanism for its construction? How is synthesis of the various zones of the capsule regulated in response to physiological conditions?Why are cryptococcal cells resistant to the echinocandin antifungal compounds? What can be done to enable use of these effective drugs to help patients with cryptococcal disease? What other avenues of cell wall and capsule synthesis can be explored to improve current therapy?I am grateful for the collegiality, creativity, and friendship of the many researchers who have contributed to the study of C. neoformans, and sincerely regret that lack of space prevents me from citing all the relevant primary work and excellent reviews.

PMC2885077,Production of Chitooligosaccharides and Their Potential Applications in Medicine,False,"Chitooligosaccharides (CHOS) are homo- or heterooligomers of N-acetylglucosamine and D-glucosamine. CHOS can be produced using chitin or chitosan as a starting material, using enzymatic conversions, chemical methods or combinations thereof. Production of well-defined CHOS-mixtures, or even pure CHOS, is of great interest since these oligosaccharides are thought to have several interesting bioactivities. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these bioactivities is of major importance. However, so far in-depth knowledge on the mode-of-action of CHOS is scarce, one major reason being that most published studies are done with badly characterized heterogeneous mixtures of CHOS. Production of CHOS that are well-defined in terms of length, degree of N-acetylation, and sequence is not straightforward. Here we provide an overview of techniques that may be used to produce and characterize reasonably well-defined CHOS fractions. We also present possible medical applications of CHOS, including tumor growth inhibition and inhibition of TH2-induced inflammation in asthma, as well as use as a bone-strengthener in osteoporosis, a vector for gene delivery, an antibacterial agent, an antifungal agent, an anti-malaria agent, or a hemostatic agent in wound-dressings. By using well-defined CHOS-mixtures it will become possible to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these bioactivities.Chitin is a linear polysaccharide consisting of β(1→4) linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc; A) residues. It is often considered the second most abundant polysaccharide in nature, after cellulose, and occurs mainly as a structural component in the cell walls of fungi and yeasts and in the exoskeletons of insects and arthropods (e.g., crabs, lobsters and shrimps). Chitin is insoluble in water and exists mainly in two crystalline polymorphic forms, α and β. α-Chitin consists of sheets of tightly packed alternating parallel and antiparallel chains [1] and is found in the exoskeleton of arthropods, in insects and in fungal and yeast cell walls. In β-chitin the chains are arranged in parallel [2]. β-chitin occurs less frequently in nature than α-chitin, but can be extracted from squid pens.Chitosan can be prepared from chitin by partial deacetylation, and is a heteropolymer of GlcNAc and d-glucosamine (GlcN; D) residues. Unlike chitin, chitosan is soluble in dilute aqueous acid solutions. The name chitosan refers to a continuum of soluble polymeric chitin derivatives that can be described and classified according to the fraction of N-acetylated residues (FA) or degree of N-acetylation (DA), the degree of polymerization (DP) or the molecular weight (MW), the molecular weight distribution (PD, for PolyDispersity), and the pattern of N-acetylation (PA) or sequence. Chitosan exhibits a variety of interesting physicochemical and biological properties. This, in combination with its non-toxicity, biocompatibility and biodegradability, makes chitosan suitable for use in numerous applications in agriculture, cosmetics, water treatment and medicine [3–7].Chitooligosaccharides (CHOS) are oligomers prepared from chitosan either chemically or enzymatically. Chitosan can be converted to CHOS by acid hydrolysis or by enzymatic hydrolysis with glycosyl hydrolases like chitinases or chitosanases. The FA, MW, PD and PA of the resulting CHOS-mixture depend on the chitosan and the specificity of the enzyme used. As described below, product mixtures can be enriched for certain compounds by optimizing the chitosan-enzyme combination.There is ample literature concerning the biological effects of chitosans, but relatively little is known about the effects of CHOS [6,8], and the mechanisms behind observed bioactivities are generally poorly understood. CHOS are primarily thought to interact with proteins that either act on chitin (e.g., chitinases) or that are supposed to bind to and detect chitin. When it comes to medicine, there are indications that CHOS may be developed as drugs against asthma [9–12], antibacterial agents [13], ingredients in wound-dressings [14,15] and vectors in gene-therapy [16,17]. Furthermore, according to the literature, CHOS may reduce metastasis and tumor-growth in cancer [18–20], increase bone-strength in osteoporosis [21,22] and could be used to inhibit chitinases in Plasmodium parasites and thereby prevent malaria [23]. Several other potential effects of CHOS have been described, including immune modulatory effects [24], anti-fungal activities [25,26] and a lowering effect on serum glucose levels in diabetics [27]. In the context of this review, it should be noted that some of the biological effects reported for chitosan in fact may be due to CHOS, which emerge when chitosan is degraded by naturally occurring hydrolytic enzymes.So far, most of the research on bioactivities of CHOS has been done with badly defined mixtures containing CHOS of various FA, MW, PD and PA. Moreover, the CHOS fractions appearing in the literature are derived from various sources of chitosan that are not always traceable and that have been characterized to only a limited extent. Clearly, when using complex mixtures of CHOS in bioassays, it is difficult to know which molecule/molecules are causing the effects. Furthermore, reproducibility can be an issue. All in all, while interesting biological activities have been observed, there is little information on the molecular properties that confer bioactivity to a particular CHOS.In this review we provide an overview of some of the most promising applications of CHOS. Furthermore, we describe current knowledge on how well-defined mixtures of CHOS can be prepared and characterized. It is possible to prepare CHOS from chitosan by using different physical methods, like hydrothermal [28], microwave [29], ultrasonication [30] and gamma-rays [31], but these methods are not optimal for creating well-defined CHOS-mixtures and will not be dealt with in this review. Chemical methods using acid [32,33], H2O2 [34] or NaNO2 [35], can yield CHOS and one of these methods is described briefly below. We will, however, focus our review on the enzymatic production of CHOS, and on further separation and purification methods for producing well-defined mixtures.It is possible to isolate chitosan directly from the cell walls of certain fungi, but commercially available chitosans are usually prepared from chitin in a heterogeneous deacetylation process. Chitosans will in this paper be defined as proposed by Roberts [36], i.e., according to their solubility at acidic pH-values. This distinguishes clearly between chitins and chitosans, although some controversy may exist when discussing chitin oligomers (N-acetyl-CHOS) and chitosan oligomers (CHOS). To avoid this problem, we restrict the terms chitin and chitosan to polymers with more than 100 sugar units.Chitosans can be prepared from chitin by two fundamentally different methods, i.e., homogeneous [37] and heterogeneous deacetylation. In the homogeneous deacetylation process, the chitin is dissolved in an alkali solution during the deacetylation process (at low temperature and using excessive stirring). In the heterogeneous deacetylation process, the chitin is kept insoluble in a hot alkali solution, meaning that this is a two-phase process. Chitosans with FA varying from 0 to about 65% can be prepared by homogeneous deacetylation of chitin [37]. There is little controversy regarding the distribution (PA) of the two monomers in these chitosans, which have been found to have a random distribution of the GlcNAc and GlcN units, i.e., according to Bernoullian distribution [38–40]. There is, however, more controversy about the distribution of sugar units in chitosan prepared by heterogeneous deacetylation procedures. Weinhold et al. [41] studied the N-acetylation patterns of 32 different chitosans of various FA, using a previously described NMR-method [39], most of them prepared by heterogenous deacetylation, and found a close to random distributions for all samples. Although this recent study indicates that the PA in chitosans prepared by heterogenous deacetylation is more random than previously assumed, it should be kept in mind that the NMR-method is only capable of determining an average distribution, meaning that certain block patterns may in fact exist.The annual production of chitin in nature has been estimated to approximately 1010–1011 tons per year [42]. The amounts of chitin, chitosan and their derivatives that are used/produced in industrial processes [43] have been estimated to be about 30 000 metric tons for chitin and about 10,000 metric tons for chitosan in 2007 [44]. Most of the chitin is used as raw material for the production of the monosaccharide GlcN, which is the number one dietary supplement in the USA, used for pain relief of osteoarthritis [43].Enzymatic depolymerization of chitin and chitosan involves chitinases and chitosanases, respectively (Figure 1). These enzymes hydrolyze the glycoside bonds between the sugars and are thus glycoside hydrolases (GH). Such GH are classified in the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes database (CAZy) [45–48] that provides a continuously updated list of the GH families and, since a few years, also other families of carbohydrate-active enzymes such as glycosyl transferases and carbohydrate esterases. The CAZy classification is based on the amino acid sequence, which gives very useful information since sequence and structure, and hence mechanism, are related. It should be noted that the CAZy system does not take substrate and product activities into account a priori. The same applies to enzyme properties such as exo- versus endo-binding, processivity, and the presence of additional modules that may improve substrate-binding. All these properties are not taken into account either. The CAZy classification is purely based on amino acid sequence similarities and, indeed, several GH classes contain enzymes acting on a variety of substrates. Many GH enzymes have one or more carbohydrate binding domains in addition to their catalytic domain (Figures 1 and ​and2).2). These are referred to as carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) and are also classified in the CAZy database.Structures of the enzymes discussed in detail in this review. Figure 1a and 1b show, respectively, ChiA and ChiB from Serratia marcescens. Figure 1c shows hevamine, a plant family 18 chitinase whose structure is thought to resemble the (unknown) structure of the catalytic domain of ChiC from Serratia marcescens. Figure 1d shows ChiG from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Figure 1e shows CsnN174, a family 46 chitosanase from Streptomyces sp. N174, which, judged from sequence similarity, is highly similar to Csn88 from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The side chains of the catalytic acid and of the catalytic base/nucleophile are shown.Schematic drawing of subsites, chitin binding domains and proposed orientation of polymeric substrates in ChiA and ChiB.

[56], and is reproduced with permission from Wiley-Blackwell.Chitinases occur in families GH18 and GH19 and both these classes almost exclusively contain these enzymes. Chitinases have the unique ability to hydrolyze A-A bonds and this property discriminates these enzymes from chitosanases. However, as described below, chitinases are perfectly capable of hydrolyzing chitosan, albeit to different extents. Chitinases do not hydrolyze D-D bonds.Enzymes with chitosanase activity have been found in GH families 5, 7, 8, 46, 75 and 80. GH7 is a cellulase family and in a very few cases chitosanase activity has been detected as a side activity of these enzymes. GH5 contains a variety of enzymatic activities, including chitosanases, cellulases, licheninases, mannanase and xylanases. Again, chitosanase activity has been detected in only a very few cases, and the activity seems to be a side activity of cellulases. In GH8, enzymes annotated as chitosanases occur more frequently (next to e.g., cellulases and xylanases), and this family seems to contain a few true chitosanases [49]. The other three families, GH46, GH75 and GH80, exclusively contain chitosanases. Families GH75 and GH80 have only a few members and there is no structural and only very little functional information available for these enzymes. The best studied chitosanases, by far, are those belonging to family 46 [50–52] (Figure 1).Based on their substrate specificity towards chitosan, chitosanases have been classified into subclasses I, II and III [53]. Chitosanases in subclass I can hydrolyze A-D and D-D linkages, subclass II enzymes can hydrolyze D-D linkages only, whereas subclass III enzymes can hydrolyze D-A and D-D linkages. Subclass I enzymes have been found in both families 46 and 75 [54,55]. In family 46, subclass III enzymes have also been found [52].The hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkage is a nucleophilic substitution at the anomeric carbon, and can lead to either retention or inversion of the anomeric configuration [57,58]. Both hydrolysis reactions take place through general acid catalysis, and require a pair of carboxylic acids at the enzyme’s active site. One carboxylic acid is acting as a proton donor, facilitating leaving group departure, and the other acts as a base (inverting mechanism) or as a nucleophile (retaining mechanism). In both mechanisms, the position of the proton donor is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the glycosidic oxygen. The inverting mechanism (also called the single displacement mechanism) is a “one-step” reaction, where the protonation of the glycosidic oxygen occurs simultaneously with a nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon by an activated water molecule. This water molecule is located between a carboxylic group and the anomeric carbon and it is activated by the carboxylic group that acts as a base. Since the water molecule approaches the anomeric carbon from the side of the catalytic base, this mechanism leads to inversion of the anomeric configuration. Chitosanases belonging to families GH46, GH75 and GH80 and family 19 chitinases use the inverting mechanism [45,47,49,54,59–61].The retaining mechanism (also referred to as the double displacement mechanism) is a two-step reaction, were the first step involves the protonation of the glycosidic oxygen (by the catalytic acid) and a congruent nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon atom by the nucleophile (the second carboxylic acid). This attack leads to breakage of the glycosidic linkage and the formation of a covalent linkage between the anomeric carbon and the catalytic nucleophile [62]. Subsequently, this intermediate is hydrolyzed by a water molecule that approaches the anomeric carbon from a position close to that of the original glycosidic oxygen, leading to retention of the anomeric carbon configuration.Family 18 chitinases use a special variant of the double displacement mechanism, referred to as the substrate-assisted double displacement mechanism. Here, the carbonyl oxygen atom from the N-acetylgroup of the sugar bound in subsite -1 act as the nucleophile, leading to formation of an oxazolinium ion intermediate. Because of this involvement of the N-acetylgroup in catalysis, productive substrate-binding of chitosan and chitosan oligomers to family 18 chitinases requires that a GlcNAc is bound in the -1 subsite [63–67].Chitinases and chitosanases can have endo- or exo-activity, where both the endo- and exo-mode of action can be combined with processivity. Processive enzymes will not release the substrate after one cleavage, but remain associated with the substrate so that a new cleavage can take place as the polymer substrate slides through the substrate-binding cleft (Figure 2). Processivity is difficult to analyze when degrading insoluble substrates such as chitin, but can be studied when using chitosan as substrate [56,64,68,69]. Whereas processivity generally is considered to be favorable for the hydrolysis of crystalline substrates, processivity has been shown to reduce enzyme efficiency towards soluble and more accessible polymeric substrates such as chitosan [69,70]. Thus, for the industrial production of CHOS, the use of non-processive enzyme variants may be beneficial in some cases.Even though chitin and chitin synthases have not been found in humans, we produce two family 18 chitinases with chitinolytic activity [71]. In addition, two highly homologous proteins named chi-lectins and a homologous protein called oviductin are expressed. These proteins lack enzymatic activity while having retained the typical features of family 18 enzymes, including carbohydrate binding to the active site [71].One of the human chitinases, called chitotriosidase (HCHT), is synthesized and secreted as a 50-kDa two-domain protein in human macrophages [72]. A significant portion of produced enzyme is routed to lysosomes and processed into a 39-kDa isoform, lacking the C-terminal chitin-binding domain [73]. HCHT was first discovered as a marker for Gaucher disease [72], but has later been associated with several diseases like malaria [74], fungal infections such as candidosis [75], sarcoidosis [76,77], cardiovascular risk [78], coronary artery disease [79], primary prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia [80], nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [81], multiple sclerosis [82], and Niemann-Pick disease [83]. The other chitinase, acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase), is also synthesized as a two-domain 50 kDa protein containing a 39 kDa N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal chitin-binding domain. AMCase is found in the stomach [84], in tears [85], sinus mucosa [86], and lungs [12,84]. Chitinases play important roles in the antiparasite responses of lower life forms [87–89]. Both HCHT and AMCase are believed to play similar roles in the human immune defense system, being a part of antiparasitic responses [10,87,90].The two chi-lectins are associated with numerous diseases. YKL-40 (alternatively called HCgp39 or CHI3L1) is observed in elevated levels for patients with severe asthma [91], cardiovascular disease and diabetes [92], cancer [93], peritoneal endometriosis [94], morbid obesity [95], osteoarthritis [96], and liver fibrosis [97]. The other chi-lectin YKL-39 (or CHI3L2) has been observed up-regulated in osteoarthritic chondrocytes [98] and osteoarthritic cartilage [99]. The loss of hydrolytic activity in these chi-lectins is due to replacement of the catalytic acid (E) and the adjacent aspartic acid (D) in the conserved DxxDxDxE motif with Ala and Leu or Ser and Ile for YKL-40 and YKL-39, respectively. The chi-lectins have retained their ability to bind CHOS [100] and this may be a feature underlying some of the alleged biological effects of CHOS.Family 18 chitinases are of particular interest, because they are abundant in nature, are crucial in the life cycles of numerous plague and pest organisms, and because they occur in humans themselves. Because of the substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism of GH18 enzymes, catalysis requires that a GlcNAc is bound to the -1 subsite. CHOS that preferably bind in such a way that a GlcN ends up in the crucial -1 subsite will act as an inhibitor. Sugar binding to the -1 subsite leads to an energetically unfavorable distortion [101] which involves the N-acetylgroup [66,67] and which may amount to an unfavorable ΔG as high as ~8 kcal/mol [102]. Although this has not yet been substantiated by experimental data, it seems plausible that binding of GlcN in the -1 subsite in fact could be energetically less unfavourable than binding of a GlcNAc. Thus, binding of a GlcN would be non-productive, but perhaps stronger than binding of a GlcNAc. This shows that the idea of developing partially deacetylated CHOS as inhibitors for family 18 chitinases is worth pursuing. Indeed, the validity of this idea has been substantiated by an early study by Peter and co-workers [103] as well as by more recent work [104,105].For chitinase B of Serratia marcescens, the -2 subsite has a strong preference for an GlcNAc [67]. The oxygen atom in the acetamidogroup of the -2 sugar forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with Trp 403 and Gln 407, whereas the methyl group packs tightly in an apolar environment provided by the side chains of Tyr 292 and Ile 337. Thus, the -2 subsite of this enzyme seems optimized for strong binding of an GlcNAc, which is not surprising taking into account that the positive effects of binding sugars in subsites adjacent to the -1 subsite is needed to “pull” the -1 sugar in its distorted conformation [106]. Indeed, one has observed non-productive binding by a DADAA oligomer bound from subsites -3 to +2 in chitinase B [104].CHOS being based on the substrate, hold a tremendous advantage in being very specific inhibitors towards chitinases, and hence not likely to interfere with other enzymatic systems. Moreover, the binding strength of the CHOS based inhibitor, an important parameter, can be tuned simply by increasing the chain length of the CHOS or by coupling additional groups to the reducing end.In addition to its natural substrate, the glycosidic linkage of certain bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans, lysozyme may also hydrolyze chitin and chitosans [107]. In very early work, Amano and Ito [107] studied oligomers formed upon lysozyme degradation of an FA = 0.32 chitosan, and identified the fully N-acetylated trimer and tetramer together with the partially N-acetylated oligomers AAD, DAA, AAAD, ADAA and ADAD among the oligomeric products. Later, Vårum et al. [108] studied lysozyme degradation of a highly N-acetylated chitosan (FA = 0.65). In this study, NMR-spectroscopy of the degradation products was used to determine the identities of the newly formed reducing and non-reducing ends. This methodology, which has later been used to characterize chitinases (see below), provided insight into the cleavage specificities of the enzyme, i.e., its preference for cleaving A-A, A-D, D-A and/or D-D linkages in chitosans. Some information on the identity of the nearest neighbors to the new reducing and non-reducing ends could also be obtained.So far, there are no robust enzymatic methods for the production of chitosan that could provide an alternative to the current chemical production methods. In principle, chitin deacetylases could be used to produce chitosan [109–113]. These enzymes hydrolyze the N-acetyl linkage and convert GlcNAc to GlcN. However, the insolubility and crystallinity of the chitin substrate forms a major hurdle for this approach. Chitin deacetylases could also be used to modify the N-acetylation pattern of CHOS, but this route has so far remained unexplored.Although there are routes for chemical conversion of chitosan to CHOS [7] (see below), even CHOS with specific DP and PA, enzyme technology probably is the most promising approach. The specificity of chitosan-degrading enzymes has traditionally been studied by extensive enzymatic degradation of the polymer and subsequent isolation and characterization of the resulting oligomers. More recently, studies with chitinases have shown that the kinetics of the degradation reactions is such that product profiles change considerably during the hydrolysis reaction. Because the enzymes have very different binding affinities for different sequences on the substrate, reactions show multiphasic kinetics, and the product mixtures obtained at the end of each of these phases differ considerably. Another important issue is processivity; degradation processes may change during a reaction, from initial mainly processive hydrolysis of polymeric chains to non-processive hydrolysis of intermediate products as the polymeric material becomes exhausted. All in all, this means that the choice of the starting chitosan, the choice of the enzyme, and the choice of the processing time all affect the outcome of the enzymatic conversion process and that there are ample opportunities to manipulate this outcome [114]. This is illustrated by several studies on enzymatic degradation of chitosans [56,60,107,114–117], some of which are discussed in detail below. Structures of the enzymes discussed below are shown in Figure 1, whereas Table 1 shows some key properties.Some properties of the five enzymes that are specifically discussed in this review.The degradation of chitosan by the family 18 chitinases, ChiA, ChiB and ChiC, from Serratia marcescens has been studied in much detail [56,64,69,118]. Figure 3 shows the size-distribution of oligomers obtained upon degradation of a highly N-acetylated chitosan (FA = 0.65) to various extents of degradation (α). For ChiA and ChiB, the product profiles obtained during the initial phase of the degradation show a dominance of even-numbered oligomers, which is indicative of processive action [56,64,68]. This product pattern is due to the fact that enzyme-ligand complexes where there is a GlcN bound to the -1 subsite is not productive (in the case of family 18 chitinases). If the enzyme is processive, the enzyme will slide by two sugar units at the time, until a productive complex is formed [the primary condition being that there is an GlcNAc bound in the -1 subsite (see Sørbotten et al. [64] and Eijsink et al. [68] for a more detailed discussion)]. Consequently, while the first product of an enzyme-substrate association may have any length, every subsequent product will be even-numbered. In the case of chitin, all these products would be dimers; in the case of chitosan, these products may be longer even-numbered oligomers. Later during the reaction, the dominance of even-numbered oligomers disappears because there are no longer substrate molecules left and the enzyme is primarily involved in rebinding and further cleavage of oligomers from the preceding processive phase (see Figure 3). For example, an oligomer such as ADADAA that could emerge during processive degradation by ChiB can be converted by this same enzyme to ADA and DAA upon rebinding in a mode that was not explored during the processive phase, where the substrate moves by two sugars at the time (see Horn et al. [56] and Eijsink et al. [68] for a more extensive discussion and explanation).Degradation of chitosan (FA 0.65) by ChiA, ChiB and ChiC from Serratia marcescens. The pictures show chromatograms from size-exclusion chromatography. The peaks are marked by numbers which indicate the lengths (DP) of the oligomers they contain, or, in the case of peaks containing only one known compound, by the sequence of the oligomer. The annotation of the peaks is based on the use of standard samples, as well as NMR analyses. The α-values denote the degree of scission [full conversion of the chitosan to dimers only (DPn = 2) would give an α = 0.5 (α = 1/DPn)]. The lower panels represent the maximum obtainable α-values. Undegraded chitosan and fragments with a DP > 40 elute in the void volume of the column. The figure is from Horn et al. [56], and is reproduced with permission from Wiley-Blackwell. Additional product profiles at very low α for ChiA and ChiB that clearly reveal processivity have been published in Sikorski et al. [118].Figure 3 shows a totally different product pattern for ChiC that is characteristic for an endo-acting, non-processive enzyme. ChiC converts chitosan to a continuum of oligomers of different sizes and the polymer peak disappears early in the degradation reaction. Also, there is initially no accumulation of dimers or other even numbered oligomers. This all indicates that ChiC attacks the polymeric substrate chains in random positions, without processivity. Indeed, this “endo” activity could be confirmed by viscosity measurements during the hydrolysis reaction [118]. The contrast with ChiA and ChiB is perhaps best illustrated by the void peak, which disappears much more slowly in the case of processive enzymes. These latter enzymes perform many cuts per chain instead of a few cuts in every chain as in the case of ChiC.Analysis of the sequences of the products (Table 2) showed considerable differences between the enzymes as well as differences over the time course of the degradation reactions. In all three enzymes, productive binding requires a GlcNAc in subsite -1, explaining why all products have a GlcNAc at their reducing ends. The enzymes did not have any detectable preferences for GlcNAc versus GlcN in the +1 subsite, and this is reflected in the oligomers having both N-acetylated and deacetylated non-reducing ends. All three chitinases showed a strong, but not absolute, preference for GlcNAc in subsite -2, meaning that oligomers preferentially have an N-acetylated unit next to the reducing end. The kinetics of the reaction with ChiB illustrate this (Figure 4; Table 2): in the initial rapid phase of the reaction almost all oligomeric producs have −AA at their reducing ends; during the second, much slower phase, oligomeric products ending at −DA appear to a larger extent [56, 64]. The preference for a GlcNAc in subsite -2 was strongest and in fact almost absolute for ChiC; all oligomeric products end with −AA, at any point during the reaction (Table 2).Time course of the degradation of a chitosan with FA 0.65 by ChiB from Serratia marcescens. The graph shows the degree of scission (α) as a function of time; the biphasic kinetics is clearly visible. The slow phase continues until α reaches a value of about 0.37.

Data from Horn et al. [56]. Reproduced with permission from Wiley-Blackwell.Figure 5 shows how the outcome in terms of the length distribution of products can be manipulated by varying the FA of the chitosan. Obviously, since we are working with chitinases with clear preferences for GlcNAcs at certain positions in the substrate, the products get longer as the FA goes down. It is quite remarkable that a chitinase such as ChiB works well on chitosans with FA close to only 10%.Size-distribution of oligomers after extended hydrolysis of various chitosans with ChiB from Serratia marcescens. The pictures show chromatograms revealing the size-distribution of oligomers obtained upon extended hydrolysis of chitosans with FA of 0.65, 0.50, 0.32 and 0.13 to α-values (corresponding DPn-values in brackets) of 0.37 (2.7), 0.34 (2.9), 0.22 (4.5) and 0.11 (9.5), respectively. Figure from Sørbotten et al. [64]. Reproduced with permission from Wiley-Blackwell.Sikorski et al. [114,118] have produced a model for the degradation of different chitosans with ChiB, which is capable of accurately predicting the outcome of hydrolysis reactions in terms of the length distributions of the products at varying α. This model can be used to predict how reactions need to be set up in order to maximize the production of CHOS of certain lengths (Figure 6).2D profiles showing the predicted outcome of chitosan hydrolysis with ChiB from Serratia marcescens. The X-axis shows the degree of scission, α, and the Y-axis shows the FA of the starting chitosan. The predicted amount of a particular product at specific α - FA combinations is indicated by color (the amounts of oligomers are expressed as % of the total mass of the polymer in the hydrolysis reaction and color coded as defined in the inserts). These profiles allow for selection of optimal reaction and substrate parameters for efficient production of oligomers with desired lengths. For example, high yields of octamer could be obtained if chitosan with FA 0.4 is hydrolyzed to α = 0.18 (the arrow indicates the maximum level of octamers). For example, for the octamer, at maximum yield conditions, approximately 8% of the polymer is expected to be converted to octamers. Figure taken from Sikorski et al. [114], and reproduced with permission from Wiley-Blackwell.ChiG, a bacterial family 19 chitinase from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), produces quite different CHOS as compared to the family 18 chitinases, reflecting the very different binding preferences in the active sites of the enzymes [115]. Since ChiG, which operates according to a non-processive endo-mode of action (Figure 7), uses the inverting mechanism, there is no absolute requirement for GlcNAc in subsite -1. This means that the reducing ends of the oligomeric products could be both N-acetylated and deacetylated, as was indeed observed. The non-reducing ends of the oligomers were found to be exclusively N-acetylated, and the sugar units in the neighboring position to reducing ends were also found to be exclusively N-acetylated. Thus, ChiG has an absolute preference for a GlcNAc in subsites -2 and +1. The enzyme also has considerable preference for GlcNAc in -1 and kinetics were clearly biphasic: In the first fast phase cleavage occurred in A-A↓A sequences, whereas A-D↓A sequences were cleaved in the slower second phase [115]. So, while the chromatograms of Figure 7 may look somewhat similar to the chromatogram for the family 18 enzyme ChiC in Figure 3, the sequences of the produced oligomers show considerable differences, which may affect bioactivity. More generally, it is clear that ChiG will yield oligomers of different PA as compared to those obtained by ChiA, ChiB and ChiC. For example, degrading a chitosan with FA = 0.65 with ChiB and ChiG gives the trimers DAA and AAD, respectively [64,115].Size-distribution of oligomers emerging during hydrolysis of chitosan with FA 0.64 by ChiG from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). See legend to Figure 3 for further explanation. Figure from Heggset et al. [115]. Reproduced with permission from American Chemical Society.Figure 8 shows that varying the FA of the chitosan had a major effect on the size distribution of the products and the extent of cleavage. Interestingly, ChiG efficiency is much more sensitive for deacetylation than the efficiency of ChiB (compare Figure 8 with Figure 5).Size-distribution of oligomers after extended hydrolysis of various chitosans with ChiG from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). The chitosans with FA of 0.13, 0.32, 0.50, and 0.64 were degraded to maximum α-values of 0.04, 0.12, 0.23, and 0.33, respectively. Peaks are labeled as in Figure 3. Figure from Heggset et al. [115]. Reproduced with permission from American Chemical Society.Other studies on the degradation of chitosan with family 19 chitinases confirm the findings for ChiG. In one study, the family 19 chitinase ChiC from Streptomyces griseus HUT 6037 was used to (extensively) degrade a chitosan with a degree of N-acetylation of 47% and the products were isolated and characterized [116]. The identities of the isolated CHOS were AD, AAD, ADAD, ADDAA and AADDAA, and it was concluded that this enzyme has an absolute specificity for N-acetylated units in the -2 and +1 subsites, in agreement with the results for ChiG from Streptomyces coelicolor. A family 19 chitinase from rice [117] has been found to operate according to a non-processive endo-mode of action, with strong preferences for N-acetylated units in subsites -2 and +1, and with less strong preference for N-acetylated units in the -1 subsite.The GH 46 family of chitosanases comprises enzymes classified as subclass I (cleaving A-D and D-D linkages) [60] as well as subclass III (cleaving D-A and D-D linkages) [120]. In an early study, a chitosan with FA = 0.25–0.35 was extensively degraded with CsnN174 from Streptomyces sp. N174 and the oligomeric products were isolated and characterized. In addition to the fully deacetylated oligomers D, DD and DDD, several hetero-oligomers were identified (the dimer DA, the trimers DDA and DAA, the tetramers DDAA and DAAA and the pentamer DDAAA) [60]. These results suggest that CsnN174 has a high specificity for a GlcN in the +1 subsite (new non-reducing ends), whereas both GlcNAc and GlcN seem to be acceptable in the -1 subsite (new reducing ends). Further insight into the properties of CsnN174 would require studies of oligomer production over time, as well as studies using chitosans of varying FA.Recent work in our own laboratories on a family 46 chitosanase, Csn88, from Streptomyces coelicolor has shown that this enzyme is capable of degrading chitosans with varying FA, producing oligomers with both N-acetylated and deacetylated reducing ends [121]. 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis showed that when the new reducing ends were N-acetylated, the sugar binding in the neighbouring position (i.e., binding in subsite -2) always was deacetylated. However, in oligomers with deacetylated sugars at the new reducing end, both N-acetylated and deacetylated sugar occurred in the neighbouring position (revealed by mass spectrometry). The identity of the new non-reducing ends was studied using 13C NMR spectroscopy and this analysis showed that initial products exclusively had deacetylated non-reducing ends, whereas N-acetylated non-reducing ends appeared later during the reaction. All in all, these preliminary data indicate that Csn88 can cleave D-A, A-D and D-D linkages. As expected maximum α values were high, for example 0.59 for a highly deacetylated chitosan (FA 0.008) and 0.44 for a FA 0.32 chitosan.Several authors have employed unspecific enzymes such as papaine and cellulases to degrade chitosans (e.g., [122–124]). Since the enzyme preparations used tend to be rather crude and derived from sources (fungi, plants) that are known to produce chitinolytic enzymes, there remains some doubt concerning which enzymes actually catalyze the hydrolysis reactions. However, for the practical purpose of producing CHOS, the use of (cheap) unspecific enzymes may be quite useful.Of chemical methods for hydrolysis of chitosan [32–35], acid hydrolysis is probably the best known. Early studies on acid hydrolysis of chitosans had shown that it is possible to convert fully deacetylated chitosan to CHOS in concentrated hydrochloric acid [32]. In later studies [33], using a variety of chitosans, the acid-catalyzed degradation rates of chitosans were shown to depend on FA, and the initial degradation rate constant was found to increase in direct proportion to FA. Acid hydrolysis was found to be highly specific to cleavage of A-A and A-D glycosidic linkages, which were hydrolyzed with two to three orders of magnitude higher rates than the D-D and D-A linkages. This preference is probably due to a combination of two factors: (1) the presence of a positively charged amino group (as in GlcN) close to the glycosidic linkage is inhibitory, and (2) the presence of an acetamidogroup (as in GlcNAc) close to the glycosidic linkage may yield some degree of substrateassistance to the hydrolytic mechanism. In the same study it was shown that the rate of deacetylation was less than one-tenth of the rate of depolymerization in concentrated acid, whereas the two rates were found to be equal in dilute acid. It was suggested that this is due to these two processes having different reaction mechanisms with different rate-limiting steps [33].Chemical synthesis of CHOS requires multiple protection and deprotection steps, and is today not a routine procedure. Chemical synthesis of CHOS gives rise to pure compounds, but most methods existing today are time consuming and require extensive use of organic solvents and/or are not capable of producing anything else than homo-oligomers. There are in fact only a few examples of chemically synthesized CHOS in the literature. Kuyama et al. [125] performed synthesis of fully deacetylated chitosan dodecamers starting with glucosamine monomers using phthalimido as the amino protective group. Aly et al. [126] reported a method for synthesis of fully N-acetylated CHOS from GlcN monomers using dimethylmaleoyl as an amino protective group for synthesis of chitotetraose and chitohexaose. Removal of the amino protective group and N-acetylation was performed in a one-pot reaction to give the desired products [127]. In principle it would be possible to combine the use of these two described protection methods to synthesize partly deacetylated CHOS, but this has so far not been reported (to our knowledge).Trombotto et al. [128] have reported a method for chemical preparation of partly deacetylated CHOS from fully deacetylated high molecular weight chitosan. The starting chitosan was partially depolymerized using HCl to produce fully deacetylated oligomers that were fractionated by selective precipitation and ultrafiltration to yield a mixture of DP 2–DP 12. The oligomers were then partly N-acetylated using stochiometric amounts of acetic anhydride to reach the decided FA. In this way, CHOS fractions of DP between 2 and 12 were successfully prepared. The drawback of this method, as for the enzymatic preparation of CHOS, is the heterogeneity of the prepared CHOS.In an early study, Letzel et al. [103] used a similar approach: chitosan with FA 0.02 was hydrolyzed with HCl, oligomers were separated by DP using gel permeation chromatography and the resulting CHOS fractions were N-acetylated using substoichiometric amounts of acetic anhydride to control the FA. Interestingly, some of the fractions produced in this study inhibited the family 18 chitinase ChiB from Serratia marcescens.In principle, chemoenzymatic synthesis provides opportunities to produce pure CHOS of defined DP, FA and PA without the use of extensive protection of the functional groups at the sugar unit. So far this has been done by allowing an oxazoline, imitating the intermediate of chitin hydrolysis, to act as a glycosyl donor in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction where another GlcN/GlcNAc unit acts as a glycosyl acceptor [129]. By using oxazoline oligomeric building blocks of specific DP, FA, and PA, longer specific CHOS can be made using this approach. The main disadvantage using the chemo-enzymatic approach is that the product is necessarily also a substrate for the enzyme, which can result in poor yields. To avoid this problem, modified enzymes with reduced hydrolytic activity may be employed. The enzyme modifications would need to be aimed at reducing hydrolytic power, while increasing binding strength for the glycosyl donor in the glycon subsites [130].CHOS produced enzymatically or chemically normally consist of a mixture of oligomers differing in DP, FA and PA. Several techniques for separation and purification of CHOS have been reported, like gelfiltration [64], ultrafiltration [131], and ion exchange [132] and metal affinity [133] chromatography. Often, such techniques need to be applied in combination to obtain homogeneous CHOS fractions. Despite some successful studies, the production of pure CHOS fractions is generally a time consuming and challenging task.Preparative separation of CHOS is most commonly based on size, through size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Recently, good methods for the separation of oligomers up to DP 40 (individual oligomers up to DP 20) have been described [64], as illustrated by Figure 3, ​,5,5, ​,77 and ​and8.8. The SEC system used for producing the data displayed in this review is based on SuperdexTM 30 (GE Healthcare) columns that are coupled in series. The oligomers are detected using an online refractive index detector. This system allows separation of CHOS with similar DP values ranging from approximately DP 2 to DP 20, independently of FA and PA [64].Further separation of CHOS can be achieved using cation-exchange chromatography, because protonated amino groups on the deacetylated sugars interact with the ion-exchange material. With this method CHOS of identical DP will be separated based on the number of deacetylated units [132]. A further partial separation of isobaric CHOS (identical FA, different PA) may be achieved using strong cation exchange chromatography. Although, the latter separations are promising and useful, baseline separation of isobaric CHOS has so far not been achieved [132]. In an alternative strategy, metal affinity chromatography has been successfully used for separation of shorter CHOS. CHOS have a strong affinity for Cu2+, and using copper as a chelating agent gives separation up to 90% of fully deacetylated CHOS of DP 3 and higher [133]. This has not been reported for N-acetylated mixtures of CHOS.In order to characterize CHOS in terms of DP, FA and PA, several techniques have been applied, primarily nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry. Using NMR, it is possible to determine FA in a chitosan or CHOS sample and to (partially) identify the PA in shorter CHOS depending on the complexity of the oligomer mixture. Resonances detected using NMR reveal that the H-1 resonance of a reducing unit is sensitive to its nearest neighbor, making it possible to (partially) determine the PA of an oligomer [64]. In addition, the PA of dimers and trimers can be determined using NMR. The identity of the non-reducing end unit of an oligomer can be determined using 13C NMR, which in some instances also may reveal the identity of its nearest neighbor [108].Modern mass spectrometry provides excellent tools for the identification of the DP and FA of CHOS [104,134]. In 1997 Okafo et al. [135] reported a reductive amination of CHOS using 2-aminoacridone (AMAC), which is useful for tagging of the reducing end. Building on this labeling technique, Bahrke et al. [134] developed a method for sequencing of CHOS up to DP 12 using reducing end derivatization with AMAC. Starting with CHOS fractions of homogeneous DP they used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) postsource decay (PSD) mass spectrometry (MS) for sequence determination. Reducing end derivatization of CHOS using AMAC favors formation of Y-type ions, meaning that sugars are only cleaved after the oxygen in the β(1→4) linkage from the reducing end. Consequently, interpretation of the resulting mass spectra is quite straightforward. It should be noted though that the method has limitations when applied to mixtures.In a later study from the same group [132], a second method for reductive amination, using 3-(acetylamino)-6-aminoacridine, was adopted. Combined detection and fragmentation of isobaric CHOS using MALDI iontrap MSn was reported. The described technique makes it possible to simultaneously determine sequence and quantity of CHOS of identical DP but different FA and PA in an isobaric CHOS mixture.Literature contains numerous papers reporting a remarkably wide range of biological activities of CHOS. As discussed above, the molecular mechanisms behind these bioactivities are mostly unknown and so is the exact nature of the bioactive component. Many activities have been reported only once or twice, providing insufficient basis to make general conclusions about the applicability of CHOS. Below, we discuss a selection of studies that report such bioactivities, with focus on studies that contain some discussion of the molecular mechanisms involved.It has been known since the 1970s that CHOS have anti-tumor effects [18], and there is also evidence for positive effects of CHOS in reducing metastasis from tumors [19,20]. It was first suggested that the anti-tumor activity was due to the cationic properties of CHOS [18]. Later, MW also was proposed to play a major role [136]. Maeda and Kimura [137] found that CHOS enhanced the natural killer activity in intestinal intraepitelial lymphocytes at the same time as they reduced tumor growth in mice, and suggested that this CHOS-activation of intestinal immune functions could be useful in treating tumors.There are indications that apoptosis is involved in the tumor-reducing effects of CHOS. Harish Prashanth and Tharanathan [138] discovered that DNA from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was fragmented after incubation with CHOS, an indication of apoptosis. CHOS have also been shown to induce apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell via upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax [139].In recent years, the hypothesis that the anti-tumor effects of CHOS are related to their inhibitory effects on angiogenesis has received some attention [138,140,141]. Angiogenesis is the formation of new capillary blood vessels from already existing blood vessels. This process is important for tumor formation, since tumor growth and metastasis require angiogenesis when the tumor reaches a certain size. Xiong et al. [142] compared effects of dimers to hexamers of fully deacetylated CHOS on angiogenesis and found that the hexamers were the most effective inhibitors, whereas Wang et al. [140] showed that N-acetylated CHOS were more effective in preventing angiogenesis than fully deacetylated CHOS, both in vitro and in vivo.AMCase is induced during TH2 inflammation through an interleukin (IL)-13 dependent mechanism and has been demonstrated to be heavily over-expressed in human asthmatic tissue [10,12]. Inhibition of the AMCase with the well known chitinase inhibitor allosamidin reduced the inflammation [12]. The fact that chitinases are a factor in host antiparasite responses and in asthmatic TH2 inflammation led to the hypothesis that asthma may be a parasite-independent antiparasite response [10], which again suggests that inhibition of AMCase is a potential target for asthma therapy [9–12]. It has been shown that partially deacetylated CHOS can function as inhibitors of family 18 chitinases [103–105]. There is therefore a great potential for CHOS as an anti-inflammatory drug in patients with asthma. For a more detailed description of this and related topics, see the review by Muzzarelli in this special issue of Marine Drugs [143].Mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow are able to differentiate into chondrocytes (cartilage), adipocytes (fat) and osteoblasts (bone). Osteoblasts produce osteoid; which is further mineralized to produce the bone matrix. Bone-tissue is mainly composed of bone matrix and osteoblasts. Chitosan and CHOS are known to increase the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts and to consequently facilitate the formation of bone-tissue [21,22].The mineralization process and bone strength are dependent on Ca2+, which helps to support the structure. There is evidence that CHOS increase calcium-deposition in bone [22,144,145]. Jung et al. [144] found that CHOS could efficiently inhibit the formation of insoluble calcium-phosphate salts and consequently increase Ca2+ bioavailability and bone strength. They also found that CHOS (<5 kDa) gave increased calcium retention and decreased bone turnover in a rat osteoporosis model. This indicates that CHOS may have beneficial effects as a calcium fortifier in conditions of Ca2+ deficiency, such as in osteoporosis.Chitosans have been successfully used as vectors for delivery of genes (gene therapy) since the first report about 15 years ago [146,147]. Chitosan forms stable complexes with plasmid DNA and can be used as a vector for the administration of genes to mucosal tissues such as the lungs [148] and intestinal epithelium [149,150]. There are, however, certain drawbacks connected to the use of high molecular weight chitosans because of the low solubility at physiological pH, the high viscosity and the fact that the chitosan complexes often tend to form aggregates. By using CHOS instead of chitosan these drawbacks may be overcome [16]. Köping-Höggård et al. [16] showed that fully deacetylated CHOS (DP 24) formed stable complexes with plasmid DNA, and in vitro and in vivo experiments proved that these CHOS were effective vectors for delivery of genes [16,17]. It has been speculated that a delicate balance between the stability of the CHOS-DNA-complexes at lower pH-values (around pH 6) and their instability at higher pH-values (above pH 7) could be the reason for their efficiency [151]. This has recently been confirmed in detailed studies of how chitosan chemistry can be used to create an optimal balance between the stability of the complexes and their unpacking [152].Some pathogens can initiate disease in humans by using carbohydrate binding proteins (lectins) to attach to complementary membrane-bound oligosaccharides on host cells [153,154]. Observed antibacterial and anti-infective effects of CHOS [13] are thought to be due to their ability to bind to the lectins on human pathogens and, consequently, prevent adhesion to human cells. A priori, one would expect the sequence of GlcNAc and GlcN units in CHOS to be important for binding affinity, and for ensuring selectivity for pathogens (i.e., the CHOS should preferably not bind to lectins of the normal bacterial flora). In a recent study, it was shown that a mixture of 97% deacetylated tetramers significantly inhibited adhesion of certain enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains to human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial (HT29) cells in tissue culture, whereas the binding of other E. coli strains was not inhibited [13]. Since pathogens vary in terms of their lectins, identification of both the target-lectins and the possible complementary CHOS are important when pursuing this application route of CHOS.Malaria is caused by several species of the parasite Plasmodium. P. falciparum causes the most serious forms of malaria in humans, whereas P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malarie give a milder disease that is not generally fatal [155]. Each year, 350–500 million cases of malaria occur worldwide, and over one million people die, most of them young children in sub-Saharan Africa. There is no vaccine available, and the identification of molecular targets for vaccine development is of great importance. Anopheles mosquitoes transmit the malaria-parasite from one infected person to another and the most important control strategy for malaria today is to interfere with different stages in the life cycle of the Plasmodium parasite.During its life cycle, the Plasmodium parasite must be capable of penetrating the chitin-containing periotrophic matrix surrounding the mosquito midgut, to make the mosquito infective. To do so, Plasmodium species secrete family 18 chitinases capable of degrading the periotrophic matrix [23,156–160]. The P. falciparum chitinase (PfCHT1), the P. vivax chitinase (PvCHT1) and the P. gallinaceum chitinase (PgCHT1) have been characterized [161–163]. P. gallinaceum is the only malaria parasite species where more than one chitinase gene has been identified, and PgCHT1 and PgCHT2 are both family 18 chitinases. One approach to vector control might be inhibition of the secreted Plasmodium chitinases by chitinase inhibitors that are taken up by the mosquito via the blood meal [23,156–160]. Several studies have convincingly shown that inhibition of Plasmodium chitinases indeed reduces infectivity [23,163,164]. CHOS may perhaps be developed as nontoxic, inexpensive small-molecule inhibitors of these chitinases.The use of chitosan in wound dressings has been explored to a certain extent and positive effects have been documented in several studies [14,165–169]. Similar positive effects have been documented for CHOS, which were shown to accelerate the wound healing process [14,15]. It is quite likely that chitosan is converted to CHOS by naturally occurring enzymes and that the activity observed for chitosan might in fact be caused by CHOS. It may thus be advantageous to use CHOS in wound dressings to get a more immediate effect.CHOS are thought to accelerate wound healing by enhancing the functions of inflammatory and repairing cells [170–172]. For example, it has been shown that subcutaneous injection of hexamers of CHOS enhanced migration of polymorphonuclear cells in dogs [171]. Hexamers of N-acetylated and fully deacetylated CHOS were shown to induce persistent release of IL-8, a potent activator and chemoattractant of polymorphonuclear cells, from fibroblasts from rats in vitro [170]. It must be noted that most authors ascribe the beneficial effect of longer CHOS and (polymeric) chitosan on wound healing to the ability of these compounds to form biocompatible ordered tissue-like structures (see [167] and references therein).Hemostatic effects may also contribute to the beneficial effects of chitosan/CHOS in wound dressings. Chitosan enhances platelet adhesion and aggregation [165,173] and increases the release of the platelet derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) and the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) from platelets in canine blood [173]. These two factors retract inflammatory cells which are thought to be important in wound healing. Chitosan also has the ability of causing erythrocytes to aggregate [169].Minagawa et al. [166] compared wound break strength and the increase in collagenase activity in wounds in rats after exposure to monomers, oligomers and polymers of the chitin-group (GlcNAc/N-acetylated CHOS/chitin) and the chitosan-group (GlcN/fully deacetylated CHOS/chitosan). They found that all six compounds increased both the wound break strength and the collagenase activity. Overall, the non-acetylated compounds were most effective compared to the corresponding N-acetylated compounds. The oligomers of fully deacetylated CHOS were most effective for wound break strength and GlcN gave the highest activity of collagenase. The enzyme collagenase is produced mainly by fibroblasts and inflammatory cells and its activity is related to remodeling in wound healing [174].The antifungal activity of chitosan was discovered already in 1979 [175], and has been utilized to inhibit fungal growth in crops [176]. The antifungal potential of CHOS has to a lesser extent been investigated. In 1984 Kendra and Hadwiger [177] tested the antifungal activity of monomers– heptamers of deacetylated CHOS on Fusarium solani, which is infectious to pea crops, and found that the heptamer was most effective.Subsequent research has revealed that longer oligomers of CHOS (also called low molecular weight chitosan, LMWC) are more effective. LMWC (4.6 kDa, average DP of 23) shows antifungal activity against Candida krusei and inhibits spore germination in Fusarium oxysporum [178]. Seyfarth et al. [26] found antifungal effects of LMWC on different Candida species. Both DP and FA of the chitosan/CHOS are of great importance for the antifungal potential and LMWC with low FA so far seems to be the most promising type of compound [179].The anti-fungal effect of LMWC seems to be caused by its interaction with lipids in the plasma membrane, leading to morphological changes and cell surface disruptions [180,181]. The composition of the fungal plasma-membrane seems to be important for the sensitivity against chitosan, and a higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids makes the fungi more sensitive [182].From literature studies, as well as from own unpublished work on non-medical use of LMWC as anti-fungals, it is clear that LMWC indeed have a considerable potential in this area. This is a good reason for giving the application of LMWC, to combat fungal infections in humans, more research attention than it has received so far.Despite major progress in the past decade, the production of pure CHOS with defined DP, FA and PA is still a challenge. However, it is now fully possible to carry out controlled and reasonably well understood enzymatic production processes that yield CHOS preparations that are enriched for certain known compounds. The outcome of such processes can be controlled by controlling the enzyme, the starting chitosan (primarily FA), and the extent to which the degradation reaction is allowed to develop. Further refinement of the production step may be achieved by using engineered enzymes with changed binding preferences in one or more of their subsites and by carrying out specific deacetylation steps with chitin deacetylases.Techniques for further purification of CHOS as well as for sequence determination are now available, but are still quite challenging to exploit. Scaling up purification methods at an economically acceptable cost is another challenge, meaning that, from an economical point of view, it is probably cheaper to produce CHOS mixtures that are enriched for a bioactivity, rather than producing truly pure compounds. It is conceivable that the further development of CHOS as bioactive molecules may include further functionalization by chemical methods, for example by coupling groups to the reducing end.These improved methods for producing (almost) pure, well-characterized CHOS will help to create a knowledge base for understanding how CHOS exert bioactivities. For example, it may soon be possible to determine the crystal structures of chitinases in complex with a CHOS acting as an inhibitor. Likewise, the interaction of CHOS with AMCase [183] or HCgp39 [184] may be assessed by structural studies.CHOS have a remarkably wide spectrum of possible bioactivities. While highly promising, there is no doubt that these bioactivities need to be substantiated by further studies with well-defined CHOS preparations, as well as by fundamental research on the molecular mechanism behind the activity. Only then the great promise of converting an abundant bioresource, chitin, to CHOS-based medicines can be met."
PMC2885245,A Membrane-located Glycosyltransferase Complex Required for Biosynthesis of the d-Galactan I Lipopolysaccharide O Antigen in Klebsiella pneumoniae,False,"d-Galactan I is a polysaccharide with the disaccharide repeat unit structure [→3-β-d-Galf-(1→3)-α-d-Galp-(1→]. This glycan represents the lipopolysaccharide O antigen found in many Gram-negative bacteria, including several Klebsiella pneumoniae O serotypes. The polysaccharide is synthesized in the cytoplasm prior to its export via an ATP-binding cassette transporter. Sequence analysis predicts three galactosyltransferases in the d-galactan I genetic locus. They are WbbO (belonging to glycosyltransferase (GT) family 4), WbbM (GT-family 8), and WbbN (GT-family 2). The WbbO and WbbM proteins are each predicted to contain two domains, with the GT modules located toward their C termini. The N-terminal domains of WbbO and WbbM exhibit no similarity to proteins with known function. In vivo complementation assays suggest that all three glycosyltransferases are required for d-galactan I biosynthesis. Using a bacterial two-hybrid system and confirmatory co-purification strategies, evidence is provided for protein-protein interactions among the glycosyltransferases, creating a membrane-located enzyme complex dedicated to d-galactan I biosynthesis.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)3 is a major component of the outer leaflet of the Gram-negative outer membrane. In many bacteria, including members of the Enterobacteriaceae, LPS is made up of three structural domains; lipid A, the core oligosaccharide (OS), and the O antigenic polysaccharide (O-PS). Lipid-A-core OS and O-PS are synthesized by independent pathways at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane and are subsequently linked together in the periplasm by the O-PS ligase (reviewed in Ref. 1). Although the structure of lipid-A is highly conserved among Gram-negative bacteria, and the core OSs share structural themes, the O-PS structures are remarkably diverse (1).The O-PS polymer known as d-galactan I contains the disaccharide repeat unit structure: [→3-β-d-Galf-(1→3)-α-d-Galp-(1→] (Fig. 1) and is found in the LPS of several Gram-negative bacteria, including some Klebsiella pneumoniae O serotypes. It is the sole O-PS in K. pneumoniae O2a (2). In other serotypes, d-galactan I can be modified by O-acetylation (3, 4) or capped by an additional polymeric domain with a different repeat unit structure (5,–7). Each of these modifications confers a unique O-serospecificity. Similar structures are found in other bacterial genera, including Serratia (8, 9), and the genetic loci for d-galactan I biosynthesis are conserved in organization and content (4).Biosynthesis of d-galactan I from K. pneumoniae O2a. A, structure of the d-galactan I polysaccharide (11). The adaptor region consists of two galactose residues believed to be added to und-PP-GlcNAc by WbbO (14, 20). The precise glycosyltransferase activities required for extension of the d-galactan I domain remain undetermined. B, the d-galactan I biosynthesis cluster. The various roles of the proteins encoded by these genes are given. Known and predicted galactosyltransferases are highlighted (gray fill). The UDP-Galp precursor is generated by UDP-Gal-4-epimerase, a housekeeping enzyme (48). In contrast, UDP-Galf is required only for the d-galactan I biosynthesis in K. pneumoniae, so the dedicated UDP-Galp mutase enzyme (Glf) is encoded by a gene in the biosynthesis gene cluster (21).There are two fundamentally different pathways by which most O-PSs are assembled: the Wzy-dependent pathway and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent pathway (1). d-Galactan I provides an example of ABC transporter-dependent biosynthesis. In the Enterobacteriaceae (and many other bacteria), the ABC transporter-dependent pathways begins with the synthesis of the polymer repeat units on an acceptor consisting of undecaprenol diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (und-PP-GlcNAc). The acceptor is synthesized by the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:Und-P GlcNAc-1-P transferase, WecA (10,–13). This requirement has been established for d-galactan-I (14). O-PS is elongated on this acceptor at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane by dedicated O-antigen-specific glycosyltransferases. The polymer is elongated by sequential glycosyltransfer to the non-reducing terminus. Chain extension in the ABC transporter-dependent pathways is then terminated by one of two remarkably different strategies. In a model exemplified by the polymannose O-PSs from Escherichia coli O8 and O9a, a residue not found in the repeat unit structure is added to the non-reducing terminus and this serves as an export signal (15,–17). The completed O-PS structure is then exported across the membrane by the ABC transporter, which is composed of two Wzm (transmembrane domain) polypeptides, and two Wzt (nucleotide-binding domain) polypeptides. In E. coli O8/O9a, Wzt contains an additional carbohydrate-binding module that recognizes the precise export signal on the nascent polymer (16, 17). In contrast, in the biosynthesis of d-galactan I in K. pneumoniae O2a, chain termination is determined by an interaction between the transporter and the glycosyltransferases (or their product) in a manner that is not yet determined (18). There is no identifiable export signal on the polymer and, unlike the O8/O9a situation, the d-galactan I Wzt protein has no specificity for a particular polysaccharide structure. Regardless of the assembly pathway, the completed O-PS is then ligated to lipid-A core at the periplasmic face of the membrane by the O-PS ligase. The mature LPS molecules are then shuttled to the outer membrane by the Lpt pathway (19).Biosynthesis and export of the O-PS are predicted to require strict coordination of initiation, elongation, and export to maintain the specific O-PS chain length. Current models for O-PS biosynthesis invoke a coordinated multienzyme complex but experimental evidence for such complexes is generally limited. The goal of this study was to examine potential protein-protein interactions among enzymes required for d-galactan I biosynthesis. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that the K. pneumoniae d-galactan I biosynthesis gene cluster encodes three predicted galactosyltransferases, designated WbbM, WbbN, and WbbO, with confirmatory experimental evidence being available for WbbO and WbbM (20). The cluster also encodes the UDP-galactopyranose mutase (Glf) enzyme responsible for production of the UDP-Galf precursor (21) (see Fig. 1). Using a bacterial two-hybrid system and co-purification, interactions between the glycosyltransferases involved in d-galactan I biosynthesis have been confirmed, suggesting that they do indeed form a multienzyme complex.The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table 1. Bacteria were grown at 37 or 30 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (22). Glucose (0.05–0.4% w/v), galactose (0.1% w/v), arabinose (0.002–0.2% w/v), or isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5–1.0 mm) were added as required. The antibiotics ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and trimethoprim (100 μg/ml) were added where appropriate. For bacterial two-hybrid analyses, bromochloroindolyl galactopyranoside (X-gal; 40 μg/ml) was added to the medium.Bacterial strains and plasmidsDNAzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to purify chromosomal DNA. DNA fragments were PCR-amplified using Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science) with custom oligonucleotide primers (Sigma). Where appropriate, the primers included restriction sites to facilitate cloning (supplemental Table S1). Mutagenesis was carried out using complementary oligonucleotides designed to incorporate the desired base changes (supplemental Table S1). The procedure was based upon the QuikChange method (Stratagene). Mutagenesis of the desired base pairs was confirmed by sequencing (Guelph Molecular Super Center). DNA fragments from PCR or restriction enzyme digests were purified from agarose gels using the GeneElute gel extraction kit (Sigma). Plasmid DNA was purified using the GeneElute plasmid purification kit (Sigma). Restriction enzyme digests and DNA ligation reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.Cultures were grown in 250 ml of LB medium at 37 °C. Genes encoding proteins of interest were cloned behind arabinose-inducible promoters in pBAD vectors (23). Protein expression was induced at mid-exponential growth phase (A600 = 0.6) by the addition of 0.02% arabinose and the cultures were grown for an additional 2 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), prior to lysis by passage through a French pressure cell. A cleared cell-free lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min. This was followed by a second centrifugation step at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Centrifugation of the lysate at 100,000 × g for 60 min separated the membrane fraction (P100) from the soluble fraction (S100).Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 12% resolving gels and visualized by Simply Blue stain (Invitrogen). Samples containing FLAG-, polyhistidine-, or glutathionine S-transferase (GST)-tagged proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (PerkinElmer Life Science). Immunoblots were probed with a 1:2,000 dilution of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), anti-His5 antibody (Qiagen), or anti-GST antibody (Novagen). Nitrocellulose membranes were then washed three times for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline. This was followed by incubation for 1 h in a 1:3,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Detection was carried out according to instructions supplied with the Western Lightning reagent (PerkinElmer).His10-WbbM protein was purified from E. coli Top10 containing plasmid pWQ522 and protein expression was induced as described above using 0.2% arabinose. The cell pellet was then stored at −20 °C until required. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing the dissolved protease inhibitor tablets (Roche) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation steps at 4,000 × g for 10 min and 12,000 × g for 15 min. The soluble fraction was then collected by further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and His10-WbbM was purified using His-Select Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma). After sequential washes with buffer B and buffer B containing 10 mm imidazole and 25 mm imidazole, the protein was eluted from the column in buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluate containing His10-WbbM protein was exchanged into buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) and concentrated using a Microcon YM-10 column (Millipore). Purified protein was mixed with Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant (Sigma) in a 1:1 ratio prior to inoculation into New Zealand White rabbits at the Central Animal Facility at the University of Guelph. The antibody preparation was partially purified over a DEAE Affi-Gel Blue column (Bio-Rad) and nonspecific antibody was then removed by adsorption against whole nitrocellulose membrane-immobilized cell lysate of E. coli Top10. For Western blot analysis, anti-WbbM was used at a 1:2,000 dilution and detected with a 1:3,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).Combinations of the putative galactosyltransferases bearing various epitope and purification tags were coexpressed in E. coli Top10. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.2% arabinose or 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described above. Cell pellets were collected and stored at −20 °C overnight. Pellets were resuspended in 25 ml of buffer D (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 750 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.5) and lysed by sonication. Triton X-100 (0.1% final concentration) was added to the lysate to release the typically membrane-associated glycosyltransferases into the soluble fraction. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected and mixed with the appropriate affinity resin. Mixing was performed for either 1 h at 4 °C for TALON metal affinity His-select resin (BD Biosciences), or overnight at 4 °C for GST affinity resin (Novagen). After binding, the resin was collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 800 × g and 10 volumes of buffer D containing 0.1% Triton X-100 was added and mixed at room temperature for 10 min. This wash step was repeated before the resin was loaded into a column. The relevant protein was then eluted using buffer D containing either 300 mm imidazole or 10 mm reduced glutathione. Eluates were collected by removing the resin in a final centrifugation step at 800 × g. Samples were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting.The d-galactan I-biosynthesis enzymes were fused to the catalytic domains of adenylate cyclase from Bordetella pertussis via cloning into the BTH vectors: pKT25, pUT18C, and pUT18 (24). Bait and prey plasmids were co-transformed into chemically competent BTH101 E. coli cells (24) and plated on LB plates containing the appropriate antibiotic, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and X-gal. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h, at which time the colonies expressing the leucine zipper (positive control) became dark blue in color, due to the degradation of the chromogenic substrate X-gal. Initial scoring of potential interactions was achieved based on the plate assay. For a quantitative measurement, broth cultures were grown at 30 °C to mid-exponential phase (A660 ∼ 0.5–0.8) and the β-galactosidase activity of each sample was measured using a commercial assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce).Cultures of E. coli CWG286 containing the appropriate plasmids were grown overnight in antibiotic-supplemented LB broth. Protein expression was induced by the addition of arabinose. The galE::Tn10 insertion in CWG286 makes d-galactan I production conditional on addition of galactose to the growth medium (18). After arabinose (varying concentrations) and galactose (0.1%) were added to the medium, cultures were inoculated and then grown for ∼2.5 h. Immunofluorescence microscopy of intact cells was performed as described previously, using d-galactan I-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies (18). Detection was performed using rhodamine red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.). Visualization was carried out using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope using a ×100 objective lens, and the images were processed using Openlab software (Improvision).LPS samples were prepared using the whole cell lysate method of Hitchcock and Brown (25). Samples were separated using 15% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining, or by immunoblot analysis after transfer to nitrocellulose membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoblots were probed with absorbed polyclonal rabbit anti-d-galactan I antibody, as previously described (18). The secondary antibody was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).Secondary structure predictions of protein sequences were performed using the programs Prof, PredictProtein, PSIpred, and Jpred (26,–29). A domain linker program using a supported vector machine (SVM) was used to determine ideal locations to make domain constructs of the protein.The first dedicated step in d-galactan I biosynthesis is catalyzed by WbbO. From both in vivo and in vitro experiments, WbbO is proposed to add the first two sugars (Galp-Galf) to the und-PP-GlcNAc acceptor (14, 20), forming the adaptor region of the O-PS (Fig. 1). Based on its sequence, WbbO belongs to the CAZy glycosyltransferase family 4 (GT-4) (30). The predicted WbbO polypeptide contains 377 residues (42.6 kDa) and SDS-PAGE of His10-WbbO reveals a polypeptide of the expected size (Fig. 2). In E. coli cells, the majority of the overexpressed WbbO protein is located in the membrane (P100) fraction (Fig. 2). WbbO is not predicted to have any membrane-spanning regions (according to DAS, HHMTOP 2.0; TMpred, TopPred II). The protein sequence predicts one short hydrophobic segment (residues 108–120). Although this is not sufficient to span the membrane, this region could potentially intercalate into the membrane (31). WbbO does contain a number of additional helices (particularly the segment between residues 326 and 342), which contain hydrophobic residues and could also participate in its interaction with the membrane; there is precedent for this in other glycosyltransferases (32, 33).Secondary structure prediction and localization of His10-WbbO. A, sequence and predicted secondary structure of WbbO outlining the β-sheets (black arrows) and α-helices (black boxes). The GT-4 domain (residues 131–377) is identified, as is a putative linker region that may separate two independent domains (WbbON and WbbOC). B, cellular localization of the His10-WbbO protein (pWQ528) and its two domains, His10-WbbON (pWQ528) and His10-WbbOC (pWQ529), expressed in E. coli CWG286. Cell-free lysates (S12) were separated into soluble (S100) and membrane-containing (P100) fractions and the His10-tagged proteins were detected using mouse anti-His5 monoclonal antibody. His10-WbbOC could not be detected using anti-His5 antibodies, so the SDS-PAGE Simply Blue-stained gel showing the complete localization is illustrated. The arrow indicates a band present in the whole cell lysate and subsequent fractions, which is found only in cells containing pWQ529; the band corresponds to the predicted size of His10-WbbOC (29.0 kDa). Sample loading was standardized to the original cell suspension (prior to lysis), allowing direct visual assessment of the cellular distribution of His10-WbbO.The predicted WbbO protein sequence was analyzed using a domain linker prediction program using a SVM. The results identified a putative linker, suggesting that WbbO may contain two potential independently folded domains, with the galactosyltransferase activity predicted to be contained within the C-terminal domain (residues 170–365; WbbOC) (Fig. 2). The two putative domains were cloned separately into pBAD vectors. Although the majority of His10-WbbO was confined to the membrane fraction, consistent with its predicted structural features, the separated polypeptide domains were found in both the soluble and membrane fractions with the majority in the soluble fraction. These results suggest that membrane association of full-length WbbO is directed by regions throughout the protein and not solely by the predicted N-terminal hydrophobic region (residues 108–120).Mutant complementation experiments established that full-length His10-WbbO could restore d-galactan I biosynthesis in E. coli CWG286 cells harboring the ΔwbbO construct. This was evident in SDS-PAGE, which revealed long-chain “smooth” LPS (S-LPS) molecules missing in the mutant (Fig. 3). The addition of higher levels of arabinose inducer yielded a S-LPS profile with similar size distribution and staining intensity to the parent. When expressed alone, the galactosyltransferase-containing WbbOC domain (plasmid pWQ529) was sufficient to complement the biosynthesis defect in the ΔwbbO mutant, at least in an overexpression situation. Based on the silver-stained gel, the efficiency of complementation was less than that observed with the full-length WbbO protein, particularly with lower amounts of arabinose, but the size distribution was comparable at higher levels of arabinose. Given the nature of the system, it is difficult to monitor expression of properly folded and localized enzyme, so the significance (if any) of the reduced efficiency is impossible to interpret. In all cases, the identity of the S-LPS was verified by immunoblotting with anti-d-galactan I antibodies (data not shown). Immunofluorescence was used to verify that the S-LPS was present on the cell surface (Fig. 3B). The predicted N-terminal domain (WbbON) could not complement the ΔwbbO mutation as expected (data not shown). Therefore, when expressed from a plasmid, WbbO does not require the N terminus for galactosyltransferase function and the reported α-galactopyranosyl- and β-galactofuranosyltransferase activity (14, 20) of the enzyme is confined to the C-terminal domain of WbbO.Complementation of wbbO deletion requires only the C-terminal domain of WbbO. A, LPS samples from whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The LPS of CWG286 containing pWQ288 provides the positive control. Cells expressing pWQ516 (ΔwbbO) are devoid of O-PS. Full-length His10-WbbO (pWQ520), as well as the separated C-terminal domain (WbbOC; pWQ529) both restore O-PS biosynthesis. B, immunofluorescence microscopy confirming surface expression of d-galactan I in cells harboring the same constructs.WbbM is classified in GT family 8 and in vitro data shows that it adds galactose residues to elongate the product of WbbO (20). However, the precise structure of the residue(s) added has not been established. WbbM is the largest galactosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of d-galactan I at 634 amino acids and 73.3 kDa (Fig. 4). His10-WbbM (74.6 kDa) is localized predominantly to the membrane fraction (Fig. 4), despite the absence of any identifiable membrane-spanning regions. Like WbbO, WbbM potentially contains two independently folding domains (WbbMN and WbbMC) with the galactosyltransferase sequence occupying the C-terminal domain. WbbMN appears to be predominantly soluble (S100), whereas WbbMC is membrane-associated (P100) (Fig. 4). This would suggest that localization of the enzyme is dictated by the C-terminal domain. However, when WbbMC was expressed in cells containing pWQ517 (ΔwbbM), no restoration of the d-galactan I biosynthesis defect was achieved (Fig. 5). In contrast, when the separated WbbMN and WbbMC domains were co-expressed as independent polypeptides in the same background, S-LPS biosynthesis was restored on the surface of the cell. These results indicate that the GT domain can fold independently into a functional peptide (at least when co-expressed with the N-terminal domain). Furthermore, both domains are required for restoration of WbbM activity in d-galactan I biosynthesis. As was the case with the ΔwbbO complementation experiments, the amount of S-LPS formed was higher when the full-length WbbM protein was used to complement the corresponding defect.Secondary structure predictions and localization of His10-WbbM. A, sequence and predicted secondary structure of WbbM outlining β-sheets (black arrows) and α-helices (black boxes). The GT-8 region (residues 284–549) is identified, as is a putative linked region that may separate two independent domains (WbbMN and WbbMC). B, localization of His10-WbbM (expressed from pWQ522 in E. coli CWG286), His10-WbbMN (pWQ530), and His10-WbbMC (pWQ531). Cell-free lysates (S12) were separated into soluble (S100) and membrane-containing (P100) fractions and the His-tagged proteins were detected in Western immunoblots using mouse anti-His5 monoclonal antibody followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Loading was standardized to the original cell suspension (prior to lysis), allowing direct visual assessment of the cellular distribution of His10-WbbM.Complementation of wbbM deletion requires both domains of WbbM. LPS samples from whole cell lysate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (upper panels). The LPS of CWG286 containing pWQ288 provides the positive control. The CWG286+pWQ517 (ΔwbbM) is devoid of O-PS but does make a modified lipid A-core species. A, full-length WbbM (pWQ522) restores O-PS biosynthesis. The corresponding immunoblot (lower panel) illustrates that in the absence of WbbM, no high molecular weight polymer is made. B, both domains are required for WbbM to functionally restore O-PS biosynthesis as illustrated by the silver stain (upper panel). The corresponding immunoblot is shown (lower panel). C, immunofluorescence microscopy confirms the surface expression of O-PS. See Fig. 3 for control immunofluorescence images.BLAST analysis identifies WbbN as a third putative galactosyltransferase. WbbN belongs to GT-2, one of the largest families within the GT-A superfamily (34, 35). Unlike WbbO and WbbM, WbbN (290 residues, 33.2 kDa) is predicted to contain a single domain (Fig. 6). An N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged protein (FLAG-WbbN) migrated in SDS-PAGE consistent with its expected size (34.2 kDa) (Fig. 6). This protein was localized predominantly to the membrane fraction.Secondary structure predictions and localization of WbbN. A, sequence and predicted secondary structure of WbbN outlining β-sheets (black arrows) and α-helices (black boxes). The GT-2 domain is located within residues 24–144. B, localization of WbbN in CWG286 overexpressing FLAG-WbbN (pWQ526). Cell-free lysates (S12) were separated into soluble (S100) and membrane-containing (P100) fractions and FLAG-WbbN was detected in Western immunoblots using an anti-FLAG monoclonal. Loading was standardized to the original cell suspension (prior to lysis), allowing direct visual assessment of the cellular distribution of FLAG-WbbN.Previous in vitro work suggested that WbbO and WbbM could together form a galactose-containing polymer (20). Although the structure (and size) of the product was not established, these results raised questions about whether WbbN participates in d-galactan I biosynthesis. To address this question, the requirement for WbbN was assessed in vivo. Plasmid pWQ548 is a derivative of pWQ288 that contains a frameshift mutation in wbbN. This is predicted to result in a truncated peptide terminating at residue 79 and therefore lacking a large portion of the GT-2 domain. This mutant is unable to produce S-LPS containing d-galactan I (Fig. 7). Introduction of plasmid pWQ527 (carrying wbbN) restored d-galactan I biosynthesis and S-LPS production. The results suggest that WbbN is indeed a galactosyltransferase and furthermore, that this enzyme is required for the synthesis of the d-galactan I polymer.WbbN is required for d-galactan I polymer synthesis. A, LPS samples from whole cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The LPS of CWG286 containing pWQ288 provides a positive control. Plasmid pWQ548 is a derivative of pWQ288 but contains a frameshift mutation in wbbN. This eliminates all synthesis of d-galactan I. Reconstitution of the system is achieved by cotransforming plasmids pWQ527 (encoding WbbN) and pWQ548, resulting in the formation of S-LPS containing d-galactan I. B, immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed surface expression of d-galactan I in CWG286 containing both pWQ527 and pWQ548.The wbbN mutant cells were pleomorphic (Fig. 7). In the absence of an ABC transporter, the four d-galactan I biosynthesis genes (in pWQ289) direct the formation of intracellular polymer (18). When a ΔwbbN version of the pWQ289 construct was examined, the cells lacked d-galactan I but had a normal cell size and shape (data not shown). Transport defects in the E. coli O9a O-PS assembly system also give rise to pleomorphic cells, which lose viability (15, 17). Although the underlying mechanisms may differ, both instances could reflect either some toxicity resulting from accumulation of d-galactan I intermediates, or depletion of the cellular pool of the essential und-P carrier, which participates in peptidoglycan biosynthesis (36).It has been assumed that the glycosyltransferases that synthesize O-PS polymer form a membrane-associated multienzyme complex but data to support this contention has been lacking for all but a very few systems. Potential binary interactions between all of the proteins involved in d-galactan I synthesis were therefore examined using both co-purification methods and a bacterial two-hybrid approach (24).For the bacterial two-hybrid assay, the T25 and T18 fragments of the catalytic domain of the B. pertussis adenylate cyclase were fused to full-length copies of each of the d-galactan I proteins. One potential advantage of this system over other two-hybrid approaches is that it does not require the interaction partners to be associated with the chromosomal DNA for the interaction to be reported. It is therefore more suited for the study of membrane (or membrane-associated) proteins (24). All of the N-terminal fusion constructs (pKT25 and pUT18C) were functional, based on complementation (restoration of d-galactan I expression) in the respective deletion mutants (data not shown).A positive interaction was considered valid when the β-galactosidase activity measured was at least two times that of the background levels measured for the vector controls (Table 2). Using these criteria, strong homotypic interactions were observed in WbbO and WbbM, but not in WbbN. These results suggest that WbbO and WbbM may form dimers (or higher order multimers) in the final complex. WbbM, WbbN, and WbbO all gave positive interaction signals with one another. Importantly, reciprocal interactions were detected when the various bait and prey combinations were reversed. The strongest inter-enzyme interaction occurred between WbbO and WbbM (Table 2).In vivo interactions between the putative galactosyltransferases involved in d-galactan I synthesisa Data were obtained from triplicate samples each done in triplicate experiments.As a further control, we investigated a second set of constructs where the T18 fragment was located at the C terminus of the galactosyltransferases and the interactions with the T25 N-terminal-tagged constructs tested (Table 2). Of these, only the WbbO-T18 construct was inactive in mutant complementation analyses (data not shown). In most cases, the results obtained were qualitatively consistent with the N-terminal-tagged derivatives. The exceptions were negative results for C-terminal-tagged WbbO-WbbN and WbbM-WbbN pairs. In each case, a positive result was obtained from the reciprocal C-terminal-tagged pair, suggesting that steric hindrance may be a factor in certain combinations. As might be expected, the absolute β-galactosidase activities varied.To support this data, pairwise combinations of galactosyltransferases were assessed for interaction by a co-purification strategy. One or both partners were epitope-tagged for detection and purification of the interacting proteins. Examination of proteins present in the bound fractions from the affinity columns (E1, E2) indicated that transferases WbbM, WbbN, and WbbO all interact with one another (Fig. 8). Thus the same result for protein-protein interactions was obtained by two radically different experimental strategies.Co-purification demonstrates interactions between WbbM, WbbN, and WbbO. Co-purification of pairwise combinations of the synthesis components of d-galactan I O-PS biosynthesis was examined in lysates from E. coli containing two plasmids expressing combinations of biosynthesis components. The protein of interest was bound to TALON metal affinity resin via a polyhistidine tag on one of the partner proteins (His6-WbbN), or to GST affinity resin via a glutathione tag (GST-WbbO). Washes were completed before buffer containing imidazole (300 mm) or glutathionine (10 mm) was added to elute the appropriately tagged protein and any interacting proteins from the resin. S, lysate added to the resin; FT, flow through; W1, wash one (10 resin volumes); W2, wash two (10 resin volumes); E1, elution one (1 resin volume); E2, elution two (1 resin volume). A, samples of 5 μl of each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Simply Blue stain. Corresponding Western blots for each partner pair are shown below the corresponding gels. B, negative controls verifying that purification of each partner protein is dependent on its interaction with His- or GST-tagged protein.Attempts were made to investigate the roles of the different domains of WbbO in protein-protein interactions, using the two-hybrid approach (Table 2). The outcome of these experiments was more complex. Some evidence was found for the interaction of WbbON with full-length WbbO, WbbM, and WbbN. In contrast, the WbbOC domain was unable to mediate any interactions sufficient for a positive result in the two-hybrid system. The simplest explanation is that WbbO contains one domain involved in catalysis (WbbOC) and another mediating both homotypic and heterotypic protein-protein interactions (WbbON). However, the negative results should be interpreted with caution because functionality in the T25-WbbOC and T18-WbbOC constructs could not be confirmed in complementation experiments (data not shown). There is no means to eliminate the possibility that these constructs are subject to improper expression and/or folding. In the case of WbbM, T18- or T25-tagged derivatives of WbbMN and WbbMC were non-functional, and these were not pursued further. It appears that maintenance of efficient expression, folding, catalysis, and interactions is too much to demand from this system when the domains are artificially separated and expressed with a substantial fusion partner.In the biosynthesis and export of d-galactan I, polymer chain length is regulated by the coordination of the ABC transporter components with the galactosyltransferases (18). The coupling of O-PS synthesis and export may be extended to other bacteria whose O antigens lack an obvious non-reducing terminal export signal, for example, Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 (37) and Vibrio cholerae O1 (38). The central requirement for coordination could be accommodated by organization of the key enzymes into a multienzyme complex. As a first step in understanding the underlying mechanism, we have identified a membrane-associated complex of galactosyltransferases involved in d-galactan I biosynthesis.In the biosynthesis of d-galactan I, WbbO, a GT-4 enzyme commits und-PP-GlcNAc to d-galactan I synthesis. It is responsible for forming the adaptor region (14, 20). Its activity is followed by WbbM (20), implicating this GT-8 enzyme as an α1,3-Galp-transferase. If correct, the GT-2 WbbN enzyme presumably completes the synthesis by providing the α1,3-Galf-transferase activity. However, there is some inconsistency between the limited in vitro available data and the essential role of WbbN unequivocally established in these in vivo studies. We are unable to explain the basis for the different results. The precise catalytic activities for these enzymes can only be established by examining each purified enzyme with the appropriate synthetic acceptor, reagents that are not currently available. However, such information is not essential for the current investigation.Although none of the three galactosyltransferases are integral membrane proteins, all target independently to the membrane. This potentially puts those enzymes in proximity to the und-PP-GlcNAc acceptor and the polymer export apparatus. The galactosyltransferases all interact with one another based on two independent experimental strategies: two-hybrid and co-purification methods. In the case of WbbO and WbbM a functional complex may contain more than one copy as these proteins form homotypic interactions. Interestingly, these interactions do not extend to Glf, the only dedicated protein involved in producing the UDP-linked precursors. No interactions were detected between Glf and WbbO, WbbM, and WbbN in two-hybrid experiments (data not shown). Logically, such interactions would not be essential given that the Glf product, UDP-Galf, is soluble and may diffuse to the site of synthesis.WbbO has been shown to have two separable domains, with only WbbOC being essential for the glycosyltransferase activity. However, the activity of this construct was low relative to the full-length protein and it was only detected in the presence of high amounts of arabinose inducer, presumably reflecting substantial overexpression. Consistent with the activity, a significant amount of WbbOC targets to the membrane independent of WbbON. WbbON apparently participates in interactions between WbbO and the other galactosyltransferases. It is tempting to speculate that this identifies a clear separation in domain functions. However, we cannot currently rule out additional interactions mediated by WbbOC. Although all of the two-hybrid experiments involving WbbOC gave negative results, the key fusion-protein constructs were functionally inactive and must be interpreted with caution.WbbM, also has two separable domains but, unlike WbbO, both domains are essential for its participation in d-galactan I biosynthesis. The CAZy GT-8 family has a relatively strong foundation of structure-function data. WbbM contains the characteristic fold and motif within the C-terminal domain. In contrast, WbbMN has no motif that would identify a catalytic activity. Interestingly, the two-domain organization and conserved N-terminal domain sequence is found in other putative GT-8 glycosyltransferases. A BLAST search identifies putative glycosyltransferases from Bifidobacterium longum sp. infantis ATCC15697 ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ACJ53443.1"",""term_id"":""213524696"",""term_text"":""ACJ53443.1""}}ACJ53443.1; 32% identity 50% similarity), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris SK11 ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ABJ72535.1"",""term_id"":""116107395"",""term_text"":""ABJ72535.1""}}ABJ72535.1; 33% identity 54% similarity), Campylobacter jejuni ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CAI38725.1"",""term_id"":""56783472"",""term_text"":""CAI38725.1""}}CAI38725.1; 29% identity, 48% similarity), and Burkholderia multivorans ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""EED99048.1"",""term_id"":""221166576"",""term_text"":""EED99048.1""}}EED99048.1; 34% identity, 52% similarity). Conservation of the N-terminal domain is consistent with its essential role in the glycosyltransferase activity of WbbM. Its function warrants further investigation given the surprising observation that trans-expression of the two WbbM domains reconstitutes WbbM (albeit with low efficiency). WbbMN is not required for membrane association of WbbMC. Unfortunately, no active fusion proteins were obtained to give insight into its possible role in protein-protein interactions.WbbN was initially assigned as a galactosyltransferase based on its Rossman-like fold, characteristic of the GT-A fold (34, 39). The frameshift mutation of wbbN in the d-galactan I cluster eliminated formation of d-galactan I, a result entirely consistent with WbbN being a galactosyltransferase involved in the overall chain extension process. In this family of GT enzymes, a DXD motif binds a catalytically important divalent metal ion (40, 41). Site-directed changes of the identified DXD motif (in WbbN this is DDD) to AAA eliminate its activity as expected (data not shown).There is growing evidence supporting multienzyme complexes in the biosynthesis of cell-surface polymers. Protein interactions have been examined by a two-hybrid approach in the group 2 capsule system of E. coli K1, which also involves export of the polymer via an ABC transporter (42). Several of the biosynthesis proteins were found to interact. In the related E. coli K5 system, recent studies of glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of the K5 capsular polysaccharide found that protein-protein interactions were essential for activity. The glucuronyltransferase activity of KfiC is dependent on physical association with the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, KfiA (43). These proteins may be part of a larger trans-envelope complex (44, 45). Interactions have also been observed between glycosyltransferases involved in wall teichoic synthesis in Bacillus subtilis 168 (46).In the only other O-PS biosynthesis system where interactions between the components have been investigated to date, E. coli O9a, three glycosyltransferases are required for O-PS biosynthesis. Two of these target to the membrane independently, whereas the third is absolutely dependent on interaction with a membrane-bound chain terminating protein (47). In the O9a system, there are no detectable inter-glycosyltransferase interactions. Comparison with the K. pneumoniae d-galactan I system suggests that membrane association is a conserved theme, as might be expected, but the manner by which this is achieved and the extent of protein-protein interactions differs significantly between systems. Notably, the O9a and d-galactan I-assembly systems also couple biosynthesis, chain termination, and export in different ways and this may be reflected in the surprisingly different interaction strategies (16,–18). The next challenge for this research field will be to provide a structural context to describe the molecular architecture of model multienzyme complexes. The characterization of these prototype systems represents the essential first step.We thank D. E. Taylor and E. Vimr for providing vector plasmids. We also thank C.

PMC2894525,The Effect of Diet on the Human Gut Microbiome: A Metagenomic Analysis in Humanized Gnotobiotic Mice,False,"Diet and nutritional status are among the most important, modifiable determinants of human health. The nutritional value of food is influenced in part by a person’s gut microbial community (microbiota) and its component genes (microbiome). Unraveling the interrelationships between diet, the structure and operations of the gut microbiota, and nutrient and energy harvest is confounded by variations in human environmental exposures, microbial ecology and genotype. To help overcome these problems, we created a well-defined, representative animal model of the human gut ecosystem by transplanting fresh or frozen adult human fecal microbial communities into germ-free C57BL/6J mice. Culture-independent, metagenomic analysis of the temporal, spatial and intergenerational patterns of bacterial colonization showed that these humanized mice were stably and heritably colonized, and reproduced much of the bacterial diversity of the donor’s microbiota. Switching from a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet to a high-fat/high-sugar “Western” diet shifted the structure of the microbiota within a single day, changed the representation of metabolic pathways in the microbiome, and altered microbiome gene expression. Reciprocal transplants involving various combinations of donor and recipient diets revealed that colonization history influences the initial structure of the microbial community, but that these effects can be rapidly altered by diet. Humanized mice fed the Western diet have increased adiposity; this trait is transmissible via microbiota transplantation. Humanized gnotobiotic mice will be useful for conducting proof-of-principle “clinical trials” that test the effects of environmental and genetic factors on the gut microbiota and host physiology.Advances in ‘next-generation’ DNA sequencing have dramatically reduced costs, and markedly increased capacity, allowing culture-independent, metagenomic methods to be readily deployed to characterize microbial communities (microbiota) associated with human body habitats, at various stages of the human lifecycle, and in various populations (1–5). These metagenomic surveys not only capture the microbial organismal and genetic diversity associated with humans, but also begin to investigate the functional contributions that our microbes make to our physiologic phenotypes, our health, and our disease predispositions. The distal gut is home to our largest number of microbes. A recent study of the fecal microbiota of adult mono- and dizygotic pairs of twins and their mothers revealed that no single, identifiable abundant (defined as representing >0.5% of the microbiota) bacterial species was shared by all 154 individuals surveyed. Nonetheless, family members had a more similar community structure than unrelated individuals. In addition, the degree of relatedness of the fecal microbiota of adult monozygotic twin pairs was not greater than that of dizygotic twin pairs (5), suggesting that early environmental exposures are important determinants of community structure. Despite interpersonal differences in bacterial species content, large collections of microbial genes are shared among unrelated individuals. This core microbiome encodes metabolic traits that benefit the host, including activities related to processing of otherwise indigestible components of the host diet, such as polysaccharides (5).A major goal of comparative human metagenomic studies is to move beyond a description of microbial species or genes present in particular habitats, and link the structure and dynamic operations of microbial communities reciprocally to human biology and pathobiology. Addressing these issues directly in humans is challenging because of numerous uncontrolled variables, both genetic and environmental.Mice raised in germ-free environments, without any exposure to microbes, and then colonized at specific life stages with different microbial communities are referred to as gnotobiotic animals, and provide an excellent system for controlling host genotype, microbial community composition, diet, and housing conditions. Microbial communities can be harvested from donor mice having defined genotypes and physiologic phenotypes and used to determine how these communities impact formerly germ-free recipients, and how the recipient affects the transplanted microbiota/microbiome. In this respect, gnotobiotic mice provide an opportunity to marry comparative metagenomic studies of donor communities with functional assays of community properties. However, there is a caveat about applying results obtained from gnotobiotic mice carrying mouse-derived microbial communities to humans: culture-independent comparisons have revealed that, although the distal gut microbiota of mice and humans harbor the same bacterial phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, TM7, Fusobacteria, and Spirochaeates), most bacterial genera and species found in mice are not seen in humans (6).To develop a more applicable mouse model, we transplanted an adult human fecal microbiota into germ-free C57BL/6J mice. A stable human gut community became established in the recipient mice similar to that of the donor. Using diet-induced obesity as a model, we show how these humanized animals can be used to conduct controlled proof-of-principle “clinical” metagenomic studies of host-microbiome interrelationships.We performed an initial colonization of young adult (5–7 week-old), male C57BL/6J mice using the microbial community present in a freshly voided fecal sample from a healthy adult human (fig. 1A). The sample was immediately placed in an anaerobic environment (Coy chamber). One aliquot of the sample was frozen, while a second was diluted in reduced PBS and an aliquot of this dilution was introduced by gavage into each of 15 recipient animals. The procedure was completed within 1h after the fecal sample was produced. The recipient mice were maintained on a standard low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet (LF/PP), in separate cages within a gnotobiotic isolator. Fecal samples were collected from these animals one day, one week, and one month after colonization, at which point half of the mice were switched to a high-fat/high-sugar Western diet. Mice from the LF/PP group and the Western diet group were kept on their respective diets for two additional months, with weekly fecal sampling, at which point they were sacrificed.(A) The initial (first-generation) humanization procedure, including the diet shift. Brown arrows indicate fecal collection time points. (B) Reciprocal microbiota transplantations. Microbiota from first-generation humanized mice fed LF/PP or Western diets were transferred to LF/PP or Western diet-fed germ-free recipients. (C) Colonization of germ-free mice starting with a frozen human fecal sample. (D) Characterization of the postnatal assembly and daily variation of the humanized mouse gut microbiota. (E) Sampling of the humanized mouse gut microbiota along the length of the gastrointestinal tract.Sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes in an ecosystem is used to identify microbes present, without the need to culture them, and to classify their evolutionary relationships. Therefore, we performed multiplex pyrosequencing of amplicons, generated by PCR from variable region 2 (V2) of bacterial 16S rRNA genes (5, 7, 8) to characterize the taxa present in the fecal communities of the two groups of humanized gnotobiotic mice (N=153 fecal samples analyzed, collected at the time points shown in fig. 1A; tables S1 and S2). Fecal and cecal samples obtained at the time of sacrifice were also characterized, as were six subsamples obtained from the original human fecal sample.We assessed the degree of similarity of the fecal microbial communities with the UniFrac metric, which is based on the degree to which any two communities share branch length on a ‘master’ phylogenetic tree constructed from all 16S rRNA sequences obtained from all communities surveyed in a study (9). Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of UniFrac-based, pairwise comparisons of community structures revealed that in mice consuming a LF/PP diet throughout the 12 week period of surveillance, the microbiota attained a sustained configuration by 28 days (d) after transplantation (fig. 2A and C). Administration of the Western diet to mice 4 weeks after colonization resulted in a shift in gut community structure that was evident after a single day and that stabilized by 7d (fig. 2A–C). Assuming an intestinal transit time of 4–6 hours (h) (10), this means that the initial diet-induced shift was evident after microbes had been exposed to the altered diet for less than 18–20h.(A) 16S rRNA gene surveys [analyzed by unweighted UniFrac-based principal coordinates analysis (PCoA)] from the human donor (green), first-generation humanized mice fed LF/PP (red) or Western (blue) diets, second-generation microbiota transplant recipients consuming the LF/PP (light blue) or Western (purple) diets, and mice humanized with a frozen sample fed LF/PP (yellow) or Western (orange) diets (total of 340 samples with >800 sequences/sample). Weighted UniFrac resulted in a similar overall clustering pattern (data not shown).

Phylogenetic analysis (fig. S1) indicated that organisms with increased representation were most closely related to Clostridium innocuum, Eubacterium dolichum, and Catenibacterium mitsuokai (all Erysipelotrichi previously isolated from the human gut). In mice fed the Western diet, Erysipelotrichi represented on average, 15.88±0.74% of 16S rRNA sequences (fig. 2B), an abundance that is significantly different than that of the community associated with mice maintained on the LF/PP diet (3.25±0.18%; P<0.01; Student’s t-test). Consumption of the Western diet was also associated with a significant increase in the relative abundance of another class of Firmicutes, the Bacilli (mainly Enterococcus) and a significant decrease in the proportional representation of members of the Bacteroidetes (P<0.01; fig. 2B and tables S3 and S4).16S rRNA surveys of fecal samples obtained from mice in both diet groups revealed that engraftment of the human gut microbiota was largely successful: all bacterial phyla, 11/12 bacterial classes, and 88% (58/66) of genus-level taxa detected in the donor sample were detected among the recipient mice (tables S3 and S4). All eight genus-level taxa that were missing from the humanized mice were present at low abundance in the donor sample (0.008% on average). Diversity in the fecal microbiota of the transplant recipients one month after colonization was not significantly (Student’s t-test) lower than in the donor sample [Shannon index of 4.53±0.15 (donor) versus 4.09±0.05 (LF/PP) and 4.51±0.04 (Western); Chao1 estimate of 1,316±295 (donor) versus 920±24 (LF/PP) and 1,055±29 (Western); a subsample of 951 sequences were randomly selected and analyzed from each dataset to control for differences in sequencing depth; also see fig. S2A].To determine whether the humanized mouse microbiota could be transmitted to a second generation of animals, and to test the relative impact of legacy effects (source of the community) versus current host diet, we used 19 week-old humanized mice maintained on the LF/PP diet or the Western diet as donors for a new set of cecal microbiota transplants. The 10 week-old germ-free C57BL/6J recipients had either been maintained on the LF/PP diet since weaning or switched to the Western diet at 6 weeks of age for four weeks, after which time they were colonized by gavage. All possible combinations of donor and recipient diet groups were examined (N=3–5 mice/treatment group; fig. 1B). Fecal microbial community structure was monitored in all recipients with multiplex V2-directed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing beginning one day after colonization and continuing weekly for a month (N=89 samples; table S1).The results indicated that the human gut microbiota could be successfully transferred from generation to generation without a significant drop in diversity, as judged by rarefaction curves (fig. S2A), the Shannon index [4.35±0.06 (LF/PP) and 4.60±0.06 (Western) compared to 4.09±0.05 (LF/PP) and 4.51±0.04 (Western) for the first-generation humanized donors], and Chao1 estimates [977±24 (LF/PP) and 1,084±36 (Western) compared to 920±24 (LF/PP) and 1,055±29 (Western) for the first-generation humanized donors; N=951 sequences per randomly selected subsample]. The overall depth of sequencing of samples obtained from second-generation animals (that is the number of V2 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencer reads collected) was 2-fold lower compared to samples from first-generation samples. Nonetheless, the second-generation microbiota shared at least 83% of the class-level taxa and 73% of the genus-level taxa with the first-generation community (tables S3 and S4).UniFrac-based PCoA revealed that the microbiota in recipients consuming a Western diet assumed a phylogenetically similar composition regardless of the diet of the donor mouse. Moreover, samples taken from mismatched donor/recipient diet groups (LF/PP donor and Western recipient or vice versa) displayed intermediate clustering and taxonomy after the first day, but clustered according to recipient diet after one week (fig. 2A,B and fig. S3). As with the first-generation recipients, the Western diet-associated microbiota had significantly higher representation of members of the Firmicute classes Erysipelotrichi and Bacilli (Enterococcus), accompanied by a reduction in the proportional representation of the Bacteroidetes (fig. 2B; tables S3 and S4). Together, these results indicate that legacy effects (that is, colonization history) can play a role in determining the initial community structure after transfer, but that these effects are quickly replaced by the diet of the recipient host.We next determined whether humanization with a frozen fecal sample would result in similar diversity as colonization with a fresh sample. Therefore, ten 10 week-old germ-free C57BL/6J mice were colonized with the same fecal sample used for the initial humanization except that it had been stored at −80°C for over one year. Five weeks after colonization, half of the mice were switched to the Western diet and sacrificed 2 weeks later (N=5 mice/group) (study design illustrated in fig. 1C). Fecal microbial community structure was monitored in all recipients using multiplex V2-directed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, beginning 8h after colonization (N=92 samples; table S5).Fecal samples obtained from recipients 8h after inoculation had low diversity (fig. S2B), clustered separately (fig. 2A and fig. S3), and had a higher representation of Erysipelotrichi (47.97±1.99% of 16S rRNA sequences; fig. 2B) compared to recipients of the fresh sample. However, as with humanization using the fresh sample, the microbiota stabilized after 7d, with a level of diversity approaching that of the donor (fig. 2A,B and fig. S2B). All bacterial phyla, 11/12 bacterial classes, and 85% (56/66) of genus-level taxa detected in the frozen donor sample were found in the recipient mouse population (tables S3 and S4). Of the ten genus-level taxa that were missing from the humanized mice, one was found at 0.1% relative abundance in the original donor sample (Firmicutes; Clostridia; Clostridiales; Veillonellaceae; Acidaminococcus) and the rest were all at low abundance in the sample (0.006% on average). Switching mice to a Western diet significantly increased the Erysipelotrichi and significantly decreased the Bacteroidetes; these changes were evident within 1d day of the diet switch (fig. 2A,B; table S3). Our results show that it is possible to humanize germ-free animals by using frozen fecal samples.We used our humanized gnotobiotic mice to characterize two aspects of the human gut microbiota that are not currently feasible in humans: (i) postnatal assembly of the microbial community under controlled conditions; and (ii) the impact of a diet perturbation on the spatial organization of the microbial community along the entire length of a gut undisturbed by any of the bowel cleansing protocols commonly used before human endoscopic sampling.We therefore performed a 16S rRNA gene-based survey of fecal specimens obtained from humanized mice beginning at postnatal day 14 (P14), a time when adequate amounts of (fecal) microbial biomass are first available for characterization of individual samples, through P85 (N=146 samples with ≥500 sequences/sample; table S6). The study design is summarized in fig. 1D. Mice (N=6) delivered by a humanized mother were subsequently co-housed with their mother, weaned onto the LF/PP diet beginning at P21 and, once weaned (P28), individually caged in the same gnotobiotic isolator until P57, at which time they were switched to the Western diet, and samples taken for another 28d.From P14 to P24, the gut microbiota exhibited an increase in bacterial diversity (fig. 3A) and a marked shift in the relative abundance of multiple bacterial classes. Notably, there was a decrease in γ-Proteobacteria and Bacilli, which together comprise 81.44±8.48% of the fecal microbiota between P14-P18 and an increase in the Bacteroidetes (fig. 3B and fig. S4A,B). The microbiota assumed an adult-like configuration by P21-P28 (fig. 3B). This configuration stably persisted as judged by pairwise comparisons of UniFrac distances between fecal samples collected daily from P30-P44 (fig. 1D and fig. S4C).(A) Rarefaction curves measuring bacterial diversity in the fecal communities (species-level phylotypes defined by ≥97% identity). The curves are based on V2 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from mice prior to weaning (P14) and after weaning (P28). Values are mean±95% CI. (B) Taxonomic distribution [RDP level 3 (27)] of the gut microbiota sampled from mice from postnatal days P14 to P85. Values represent the average relative abundance across all samples within a given group.We next defined spatial variations in the microbiota along the length of the gastrointestinal tract of humanized mice consuming a LF/PP or a Western diet, as outlined in fig. 1E. Adult mice were sacrificed, and their small intestines were divided into 16 equal length segments and their ceca and colons were separated into two halves. We obtained fecal samples, and samples from the luminal contents of the stomach, small intestinal segments 1 (most proximal), 2, 5, 9, 13, and 15, and the proximal and distal halves of the cecum and colon. Luminal contents were sampled by perfusing the segments with buffer. The luminal surface of each perfused segment was then swabbed with a culture loop to sample the mucosa-adherent community (see SM and table S7; N=148 samples subjected to multiplex pyrosequencing of V2-derived 16S rRNA amplicons; >500 reads/sample; total of 8 animals surveyed).Communities from comparably positioned segments of the gut in mice consuming the same diet were similar (P<10−4 based on a G-test of shared phylotypes, defined as ≥97% sequence identity) but we did not detect a significant difference between samples taken from perfused luminal contents and from the swabbed mucosa (P>0.05, G-test of shared phylotypes). Microbial community structure was impacted by location along the cephalocaudal axis (fig. 4a). Notably, there was a dramatic increase in the percent representation of Bacteroidetes as one moved from the small intestine to the cecum, colon, and feces (13.71±1.40% for the stomach/small intestine samples versus an average of 42.33±1.67% for the cecal/colonic/fecal samples; P<10−10, Student’s t-test). Additionally, the overall level of diversity was region-dependent, ranging from lowest levels in the proximal intestine, to the highest levels in the colon and feces (fig. S2C). The Western diet was associated with significantly increased levels of Bacilli and Erysipelotrichi along the entire length of the gut compared to the LF/PP diet (fig. 4B; P<10−6, Student’s t-test). Although the relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes in the cecum and feces was comparable on the LF/PP diet [40.15±2.17% (feces) versus 45.43±1.83% (cecum)], it was significantly lower in fecal samples taken from mice fed the Western diet (fig. 2B and ​and4B)4B) (16.56±2.26% in the feces versus 44.50±2.05% in the cecum across three experiments; P<10−10, Student’s t-test).(A) 16S rRNA gene surveys (analyzed by unweighted UniFrac PCoA) of the humanized microbiota along the length of the gut (N=148 samples with >500 sequences/sample). Weighted UniFrac results in a similar overall clustering pattern. PC1 and PC2 are the x- and y-axis respectively. Percent variance is shown in parentheses. (B) Taxonomic distribution [RDP level 3 (27)] in communities distributed along the length of the gut. Values represent the average relative abundance across all samples within a given group.The studies described above, including the reciprocal microbiota transplants, allowed us to rationally select time points to sample the gut microbiome in two dietary contexts. In addition, by demonstrating the consistency in microbiota composition between humanized adult mice on a given diet, they provided justification for pooling fecal samples obtained at given time points before and after diet switches so that we could obtain sufficient microbial biomass for direct shotgun sequencing of the microbiome. Therefore, to characterize microbiome gene composition samples were analyzed in 10 pools, each pool representing 3–5 mice sampled at 1d, 7d, or 28d after the human fecal transplant, plus 1d and 1 week after the switch to the Western diet (the same sampling/pooling protocol was applied to members of the control group who remained on the LF/PP diet). DNA isolated from the freshly voided human sample used for the microbiota transplant was also analyzed. Combined, 479,495 reads were generated (average of 43,590±2,246 reads per sample; average length 224 nt/read; table S8). After removing low quality and replicate sequences, microbiomes were annotated using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database [version 44 (11)] and a custom database of 122 reference human gut genomes (table S9 and SM).Clustering of microbial communities based on their gene content revealed a pattern similar to that observed with the 16S rRNA datasets (fig. 2A and fig. 5A). Samples taken one day after humanization had the most divergent microbiome gene content, while samples taken one week after colonization clustered with the human donor sample. Remarkably, a clear shift in gene content was evident 1d after the switch to the Western diet (fig 5A). The Western diet-associated fecal microbiome was enriched for a number of KEGG pathways involved in nutrient processing, including those for ABC transporters and Phosphotransferase Systems (PTS) (table 1). ABC transporters included those predicted to be involved in sugar, amino acid, and cofactor import, while PTS included predicted transporters for fructose, N-acetylgalactosamine, cellobiose, and mannose (table S10).Microbiome/transcriptome profiles were normalized by z-score, used to construct a correlation distance matrix, clustered with UPGMA, and visualized (see SM; Matlab v7.7.0). (A) Clustering of fecal microbial gene content in the human donor’s microbiome and two groups of humanized mice starting at day one post colonization (N=3–5 mice/group; fecal DNA was pooled prior to sequencing).

Black circles represent validated clusters (inconsistency threshold=0.75, ‘cluster’ function in Matlab v7.7.0). dpc, days post colonization with a human donor sample; dpd, days post diet switch. (D) qRT-PCR validation of C. innocuum SB23 gene expression in humanized mice (N=3–5 samples/group; see SM). Mean values±SEM are plotted (*P<0.05, Student’s t-test).Metabolic pathways altered by diet in the humanized mouse gut microbiome*.The LF/PP diet-associated microbiome was enriched for pathways that are also enriched in the Bacteroidetes (5), including N-glycan degradation, sphingolipid metabolism, and glycosaminoglycan degradation (table 1). Thus, this profile is consistent with the increased representation of Bacteroidetes in the LF/PP compared to Western diet fecal microbiome (fig. 2B).Administration of a Western diet to humanized mice produced a significant increase in adiposity compared to age- and gender-matched humanized mice consuming the LF/PP diet (epididymal fat pad weight, 2.29±0.15% versus 1.42±0.05% of body weight; N=5–8 mice/treatment group; 2 independent experiments; P<0.05, Student’s t-test; figure 6a).(A) The effects of Western and LF/PP diets on epididymal fat pad weight (expressed as a percentage of total body weight) in humanized gnotobiotic mice (N=5–8 mice/group; N=2 independent groups). (B) Percent increase in total body fat (measured by DEXA) after colonization of germ-free mice with a microbiota harvested from humanized donors fed the Western or the LF/PP diet (N=4–5 mice/group). Recipients were fed a LF/PP diet. Mean values±SEM are plotted (*P<0.05, Student’s t-test).Our previous microbiota transplantation studies demonstrated that distal gut communities harvested from genetically obese ob/ob mice (12), or conventionally-raised wild-type C57BL6/J mice who were obese because of consumption of the Western diet (13), produced a greater increase in adiposity in adult germ-free recipient mice, within two weeks, compared to communities that had been donated by lean LF/PP-fed controls.We performed a comparable experiment to functionally characterize the gut microbiota of humanized mice with diet-induced obesity. Germ-free C57BL/6J recipients were colonized for two weeks with cecal microbial communities harvested from humanized donors fed the LF/PP or Western diets (N=1 donor and N=4–5 recipient mice/group). The two groups of recipients were matched at the start of the experiment for age, weight, body fat (21.9±0.2 vs. 22.1±0.3 g body weight, and 9.6±0.3 vs. 9.5±0.6% total body fat) and diet (LF/PP). There was no significant difference in chow consumption between the two groups of recipient mice (15.3±0.3 vs. 15.2±0.4 kcal/d over the entire experiment; there was also no significant difference during the first or second week when considered separately). Mice colonized with a microbiota from obese Western diet-fed humanized donors gained significantly more adiposity during the two weeks following transplantation than did mice colonized with the humanized microbiota from LF/PP-fed donors (68.5±8.2% versus 34.5±3.7% increase in total body fat; P<0.05, Student’s t-test) (fig. 6B).Our humanized gnotobiotic mouse model also allows the identification of previously uncharacterized lineages of the human gut microbiota. We sought to (i) recover a microbe belonging to the Erysipelotrichi taxa that bloomed in Western diet-fed mice, (ii) define its genome sequence, (iii) compare the isolate’s sequence to that of members of this population in the humanized mouse gut microbiome in order to identify polymorphic regions and, finally, (iv) compare the isolate’s transcriptome and the meta-transcriptome expressed by the gut microbial community of humanized mice consuming a Western or LF/PP diet.After humanized mice were on the Western diet for over two months, cecal contents were isolated under anaerobic conditions, diluted, and plated on rich medium under strictly anaerobic conditions (see SM). RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) screening, followed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing allowed us to identify four isolates belonging to Erysipelotrichi out of a total of 17 colonies screened. We sequenced the genome of one of the isolates, which shared 98% identity with the 16S rRNA gene of Clostridium innocuum ATCC14501 (table S11). Annotation of this strain’s genome (designated C. innocuum strain SB23) with the RAST annotation server (14) revealed 245 predicted PTS and 115 ABC transporter genes. Annotation of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) using procedures implemented for the CAZy database (15) yielded 78 predicted CAZymes, including 21 genes in the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 1 (candidate 6P-β-glycosidases), 3 genes in glycoside hydrolase family 4 (candidate 6P-glycosidases), 10 genes in glycosyltransferase family 2 (candidate β-glycosyltransferases), and 2 genes in glycoside hydrolase family 32 (candidate β-fructosidases potentially capable of degrading sucrose, a major component of the Western diet). The enrichment for GH1 in C. innocuum SB23 is particularly striking when compared to other annotated human gut-associated bacterial genomes (no genes in 13 sequenced human gut Bacteroidetes; ≤5 genes from each of 14 human gut Firmicutes (P<0.01, z-score=21; table S12). In contrast, the profile of glycosyltransferases in this strain is more typical of other gut Firmicutes.To investigate genome-wide sequence variation in the in vivo SB23 population, we compared our gut microbiome shotgun sequences to the cultured SB23 isolate’s genome. 96% of the reads that aligned to the reference genome aligned at ≥90% identity. Moreover, 97% of the aligned reads were aligned across ≥90% of their length (see SM and fig. S5). Together, these findings indicate that there is only a low level of sequence variation for the SB23 population in the humanized mouse microbiome.Using a method for rRNA depletion of total cecal RNA together with an Illumina GAII sequencer, we compared mRNAs expressed by the genes represented in the SB23 genome in the LF/PP versus Western diet-associated cecal microbiota (N=3–4 mice/group; see SM and table S13). The results revealed distinct clustering of the SB23 transcriptomes expressed in humanized mice consuming the Western versus the LF/PP diet (fig 5B). Cyber-T analysis (16) disclosed 69 genes that were significantly upregulated on the Western diet (table S14). Two upregulated PTS genes were included in this dataset (SB23peg3102, 4.8-fold; SB23peg2651, 8-fold). Sequence homology suggests that SB23peg2651 may preferentially import simple sugars (glucose and fructose that together comprise sucrose, a common component of the Western diet) and/or sugars associated with host mucosa (N-acetyl-galactosamine). Genes involved in basic carbohydrate metabolism were also upregulated, including pyruvate formate-lyase (SB23peg2932; 9.5-fold), phosphoglycerate kinase (SB23peg1427; 8.8-fold), and 6-phosphofructokinase (SB23peg2154; 3.5-fold; see table S14). qRT-PCR assays were used to confirm several of these results, including the significant upregulation of phosphoglycerate kinase and two PTS genes on the Western diet, plus a significant upregulation of β-fructosidase on the LF/PP diet (fig. 5D and table S15).To obtain a broader view of the transcriptional responses of the microbiome to diet shifts, we compared cDNA sequences generated from rRNA-depleted RNAs isolated from the ceca of humanized mice sacrificed 8 weeks after shifting to a Western diet to those from control animals maintained on the LF/PP diet, using a custom database of 122 sequenced human gut genomes (all protein-encoding genes from the 122 genomes were grouped into clusters; table S13 and SM). Clustering of meta-transcriptomes revealed a clear difference between gene expression in the microbiomes from animals on the LF/PP versus Western diet (fig. 5C). A Cyber-T analysis (see SM) revealed 520 gene clusters that were differentially expressed between the two diets (fold-change ≥4; table S16). 148 clusters containing C. innocuum SB23 genes were upregulated on the Western diet, including clusters encoding the previously noted Western diet-associated transcripts [pyruvate formate-lyase (SB23peg2932), a PTS predicted to be involved in fructose/mannose/N-acetygalactosamine import (SB23peg2651-2652), plus phosphoglycerate kinase (SB23peg1427)]. Additionally, 349 clusters without predicted C. innocuum SB23 gene products were upregulated on the Western diet, including 10 Firmicute gene clusters encoding ABC-type sugar transport systems. Twenty-three clusters (21 from Bacteroides genomes) were upregulated on the LF/PP diet, including a predicted β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, and malate/lactate dehydrogenase (table S16).Together, these results demonstrate that humanized gnotobiotic mice can be used to conduct controlled, comparative metagenomic studies of how the human gut microbiota and its microbiome adapts in composition and function to defined changes in diet.The idea of transplanting human gut communities into germ-free animals is longstanding (17–22). However, we have now used newly available metagenomic methods to demonstrate that (i) a human distal gut microbiota can be transferred to germ-free mice with remarkable preservation of structure and diversity, even if the starting material is frozen feces, (ii) the community can subsequently be reliably transmitted from mothers to their offspring, (iii) the microbiota in these humanized mice has characteristic and reproducible variations in its composition along the length of the gut, and (iv) the configuration of the microbiota, its microbiome and meta-transcriptome change in a rapid, dramatic and reproducible fashion after switching from a plant polysaccharide-rich/low fat diet to a high-fat/high-sugar Western diet. We also show that a host phenotype, Western diet-induced increased adiposity, can be transmitted for a period of time to recipient gnotobiotic mice via transplantation of their gut microbiota. Together, these findings establish the justification for a translational medicine pipeline for conducting proof-of-principle and proof-of-mechanism clinical metagenomic studies where the impact of representative human microbiomes on host biology can be initially characterized in mice consuming diets resembling those of the humans being studied, and where the effects of various environmental exposures (e.g., foods, xenobiotics, etc.), and host genotypes on the dynamic operations of their gut microbial communities can be modeled under controlled conditions.The phylogenetic tree of bacterial life in the gut consists primarily of shallow twigs that represent species- or genus-level diversity: these twigs stem back to a few deep splits near the base of the tree that represent the dominant phyla present in this body habitat (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria). This phylogenetic structure contrasts with other ecosystems such as the soil, where there are many deep branches of the tree represented (23), and suggests that the gut selects for diversification in the few deep evolutionary lineages that flourish there. Microbiota transplants into germ-free mice living in gnotobiotic isolators where inadvertent contact with microorganisms living in the world outside of the isolator is avoided allow us to consider the selective forces that operate to assemble a gut community. We had previously attempted to transplant a foreign gut microbiota into adult germ-free mouse recipients, where the donors were conventionally raised zebrafish. Members of the donor gut community that most closely resembled the phylogenetic lineages normally present in the mouse gut microbiota survived in the mouse intestine, as judged by 16S rRNA surveys of the input (donor) community and selected recipient communities (24). The factors that operated to select these phylotypes were not defined. The results from reciprocal microbiota transplants performed in the current study, in which various combinations of donor and host diets were tested, demonstrate that although the initial environmental exposure (legacy effect) affects early community composition, diet can supersede legacy effects and shape the composition of the microbiota and microbiome as well as its expressed gene repertoire. The ability of a fecal human community to establish and sustain itself in the intestines of adult germ-free mice with a unanticipated level of preservation of microbial diversity likely reflects the confluence of a number of factors, ranging from the initial openness of the germ-free mouse’s gut ecosystem, diet (including endogenous nutrient substrates available in the gut habitat such as mucus glycans which are readily foraged by members of the Bacteroidetes and shared with other components of the community) (25, 26), the relative immaturity of the innate and adaptive immune systems at the time of initial colonization, the fact that mice are coprophagic which allows repeated microbial inoculation, and the implicit notion that there must be a large number of shared features of the biochemical milieus of the mouse and human gut that have yet to be defined.Our metagenomic analyses of humanized gnotobiotic mice also disclosed that in adult mice, community composition is dramatically altered over a time scale of hours when animals are switched from mouse chow to a Western diet. This bloom in members of the Erysipelotrichi and Bacilli classes of the Firmicutes occurred along the length of the gut. These findings have several implications. First, they indicate that it is possible to identify diets having large effects on the gut microbiota and microbiome over short time intervals using humanized mice, and that subsequent testing of the effects of these diets on humans could involve study designs where diet exposures do not have to be prolonged. Second, the ability to apply a diet selection to identify organisms that bloom in the microbiota of humanized mice, and then to recover these organisms and characterize their attributes in silico, in vitro and in vivo (in gnotobiotic mice) represents an attractive pipeline for the discovery of new classes of probiotics that affect nutrient harvest in a given diet context.A previous study demonstrated that the ability to produce equol from a soy-isoflavone containing diet could be transmitted to germ-free rats upon colonization with a fecal sample from a high equol-producing human subject, but not with a sample from a low equol-producing individual (22). Our experiments show the feasibility of applying metagenomic methods, including microbial community mRNA profiling (meta-transcriptomics) to microbiota transplantation experiments in order to begin to understand the microbial organismal and microbial genetic basis of how a human metabolic phenotype (metabotype) can be transferred via the gut microbiota. A key finding from our study is that similar microbial communities can be formed in gnotobiotic recipients using fresh and frozen aliquots of a human donor’s fecal sample. The fact that diversity can be captured after collected samples are quickly frozen and then stored at −80°C for almost a year not only reflects the capacity of strict anaerobes to survive freeze-thaw cycles but also speaks to the ability of the gut to select and support the rapid expansion of adapted organisms that may be present in only small numbers in a sample subjected to prolonged storage at this temperature. The ability to use frozen fecal samples has broad implications for human microbiome projects focusing on the gut ecosystem, since it means that humans populations with various physiologic or pathophysiologic states can be sampled, their biospecimens archived, and the functional attributes of their microbial communities compared and contrasted both in silico based on metagenomic datasets, and experimentally in humanized gnotobiotic mice. In cases where the focus is on the interrelationships between diet, gut microbial ecology and nutrient/energy harvest in obese or underfed populations living in various cultural contexts, recreating both the microbiotas and diets of the studied populations in humanized gnotobiotic mice should yield more relevant and personalized animal models. Microbial-based biomarkers can be discovered and validated, and therapeutic tests performed in these animals before they are translated to human studies, or in more sublime way, these mice can become part of a clinical study. Finally, the successful transfer of a human gut microbiota across generations of mice without a significant drop in diversity creates a model for addressing a very intriguing question in genetics: does intergenerational transfer of a microbiome, like methylation, RNAi, and other short-term heritable influences, explain effects ‘induced by the environment’ that last a small number of generations?All experiments involving mice were performed using protocols approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Germ-free adult male C57BL/6J mice were maintained in plastic gnotobiotic isolators under a strict 12 hr light cycle and fed an autoclaved low-fat, polysaccharide-rich chow diet (LF/PP; B&K autoclavable diet 7378000) ad libitum. Humanization was performed by diluting a freshly voided human fecal sample (1g) in 10mL reduced PBS, under anaerobic conditions. The fecal material was then suspended by vortexing, and 0.2mL of the suspension introduced by gavage, into each germ-free recipient. A similar procedure was used for a frozen fecal subsample, which was homogenized with a mortar and pestle while frozen prior to dilution. Mice were subsequently maintained in separate cages in a gnotobiotic isolator, and fed a LF/PP or a high-fat/high-sugar Western diet (Harlan-Teklad TD96132) ad libitum.To define total body fat content, animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (10 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg), and subjected to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DEXA; Lunar PIXImus Mouse, GE Medical Systems; (12)]. Epidydymal fat pad weights were also used as a biomarker of adiposity.Procedures used for (i) gut microbial community DNA preparation, (ii) sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, (iii) isolation of C. innocuum strain SB23, (iv) pyrosequencing of total community DNA and the C. innocuum SB23 genome, (v) C. innocuum strain SB23 genome annotation and metabolic reconstruction, (vi) database searches and in silico microbiome metabolic reconstructions, (vii) meta-transcriptomics (RNA-Seq), (viii) qRT-PCR, and (ix) statistical analyses, are described in SM.We thank D.

PMC2895552,Identifying genetic determinants needed to establish a human gut symbiont in its habitat,False,"The human gut microbiota is a metabolic organ whose cellular composition is determined by a dynamic process of selection and competition. To identify microbial genes required for establishment of human symbionts in the gut, we developed an approach (insertion-sequencing, or INSeq) based on a mutagenic transposon that allows capture of adjacent chromosomal DNA to define its genomic location. We used massively parallel sequencing to monitor the relative abundance of tens of thousands of transposon mutants of a saccharolytic human gut bacterium, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, as they established themselves in wild-type and immunodeficient gnotobiotic mice, in the presence or absence of other human gut commensals. In vivo selection transforms this population, revealing functions necessary for survival in the gut: we show how this selection is influenced by community composition and competition for nutrients (vitamin B12). INSeq provides a broadly applicable platform to explore microbial adaptation to the gut and other ecosystems.Our indigenous microbial communities play critical roles in shaping myriad features of our biology. The distal gut hosts the majority of our microbes; these include representatives of all three domains of life, plus their viruses. The density of organisms occupying this habitat is astonishing, exceeding 1012 cells/mL. Most phylogenetic types (phylotypes) observed in the guts of humans and other mammals belong to just two bacterial divisions (phyla) - the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes (Ley et al., 2008). Microbial community (microbiota) exchange experiments indicate that gut community members are dynamically selected: for example, transplantation of a Proteobacteria-dominated zebrafish gut microbiota into germ-free mice transforms this community so that it comes to resemble a mouse gut microbiota, while transplantation of a mouse microbiota into germ-free zebrafish has the opposite effect, yielding a community that has the phylum-level characteristics of the native zebrafish microbiota (Rawls et al., 2006).Within the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, hundreds to thousands of phylotypes partition available niches (professions) to create a community able to maintain itself in this continuously perfused ecosystem despite shifts in host diet, regular ingestion of foreign bacteria, intense resource competition, high bacteriophage levels, and immune surveillance. Comparisons of the sequenced genomes of cultured representatives of major gut phylogenetic lineages provide a means for identifying genomic features potentially important for colonization and competition in the gut. However, the recent surge in microbial genome sequencing projects has far outpaced development of broadly applicable tools for directly testing the role of genes in determining fitness in this habitat. The paucity of tools is unfortunate, as fundamental questions connecting genome content to function remain unexplored. For example, how are the determinants of fitness related to nutrient availability and how closely do the genes required for fitness in vivo mirror those required for maximizing growth rate in vitro? Does community structure influence this map of genetic requirements, or is competition largely ‘within species’? Do the major recognized components of the host immune system play a dominant role in determining which genes are critical for symbiont fitness in vivo? To address these questions, we integrated a simple and broadly applicable genetic tool with second-generation DNA sequencers and gnotobiotic mouse models to identify fitness determinants in the genome of a human gut mutualist.Mariner transposon mutagenesis is an attractive forward genetic strategy for connecting phenotype to gene because stable random insertions can be generated in a recipient genome without specific host factors: the ability of these transposons to serve as mutagenic agents is well established in members of all three domains of life (Lampe et al., 1996; Mazurkiewicz et al., 2006). After alignment of the inverted repeat (IR) sequences that delimit mariner family transposons, we noted that a single G–T transversion at a nonconserved position would create a recognition sequence for the Type IIs restriction enzyme, MmeI. When directed to this location, MmeI would cleave 16 bp outside of the transposon, capturing a genomic fragment that identifies the insertion site. Moreover, if the genome sequence of the recipient organism were known, the short genomic DNA sequences captured by this MmeI digestion would be sufficient to uniquely map transposon location. We reasoned that in a mixed population of transposon mutants produced in a given recipient bacterial species, the relative abundance of each MmeI-liberated genomic fragment, identified after limited PCR amplification and massively parallel sequencing, would in principle mirror the abundance of each mutant in the population. Putting this population under potentially selective conditions (e.g. colonization of the intestines of gnotobiotic mice) could then be used to highlight mutants that change in relative abundance, and thereby identify genes and pathways critical for fitness under these conditions (Figure 1A).(A) A negative selection scheme for identification of genes required for colonization in vivo. Mutants in genes important for competitive growth (red) are expected to decrease in relative abundance in the output population. (B) Preparation of an INSeq library. Genomic DNA is extracted from the mutagenized bacterial population, digested with MmeI, and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Transposon-sized fragments are appended with double-stranded oligonucleotide adapters by ligation. Limited cycles of PCR create the final library molecules for sequencing. (C) Map of insertion sites in the B. thetaiotaomicron genome. An arrow marks the origin of replication. (D) Reproducibility of library preparation and sequencing protocols. Technical replicates were prepared and sequenced from a single transposon mutant population. Each point represents the abundance of insertions in a single gene; the coefficient of determination, R2, on log-transformed abundance values is 0.92.Using this insertion-sequencing (INSeq) approach, we subjected a mutagenized population of the prominent human gut symbiont, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, to varying selective pressures: in vitro growth in continuous flow chemostats, monoassociation of wild-type and knockout germ-free mice lacking major branches of their innate or acquired immune systems, and as one component of several defined communities of human gut-derived microbes. The results provide evidence that human gut symbionts, like their pathogenic counterparts, possess dedicated mechanisms critical for interaction with their host and each other. The relative importance of these mechanisms is not static, but instead shaped by other members of the microbiota. As a strategy for functional characterization of newly sequenced genomes in general, and of the human gut microbiome in particular, INSeq extends existing techniques in several important aspects.We constructed pSAM, a sequencing-adapted mariner transposon delivery vector with three major features: an antibiotic resistance cassette flanked by MmeI-modified mariner inverted repeats, a multiple cloning site immediately upstream of the himar1C9 mariner transposase (Lampe et al., 1999), and machinery for replication in the donor strain and transfer by conjugation (Figure S1A–C). B. thetaiotaomicron was chosen as the recipient species to test this approach for several reasons (Figure S2A). First, it is highly adapted to life in the distal human gut (Zocco et al., 2007). A prominent member of the gut microbiota, this mutualist is richly endowed with a broad arsenal of genes encoding glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases not represented in the human genome (Xu et al., 2003). These genes are incorporated together with genes encoding nutrient sensors and carbohydrate transporters into 88 polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) representing 18% of organism’s genome (Martens et al., 2008). Thus equipped, B. thetaiotaomicron functions as a flexible forager of otherwise indigestible dietary glycans, as well as host glycans when dietary polysaccharides are not available (Martens et al., 2008). Second, >200 GeneChip datasets of B. thetaiotaomicron’s transcriptome have been collected during growth in vitro under a variety of conditions, after mono-colonization of germ-free mice fed different diets, as well as after co-colonization with another human gut bacterial or archaeal species (NCBI GEO archive). Third, functional genomic studies conducted in gnotobiotic mice have shown that monoassociation with B. thetaiotaomicron can recapitulate a number of host responses evoked by a complete mouse gut microbiota. Fourth, a limited number of in vivo competition experiments conducted in gnotobiotic mice colonized with isogenic wild-type and mutant B. thetaiotaomicron have identified a few fitness determinants that could serve as reference controls for the present study (Peterson et al., 2007).We found that transfer of the MmeI-modified mariner transposon into the genome of B. thetaiotaomicron occurs with high efficiency (Figure S2). To identify the site of transposon insertion and the relative abundance of each mutant in an otherwise isogenic population, we developed a straightforward procedure to extract the two 16-bp genomic sequences adjacent to each transposon, append sequencing adapters to these fragments, and separate the desired molecules from genomic background (Figure 1B and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Sequencing these tags using an Illumina Genome Analyzer II produced ~8 million raw reads from a single flowcell lane: ~90% of these reads contained the transposon (Figure S2D). We designed a software package, MapSAM, to filter out low-quality sequences, quantify and pair reads generated from either side of an insertion, and assign these paired reads to a specific location in the target genome (Figure 1C). Examination of technical replicates indicated that the library preparation, sequencing, and mapping strategies were highly reproducible (Figures 1D and S3). The proportion of reads that were unambiguously mapped (98%) matched predictions from an in silico model of random transposon insertion (Figure S4A); no insertion sequence bias beyond the expected ‘TA’ dinucleotide requirement (Bryan et al., 1990) was apparent (Figure S4B, C).We first characterized a mutant population containing ~35,000 B. thetaiotaomicron transposon insertion strains. Insertions were well distributed across the genome at an average density of 5.5 insertions/kb (Figure 1C). After filtering out insertions in the distal (3′) 10% of any coding region (because such insertions could possibly still permit gene function) we found that 3435 of the 4779 predicted open reading frames in the genome (72%) had been directly disrupted in the mutant population. Inclusion of genes disrupted by upstream (polar) mutations in a predicted operon increased this number to 78%; rarefaction analysis suggested this population is approaching saturation (Figure S4D).To identify B. thetaiotaomicron genes unable to tolerate transposon insertion, we generated and mapped a second, independent mutant population. We combined both data sets and applied a Bayesian model to account for the number of informative insertion sites in each gene (Lamichhane et al., 2003). The results yielded a conservative list of 325 candidate essential genes for growth under anaerobic conditions when plated onto rich (tryptone-yeast extract-glucose; TYG) medium (Table S1). These genes were significantly enriched (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p<0.05) for Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) categories representing cell division (category D), lipid transport/metabolism (I), translation/ribosomal structure/biogenesis (J), and cell wall/membrane biogenesis (M). This is consistent with genome-wide mutagenesis studies of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Baba et al., 2006; Jacobs et al., 2003). For non-essential genes, insertion frequency showed some correlation (R2 of log-transformed values = 0.33) with GeneChip-defined expression levels during mid-log phase growth of the parental wild-type strain in batch fermentors containing rich TYG medium (Figure S4E). The reason for this relationship is not known, although studies of mariner transposition in vitro suggest that the enzyme has a preference for bent or bendable DNA (Lampe et al., 1998).A mutant population of this complexity contains insertions in most of the coding potential of the genome and can facilitate forward genetic approaches for identifying genotypes connected with a phenotype of interest. These mixed populations, however, are less amenable to reverse genetics: specific genotypes are not individually retrievable. Arrayed transposon mutant collections, in which strains of known genotype are archived individually, provide an important avenue for retrieval and further study of specific strains of interest. To date, such collections have been created using a strain-by-strain procedure that typically consists of cell lysis, removal of cellular debris, multiple rounds of semi-random or single-primer PCR, DNA cleanup, and individual Sanger sequencing of each amplicon. As an alternative, we developed a combinatorial technique for simultaneously mapping thousands of individually archived transposon mutant strains in parallel (Figures 2A, S5, and Supplemental Experimental Procedures).(A) Individual strains are archived in a 96-well format and then placed into a subset of 24 pools according to a unique 24-bit binary string assigned to each strain. Sub-libraries are prepared from each of these pools using one of 24 pool-specific barcoded dsDNA adapters in the ligation step. Sub-libraries are then combined and sequenced in a single run. Reads mapping to a specific insertion location are compiled and the associated pool-specific barcodes are identified to recreate the 24-bit string (and with it, the physical location of the corresponding strain in the archived collection). (B) Sample pool distribution patterns for archived strains. Strains are placed in pools designated with white boxes and omitted from pools marked with black boxes. The 13,000 patterns generated are each distinct in at least six positions and do not overlap to produce another pattern in the set. (C) Confirmation of strain-insertion assignments.This approach consists of three basic steps: (1) culturing and archived storage of randomly picked mutant colonies in individual wells of 96-well (or higher density) plates; (2) placement of each of these strains into pools in unique patterns; and (3) sequencing of these pools by INSeq in order to associate each transposon insertion location with a strain in the original arrayed multi-well plates. Because n pools can contain 2n unique presence/absence patterns, a small number of pools can uniquely identify a large number of strains. To this end, a benchtop liquid handling robot was used to distribute archived transposon mutant strains across a subset of pools in a pattern selected to minimize the likelihood of mistaking one strain for another or incorrectly mapping clonal strains (Figure 2B and Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Sub-libraries were then prepared from each pool using the same method described in Figure 1B, except that a pool-specific, barcoded adapter (Table S2) was used in the ligation step. These sub-libraries were combined into a single sample that can be sequenced with an Illumina Genome Analyzer II using just one lane of the instrument’s 8-lane flow cell. Reads were first mapped to the reference B. thetaiotaomicron genome to determine insertion sites; to assign an insertion site to a specific archived strain, the pool-specific barcodes associated with a given insertion location on the chromosome were then matched with the patterns assigned to the strains in the original archived set of plates.Using this strategy, we were able to identify the insertion coordinates for over 7000 individually archived B. thetaiotaomicron transposon mutant strains in parallel (Table S3). To verify the accuracy of these assignments, we first used ELISA to test strains predicted to have lost reactivity to two monoclonal antibodies of known specificity (Peterson et al., 2007). We also amplified transposon-genome junctions of test strains by semi-random PCR and sequenced the amplicons. In total, 179 of 183 strains tested (98%) produced the anticipated results (Figure 2C), confirming that combinatorial barcoding and INSeq can efficiently and economically generate archived, sequence-defined, mutant collections.To identify genes that contribute to exponential growth in nutrient-rich conditions in vitro, we maintained a 35,000-strain mutant population in this growth phase (OD600 0.1–0.4), under anaerobic conditions, in chemostats that were continuously supplied with fresh TYG medium. Output populations were sampled from four independent chemostats; two after ~15h of continuous exponential growth and two after ~45h of growth. DNA was prepared from each of these populations and transposon-adjacent genomic fragments were identified by INSeq. After removing insertions in the 3′ 10% of each gene, a z-test was applied to identify genes that show a significantly altered representation from the overall distribution of output:input abundance ratios after q-value correction for multiple hypothesis testing (q<0.05; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To test this approach for identifying fitness determinants, we also examined insertions in intergenic ‘neutral loci’ (Figure S6A). None of these 80 control regions passed the statistical cutoff for underrepresentation (3 increased in abundance). In contrast, 477 genes (~14% of the genes represented in the input population) showed a statistically significant change in abundance after in vitro selection (265 underrepresented/212 overrepresented; Figure S6B and Table S4). Consistent with selection for maximal growth rate in rich medium, the list of factors important for fitness under these conditions was significantly enriched in genes annotated as being in COG category C (energy production and conversion).As a proof-of-principle, we asked whether an observed enrichment in a broad functional group (COG category), represented among genes required for fitness, could be altered by manipulating environmental conditions. To do so, we harvested exponentially growing cells from mutant populations grown in minimal defined medium in the presence or absence of exogenous amino acids and quantified the abundance of transposon mutants by INSeq (n=4 replicate populations, each assayed independently). Gratifyingly, the set of genes required for fitness specifically in the amino acid-deplete condition was most highly enriched (p<0.0005) in COG category E (amino acid transport/metabolism) (Figure S7 and Table S5).To survey the B. thetaiotaomicron genome for genes critical for fitness in a mammalian gut ecosystem, we colonized germ-free mice with a single gavage of approximately 108 colony-forming units (CFU) of the 35,000-strain mutant population (n = 15 animals representing 3 independent experiments, each involving a cohort of five 8–12 week old C57BL/6J males; experiments were performed ~3 months apart). The five animals in each cohort were caged individually, in a shared gnotobiotic isolator, and fed a standard, autoclaved, polysaccharide-rich, low fat chow diet ad libitum. The relative abundance of each mutant strain in the cecal bacterial population was defined at the time of sacrifice 14d after gavage; this interval between gavage and sacrifice encompassed several cycles of turnover of the mucus layer and the underlying gut epithelium, and is sufficient to allow mobilization of innate and adaptive immune responses (Peterson et al., 2007).All recipients of the gavage harbored equivalent levels of B. thetaiotaomicron at the time of sacrifice (~1011–1012 CFU/mL cecal contents as quantified by plating and by qPCR). Moreover, the relative representation of mutants was consistent between the ceca of individual mice (Tables S9–S11), and for most genes reflected their abundance in the input population (Figure 3A). However, compared to the input population, mutants in 370 genes showed significantly (q<0.05) altered representation (90 overrepresented/280 underrepresented) in all three cohorts of mice (Table S6; note that the largest category of genes identified in this screen encode hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins). Only one of the 80 ‘neutral intergenic’ controls described above was significantly underrepresented in these populations (two were overrepresented).(A) The transposon mutant population is largely stable in vivo. The relative abundance of mutations in each gene (points) was compared between input and output (median from wild-type monoassociated mice, n = 15) populations. Genes that show a statistically significant change (q<0.05) in representation in all three cohorts of mice are shown in red, others in gray. The relative abundances of 80 gene-sized ‘neutral loci’ are shown in black (no significant change) and green (three ‘neutral loci’ that pass the significance criteria). (B) Individual strains retrieved from the archived collection demonstrate that genes critical for fitness in vivo are dispensable in vitro. Each strain was cultured individually in TYG medium and doubling time was calculated from OD600 measurements. Mutants predicted by INSeq to have in vitro growth defects are marked with arrows. N/D, no growth detected. rnf, Na+-transporting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (BT0616-22); S-layer, putative S-layer locus (BT1953-7); nqr, Na+-translocating NADH-quinone reductase (BT1155-60); hly, hemolysin A (BT3459). (C) Insertions in the CPS4 locus (BT1338-58) show a consistent in vivo fitness defect. Individual insertion locations (open arrowheads) in a representative gene (BT1346; green arrow) are shown at top. Read counts for input (black) and output (orange) samples at each insertion location are indicated (output counts represent the median from the ceca of wild-type monoassociated mice, n = 15). Median output:input ratios for each gene (black/green arrows) across the CPS4 locus are shown below. Asterisks indicate the average FDR-corrected p-value (q) across 3 experimental cohorts (n = 5 mice/cohort): *q< 0.05; **q< 0.01.While the smaller group of 90 genes that produce a competitive advantage in the cecum when mutated (highlighted in Table S6 in blue and green) are not significantly enriched in any broad predicted functional (COG) categories, only half can be explained by corresponding behavior in chemostats containing rich medium. The underrepresented genes show a similar trend: half (146) of the 280 genes critical for in vivo fitness can be predicted from growth defects in rich medium; the remainder (134/280), which are highlighted in Table S6 in yellow, do not show a defect after prolonged exponential growth in vitro. These include loci with diverse predicted functions, including assembly of polysaccharide- and protein- based surface structures (BT1339-55, BT1953-7), synthesis and utilization of vitamin B12-dependent cofactors (BT2090-1, BT2760), and an rnf-like oxidoreductase complex (BT0616-22) (e.g. Figure S8).To confirm that the requirement for these genes in vivo could not be explained by general growth defects, we analyzed individual mutant strains retrieved from the archived strain collection. This collection contained sequence-defined, single-insertion transposon mutants in ~70% of the genes designated as critical for survival in the distal gut in vivo (~80% if predicted polar effects are included) (Table S3). After validating the site of selected transposon insertions by semi-random PCR and Sanger sequencing, we determined the exponential doubling time of representative strains individually (Figure 3B). Strains carrying transposon insertions in genes uniquely required in vivo had an in vitro growth rate similar to wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron, further suggesting that the critical function of these genes in vivo cannot be simply explained by a necessity for sustaining exponential growth in rich medium. In contrast, mutants that exhibited a competitive defect in the 35,000-strain population both in vitro and in vivo had a slower doubling time when cultured individually, suggesting that these genes play a basic role in bacterial cell physiology.An earlier report from our group used a targeted mutagenesis strategy to disable expression of genes encoding capsular polysaccharide (CPS) 4 in this organism; this strain was rapidly displaced by wild-type B. thetaiotaomicron after initial inoculation as a 1:1 mixture into germ-free mice (Peterson et al., 2007). The 35,000-strain transposon mutant population recapitulated this observation (Figures 3C and S9). The transposon mutant population included over 1100 independent insertions across 143 genes that span all eight CPS loci encoded in the B. thetaiotaomicron genome. None of the other CPS loci were required for fitness in vivo, indicating that CPS4 plays a unique role for B. thetaiotaomicron in the gut environment of mono-associated gnotobiotic mice fed a standard plant polysaccharide-rich chow diet. Moreover, our observation that transposon inactivation of genes in any single PUL did not confer a competitive disadvantage in vivo is consistent with B. thetaiotaomicron’s capacity for adaptive foraging of a broad range of glycans present in this diet (a total of 5137 distinct transposon mutants, involving 810 genes in all 88 polysaccharide utilization loci).We next asked whether a broad view of the mutant population as a whole could help address some basic questions in mammalian gut microbial ecology described in the Introduction: are the genetic determinants of fitness influenced by the bacterial community (microbiota) context; do inter- and intra-specific competition play distinct roles in shaping the selective pressures on a genome; is this selection primarily maintained by elements of the host immune system?To explore these questions, we manipulated two features of the host habitat: (i) the immune system, by introducing the B. thetaiotaomicron mutant population into germ-free mice with genetically engineered defects in innate or adaptive immunity (Myd88−/− and Rag1−/− respectively) or (ii) microbial composition, by including this mutant population as one component of three different types of defined communities: one consisting of 6 other sequenced human gut-associated Bacteroidetes, another composed of 8 sequenced human gut-associated Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and a third consisting of all 14 of these representatives of the human distal gut microbiota (n = 4–5 animals per treatment group; Figure 4A and Table S7). Animals were sacrificed 14d after gavage and their cecal contents harvested. qPCR assays of cecal DNA, using species-specific primers, revealed that gavage with a given multi-species input community yielded consistent cecal ‘output’ community compositional profiles (Figure 4B and Table S8).(A) Shifts in the population structure of the ~35,000-strain B. thetaiotaomicron mutant population reflect alterations in the selective pressures on its genome. The relative abundance of each mutant in the B. thetaiotaomicron population was evaluated in multiple host genotypes (wild-type C57Bl/6; Rag1−/−; Myd88−/−) and microbial contexts. (B) qPCR assays of cecal microbial community composition in gnotobiotic mice at the time of sacrifice. The ~35,000-strain B. thetaiotamicron population is indicated with arrows.Each of these treatments shifted the B. thetaiotaomicron population from its input distribution (Tables S9–S12). To search for functional trends in these shifts, we assigned the genes underrepresented in output populations to functional (COG) categories. The in vivo fitness determinants were significantly enriched in different predicted functions compared to essential genes, or to the genes required for maximal exponential growth in rich medium in vitro (Figure 5). For example, the predicted essential genes are most prominently enriched in COG categories J (translation, ribosome structure/biogenesis) and D (cell cycle control and cell division), neither of which is enriched among the in vivo fitness determinants. Instead, the genes required in vivo are biased towards energy production/conversion (category C), and amino acid and nucleotide transport/metabolism (COG categories E and F, respectively). This represents an expansion beyond the single category (C) enriched after selection for maximal growth rate in vitro and is consistent across all in vivo treatment groups.Percent representation was calculated as (number of genes in a COG category/number of genes underrepresented in output population). Significant enrichments in specific COG categories, assessed by comparing these percentages to a null expectation based on the size of the gene list and the representation of a given category in the genome, are marked with asterisks (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p<0.05).Closer examination of enriched COGs and carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) families highlight the role of polysaccharide synthesis for competitive fitness in this environment; overrepresented functions include UDP-glucose-4-epimerases and glycosyltransferases [specifically, GT2 and GT4 families (Cantarel et al., 2009)] (Table S13). Together, these observations suggest that at the level of statistical enrichment of broad functional groups, the in vivo fitness requirements were distinct from those derived in vitro, but that these enrichments were consistent across in vivo treatment conditions. Many of the annotated fitness determinants (e.g. CPS4 and the rnf-like oxidoreductase) followed this pattern: dispensable in vitro but critical across all in vivo conditions tested.This functional category enrichment analysis depends critically on genome annotation (~50% of genes were not assignable to COG categories), while not accounting for differences in selection magnitude between treatments. To circumvent these limitations, we used unsupervised hierarchical clustering to evaluate the relationships between all in vitro and in vivo output populations (48 samples in total). In this analysis, samples are clustered based on the relative abundance of mutants in each gene independent of annotation. A dendrogram of the clustering results separates the in vitro populations from those shaped by in vivo selection (Figure 6A). The populations recovered from monoassociated wild-type, Rag1−/− and Myd88−/− mice formed shared branches on this tree of mutant population structures, suggesting that B. thetaiotaomicron may have multiple, redundant pathways for countering immune pressures, at least under the conditions of these experiments. In contrast, the transposon mutant populations recovered from mice that also harbored other Bacteroidetes species were fully separable from the population structures selected in B. thetaiotaomicron monoassociations or those resulting from the presence of a Firmicutes+Actinobacteria consortium. These patterns were recovered in >99% of bootstrapped dendrograms, and also by unsupervised hierarchical clustering of samples based only on the genes that showed a significantly altered output:input ratio by z-test (data not shown).(A) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of B. thetaiotaomicron mutant population structures in vitro and in vivo. Branches are colored by treatment. Pie charts indicate the microbial context of the mutant population in samples from different branches of the tree. Bootstrap support is indicated by a square at each node: >50% (white), >90% (yellow), >99% (black/unmarked). (B) Principal coordinates analysis based on the representation of transposon-disrupted genes.To further evaluate the robustness of the clustering algorithm, we conducted a principal coordinates analysis on these 48 transposon mutant populations (Figures 6B and S10). Similar to the hierarchical clustering dendrograms, the first principal coordinate separates in vitro from in vivo mutant populations. The second coordinate separates these populations by microbial context: Bacteroidetes-containing communities shape a B. thetaiotaomicron mutant population that is distinct from that produced in monoassociations, or in the Firmicutes+Actinobacteria consortia, further indicating that although the same broad functional categories are enriched among B. thetaiotaomicron fitness determinants under a range of in vivo conditions, these mutant populations are additionally shaped by changes in microbial community composition.We applied a random forest classifier (Breiman, 2001) to identify genes that were responsible for the observed separation of mutant populations in monoassociated mice from those mutant populations present in Bacteroidetes co-colonized mice. This machine-learning algorithm serves to estimate the importance of predictor variables (i.e. genes) for differentiating between classes (i.e. the monoassociation versus Bacteroidetes co-colonized groups, which were distinguished by unsupervised clustering and principal coordinates analysis). This approach identified a total of 220 genes as important for differentiating these groups (Table S14). Mutants in 144 of these predictor genes had lower output:input ratios in the monoassociations: in other words, these genes were more important when other Bacteroidetes were not present. Mutants in 76 genes had lower output:input ratios in mice co-colonized with other Bacteroidetes. These 76 genes, which provide a signature of functions under increased selection for B. thetaiotaomicron in the presence of other Bacteroidetes, are enriched for components of amino acid biosynthetic pathways, suggesting that although these functions are required in all in vivo conditions, other Bacteroidetes may outcompete B. thetaiotaomicron for exogenous amino acids.165 independent transposon insertions, mapping to five adjacent genes (BT1957-53), conferred a drastic fitness disadvantage during monoassociation of germ-free mice, yet had no impact on exponential growth in vitro. Moreover, their effect on fitness was influenced by community context: the Bacteroidetes-only community exacerbated the competitive defect while the Firmicutes+Actinobacteria consortia fully nullified the requirement for these genes. Introducing all 14 of these species resulted in an intermediate phenotype (Figure 7A, B).(A) Genetic organization and predicted annotation of the BT1957-49 locus. (B) The relative abundance of transposon insertion mutants in input and output mutant populations is dependent on community context. Asterisks indicate FDR-corrected p-value (q) for each cohort: *q< 0.05; **q< 0.01. Few insertions/reads were identified for BT1952-49; fitness defects were similar in wildtype, Rag1−/−, and Myd88−/− monoassociated animals (data not shown). (C) BT1956 gene expression is regulated by vitamin B12. Error bars represent one standard deviation based on triplicate qRT-PCR experiments. Similar results were observed for BT1954 (data not shown). Interestingly, BT1956 insertion mutants do not exhibit growth defects in medium containing either 37 nM or 0.37 nM B12, suggesting that multiple loci are involved in acquisition of this vitamin in vitro (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, other loci annotated as being potentially involved in B12 uptake were coordinately upregulated with BT1957-49 in the genome-wide transcriptional profiling experiments discussed above. (D) Pie charts showing that the defined microbial communities characterized in this study vary in their capacity for vitamin B12 biosynthesis. Color codes: dark blue, species with a predicted complete biosynthetic pathway (see Tables S16 and S17 for annotations) that are able to grow in defined medium lacking B12 (‘demonstrated prototrophs’); light blue, organisms with a predicted complete biosynthetic pathway able to grow on rich medium but not on defined medium with or without B12 (‘predicted prototrophs’); dark green, species without a complete pathway whose growth in defined medium requires B12 (‘demonstrated auxotrophs’); light green, species without a complete biosynthetic pathway unable to grow on defined medium with or without B12 (‘predicted auxotrophs’); black, species that do not grow on defined medium with or without B12 but that possess a B12-independent methionine synthase (the presence of such an enzyme implies the absence of a B12 requirement). The relative proportions of prototrophs and auxotrophs shown represent the average in each community in vivo as determined by species-specific qPCR of cecal contents. (E) The B. thetaiotaomicron fitness requirement for BT1957-3 correlates with levels of the B12-prototrophic species Ruminococcus obeum in the microbial community. Each point represents an individual mouse containing a defined multi-species microbiota in addition to the B. thetaiotaomicron transposon mutant population. Color code: blue, Firmicutes+Actinobacteria community; pink, Bacteroidetes+Firmicutes+Actinobacteria. The relative abundance of R. obeum (determined by qPCR analysis of cecal contents at the time of sacrifice) is plotted against the average output:input ratio of B. thetaiotaomicron transposon mutants in genes BT1957-3 in each individual.Examination of B. thetaiotaomicron transcriptional profiles (NCBI GEO archive) disclosed that expression of genes in this locus (spanning BT1957-BT1949) is strongly upregulated in vivo compared to growth in vitro under a variety of conditions. Moreover, in two closely matched experiments conducted in defined minimal medium that differed in five components, expression was modulated >10-fold (Table S15). This observation was validated by qRT-PCR assays of BT1954 and BT1956 (data not shown). Systematic addition of each variable component revealed that locus transcription is induced in response to reduced levels of vitamin B12 (Figure 7C). Moreover, the ABC transporter encoded by BT1952-50 shares homology with the BtuFCD B12 acquisition system of S. typhimurium LT2 (23%, 35%, and 25% identity, respectively).Vitamin B12 is critically involved in normal mammalian physiology, yet is synthesized exclusively by microbes (Krautler, 2005). Because the complete genome sequence of each member of the defined microbial communities used in our experiments was known, we were able to use BLAST to identify homologs to known B12 synthesis, transport, or utilization genes in the synthetic human gut microbiomes (Tables S16 and S17). As described for the related species Porphorymonas gingivalis (Roper et al., 2000), members of the Bacteroidetes community were missing some or all of the genes necessary for synthesis of B12 or its direct precursors, but encoded predicted transporters and likely have an obligate B12 requirement for growth. In contrast, the Firmicute/Actinobacteria group contained several members that harbored complete B12 biosynthetic pathways. To test these predictions, we attempted to culture each species on defined medium in the presence and absence of vitamin B12. R. obeum, a Firmicute predicted to require this vitamin for methionine synthesis, grew robustly without B12 in the medium, while the Bacteroidetes were auxotrophic (Table S16). These observations suggest that the capacity for vitamin B12 biosynthesis is determined by community structure (Figure 7D) and that B. thetaiotaomicron responds to changes in community membership via the gene products encoded by BT1957-49. Consistent with this observation, the fitness defect of BT1957-3 mutants correlated well with variation in R. obeum levels between mice in vivo (R2 of log-transformed values = 0.77; Figure 7E).By simultaneously profiling the relative abundance of tens of thousands of B. thetaiotaomicron mutants across multiple conditions, we identified hundreds of genes that are critical for the fitness of this prominent human gut symbiont in vivo. A large number of these genes are not determinants of exponential growth in nutrient-replete medium in vitro.This approach (insertion sequencing, or INSeq) for functional genome-wide analysis of organisms for which a genome sequence (and possibly little else) is known, is generally applicable and extends existing techniques in several important ways. First, a single transposon replaces the sets of individually barcoded variants needed for signature-tagged mutagenesis (Hensel et al., 1995). Second, high-throughput sequencing provides a general alternative to the species-specific DNA microarrays required for hybridization-based mutant profiling (Mazurkiewicz et al., 2006). Third, this sequencing-based strategy identifies the precise genomic location and provides a ‘digital’ count-based abundance readout of individual insertions in both coding and noncoding regions. In this way, independent insertions with shared behavior serve to validate gene-level fitness effects. Finally, because mariner family transposon activity has been demonstrated in Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, this method is generalizable. Further, the barcoded pooling strategy used to create a sequence-defined archived strain collection allows for retrieval of individual strains of interest for follow-up studies of the impact of individual gene disruptions on various microbial functions and adaptation. In this way, a forward genetic tool (a mutagenized cell population that can be screened for phenotypes en masse) can also serve as a platform for reverse genetics (a collection of isogenic, sequence-defined mutations in most of the coding potential of the target genome).Surprisingly, mice lacking major branches of the immune system did not exhibit noticeably restructured B. thetaiotaomicron mutant populations compared to wildtype animals. It is possible that examination of microbial populations in closer contact with the host mucosa, or populations from host animals exposed to intentional immune stimulation, would aid the identification of genes differentially required for fitness in response to host immune surveillance. INSeq already can be applied to relatively small amounts of starting material: further decreases should help address the largely unexplored question of the relationship between the activities of the innate and/or adaptive immune systems and the biogeography of the microbiota.Our study underscores how selection is shaped by microbial context. Because the INSeq strategy specifically targets transposon-adjacent chromosomal fragments, it is possible to monitor changes in the structure of a mutagenized population (in either wild-type or genetically manipulated gnotobiotic mice) even if this population constitutes a small fraction of a larger microbial community. For example, using unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal coordinates analysis to evaluate the relationships between B. thetaiotaomicron mutant population structures in defined microbial communities in vivo, we observed that the presence of other Bacteroides was an important determinant of the selective pressures acting on the B. thetaiotaomicron genome. Additionally, we identified a mechanism by which B. thetaiotaomicron senses and responds to changes in gut microbial community structure: this species employs the products of BT1957-49 in response to variations in vitamin B12 levels that result from changes in community composition. These genes are dispensable in rich medium in vitro and become increasingly critical for fitness in vivo as the levels of B12 prototrophic species (such as R. obeum) are reduced. The mechanism by which R. obeum relieves this selective pressure, the role of the surface (S-layer) proteins encoded by this locus, and the consequences of microbial B12 competition on host physiology await further study.In principle, INSeq can be extended to an analysis of communities of defined species composition introduced into gnotobiotic mice together with, before, or after, introduction of one or more transposon-mutagenized species. Subsequent INSeq-based time series studies of these deliberately constructed microbial populations offer the opportunity to address a wide range of unanswered questions about properties of our gut microbiota, ranging from the characteristics, determinants, and ecologic principles underlying its initial assembly, to the genomic correlates of niche partitioning among its members, to the genetic and metabolic factors that determine the persistence and impact of various probiotic and enteropathogen species (and degree to which the functions required for persistence of gut mutualists overlap with those of pathogens (Hendrixson and DiRita, 2004; Lalioui et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2008; Shea et al., 2000)].In summary, INSeq can be applied to a variety of phylotypes to identify factors that shape their adaptations to myriad environments, and further, to readily retrieve mutants in the genes encoding such factors. As such INSeq, and the rapidly evolving capacity for massively parallel DNA sequencing that supports its application, should be a useful platform for microbial genetics, genomics and ecology.Escherichia coli S-17 λ pir strains (Cowles et al., 2000) were grown at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with carbenicillin 50 μg mL−1 where indicated. B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 (ATCC 29148) was grown anaerobically at 37°C in liquid TYG medium (Holdeman, 1977), or on brain-heart-infusion (BHI; Beckton Dickinson) agar supplemented with 10% horse blood (Colorado Serum Co.). Antibiotics (gentamicin 200 μg mL−1 and/or erythromycin 25 μg mL−1) were added as indicated. Other human gut-derived species were cultured in supplemented TYG(TYGs: see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).DNA purification, PCR, and restriction cloning were performed using standard methods.

PMC2896236,Functional states of homooligomers: insights from the evolution of glycosyltransferases,False,"Glycosylation is an important aspect of epigenetic regulation. Glycosyltransferase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycans, which glycosylates more than half of all proteins in eukaryotes and is involved in a wide range of biological processes. It has been suggested previously that homooligomerization in glycosyltransferases and other proteins might be crucial for their function. In this study, we explore functional homooligomeric states of glycosyltransferases in various organisms, trace their evolution and perform comparative analyses to find structural features which can mediate or disrupt the formation of different homooligomers. First we make a structure-based classification of the diverse superfamily of glycosyltransferases and confirm that the majority of the structures are indeed clustered into the GT-A or GT-B folds. We find that homooligomeric glycosyltransferases appear to be as ancient as monomeric glycosyltransferases and go back in evolution to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). Moreover, we show that interface residues have significant bias to be gapped out or unaligned in the monomers implying that they might represent features crucial for oligomer formation. Structural analysis of these features reveals that the vast majority of them represent loops, terminal regions and helices indicating that these secondary structure elements mediate the formation of glycosyltransferases' homooligomers and directly contribute to the specific binding. We also observe relatively short protein regions which disrupt the homodimer interactions although such cases are rare. These results suggest that relatively small structural changes in the non-conserved regions may contribute to the formation of different functional oligomeric states and might be important in regulation of enzyme activity through homooligomerization.Post-translational modifications play an important role in regulating protein function and glycosylation is one of the most complex forms of post-translational modifications making a large contribution to phenotypic diversity. It has been established that more than 50% of proteins in eukaryotes are glycosylated1 and glycans are involved in a wide range of biological processes, such as immune response, cell–cell interaction, cellular regulation, tumor growth, and cell invasion.2-7 Glycosyltransferase (GT) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of glycans, which sequentially transfers a monosaccharide unit from a nucleotide sugar donor to acceptor substrates including protein residues. Understanding the function and evolution of glycosyltransferases is crucial in providing the insights into the relationships between glycan diversification, protein glycosylation and the phenotype – the main area of research in glycomics. It has been shown that knockouts of some glycosyltransferases may result in cellular dysfunction and even death.8 Moreover, in bacteria, the majority of GTs are involved in the synthesis of glycolipids, peptidoglycans, and lipopolysaccharides and can be suitable targets for drug development against bacterial pathogens. Much effort has been devoted to the identification of genes encoding glycosyltransferases and the characterization of the structures and functions of these enzymes.9,10 Currently, there are more than 100 glycosyltransferase genes found in humans and according to the CAZy database glycosyltransferases consist of approximately 90 very diverse families,11 and account for 1-2% of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes (the number of genes is correlated with the number of coding genes).12Many soluble and membrane-bound proteins form homooligomeric complexes in a cell, in fact majority of all proteins from Protein Data Bank are homooligomers. The activity of many proteins such as enzymes, ion channel proteins, receptors, and transcription factors are regulated through homooligomerization. Indeed, it has been suggested that large assemblies consisting of many identical subunits have advantageous regulatory properties as they can undergo sensitive phase transitions.13 Moreover, oligomerization can also provide sites for allosteric regulation, generate new binding sites at dimer interfaces, increase affinity through multivalent binding and enhance the diversity in the formation of regulatory complexes. The regulation of protein activity through the transitions between different oligomeric states has been experimentally demonstrated on several systems.14-17 Phosphorylation of a residue on a dimer interface or interaction with different ligands may destabilize the oligomeric structure and might shift the reaction equilibrium which might be important in regulation of apoptosis and tumor formation. In the case of low affinity interactions between proteins and glycans, it has been shown that they can be compensated through the multivalent interactions realized through homooligomerization.2 In our recent work we showed, for example, that homooligomeric interfaces in proteins from the galectin family are very well conserved among a diverse spectrum of species.18 Such homooligomeric structures allow for precise positioning of glycoligands on galectins and increases their binding affinity.Several glycosyltransferases are similarly proven to form functional homooligomers, which play important roles in controlling enzyme activity and Golgi localization.19,20 For example, α2,6-sialyltransferase and GM2 synthase form very stable functional homodimers by disulfide bonds,21,22 In addition, a recent study indicated that glycosyltransferases may catalyze consecutive steps on the glycan biosynthesis pathways by interacting with each other and forming larger complexes.23 Indeed, there are some glycosyltransferases functioning as homooligomers while others function as monomers even though they can belong to the same protein fold class. In this paper we explore functional oligomeric states of these enzymes in various organisms and study their evolution. We also perform comparative analyses to find structural features which can mediate or disrupt the formation of biological homooligomers in glycosyltransferases. Detecting such features will help to understand the nature of regulation of enzyme activity through homooligomerization and sets the stage for prediction of functionally important oligomeric states for glycosyltransferases and other proteins.We obtained 68 non-redundant glycosyltransferase structures of 31 families from the CAZy database. Then we calculated the gapped structural alignment score (GSAS)24 and loop Hausdorff metric (LHM)25 as measures of structural similarity for clustering members of the GT-A and GT-B folds (Figure S1, see Methods). First we confirmed that the majority of the structures were correctly clustered into the GT-A or GT-B folds. Only three families GT42 (sialyltransferase), GT51 (peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases), and GT66 (oligosaccharyltransferase), had no significant similarity to any other families and were excluded from the analysis. We generated another score matrix to assess similarities among members of the GT-B fold at the domain level (Figure S2). The score matrix heat map representation shows similarities in the same domain as well as the similarities between the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains. There are some structures with very low similarity to others, such as GT44 (Toxin B) in GT-A and GT23 (fucosyltransferases) in the GT-B fold. It is not a trivial task to classify members of the extremely diverse GT superfamily but despite low similarity between the members of these folds (12% and 11% average sequence identity for GT-A and GT-B folds respectively) these structures still share the core elements as described below.Previous studies have pointed out the structural similarities in the diverse glycosyltransferase families.26,27 Here we defined structurally conserved core elements by using explicit structure-structure alignments and deliberately chosen structural similarity metrics. The core structure of the GT-A fold consists of a seven-stranded beta-sheet, flanked by six helices, and a two-stranded beta-sheet (Figure S3). The D×D motif, often interacting with the divalent cation, lies at the junction of the two beta-sheets. The structure of the N-terminal half of the core, including the first five strands, three helices, and the D×D motif, is more conserved than the C-terminal half of the core, in which insertions of secondary structures are frequently observed.GT-B fold enzymes are composed of two domains that are similar to each other. The core structure of the N-terminal domain consists of a seven-stranded beta-sheet, flanked by six helices (Figure. S3). This domain is involved in acceptor sugar molecule binding and is more variable consistent with the diversity of acceptor molecules. The core structure of the C-terminal domain consists of a six stranded beta-sheet, flanked by five helices, and the consecutive three helices at the C-terminal end. This domain involves the donor molecule binding (usually nucleotide-diphospho-sugar) and is more conserved consistent with the conserved nature of the substrates. An additional strand is observed only in the GT72 family, indicating the C-terminal domain is more conserved than the N-terminal domain at the secondary structure level.Figure 1 presents the structural similarity dendrogram trees for the GT-A and GT-B folds which should reflect the major course of evolution of glycosyltransferases. They were constructed based on the GSAS similarity matrix (trees constructed based on the loop similarity metric can be found in Figure S4). As can be seen from these figures, in the vast majority of the cases the members from the same CAZy family are clustered together with the exception of the poorly conserved GT4 family. Glycosyltransferase families can be classified into two groups based on the mechanism of their glycosylation reactions: retaining and inverting. For the former the stereochemistry of the anomeric carbon is retained between the donor substrate and the product, for the latter it is inverted between them. The trees show that enzymes with retaining and inverting of the anomer correspond very well to two phylogenetic groups on the tree (with the exceptions of the GT27 families of the GT-A fold and the GT70, GT63 and GT10 families with the GT-B fold). This indicates that two types of glycosyltransferase reaction mechanisms diverged quite early in the evolution of the GT-A and GT-B folds and go back in evolution to the last universal common ancestor.The model phylogenetic tree for the GT-A (a) and GT-B (b) folds. Nodes are labeled with a family identifier, a PDB code, and an organism name. Branches are colored depending on their reaction mechanisms (red – inverting and blue – retaining). Homooligomeric and monomeric states are indicated by black and open circles respectively, and ancestral oligomeric states inferred by parsimony are shown by squares. External nodes with the same color indicate conserved binding. The asterisk corresponds to the exceptional case 2Z86, which contains two domains in the single chain in the GT-A fold.We identified and verified homooligomeric states (monomers, dimers, tetramers, and octamers) for all family members that are classified into the GT-A or GT-B folds using PISA algorithm (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies) and additionally confirmed with IBIS (Inferred Biomolecular Interactions Server) algorithm.28 We mapped oligomeric states and their binding modes on the external nodes of the model phylogenetic trees for folds A and B and inferred ancestral states using maximum parsimony (see Methods). Several observations are evident from these trees. First, the higher order homooligomeric states (dimers, tetramers, and octamers) appear to be as ancient as the monomeric state for GT and go back in evolution to the last universal common ancestor. Indeed as can be seen from Figure S5 majority of glycosyltransferase families include all three major kingdoms of life (additional sequences without structures were purged from CAZy database to assign taxonomic diversity) and monomeric and oligomeric states existed before the family specifications. Moreover, there seem to be multiple gene duplications leading to a large number of paralogs with different GT specificities and homooligomeric states. There are three families in each fold which are consistently annotated as monomers (GT44, GT7, GT27 in GT-A and GT5, GT9 and GT80 in GT-B) while some families seem to function only as homodimers (GT81, GT43 in GT-A and GT35, GT23 in the GT-B fold, respectively). In addition, five families from both folds show mixed oligomeric states which suggests that their activity can be regulated through the transition between different oligomeric states. We also observed strikingly different binding arrangements in various homodimeric glycosyltransferases. There is only one homodimer binding mode from the GT35 family which is well-conserved in a number of very diverse species. Others are conserved among paralogs from the same species (example: binding modes from the GT43 and GT81 families) while the diverse families GT1 and GT4 can be characterized by multiple binding arrangements.There are some glycosyltransferases functioning as monomers while others function as homooligomers even though they can belong to the same fold class. This indicates that relatively small differences between structures may enable or disable some enzymes to form a homooligomer. We performed a comparative analysis of monomers and homooligomers to detect these structural differences. We first identified the interface residues of all homooligomers using the PISA algorithm, and then mapped these interfaces to the closest homologs in the monomeric state using structure-structure superpositions (the mapping of monomers to closest homooligomers produced similar results (Table S1). We call those regions “gapped” which are present in homooligomers and absent from the monomers (and vice versa) and “unaligned” those regions which include both gapped and misaligned residues (see Figure 2 for the illustration). We checked whether there is an association between the interaction interface and gapped/unaligned regions, and found that for the overall dataset the interface residues of the homooligomers correspond to both gapped and unaligned regions (Fisher exact test with Bonferroni's correction p-values ≪ 0.01). Table 1 shows a list of the individual homooligomers, their corresponding monomers, and p-values calculated for each case. In 22 out of 30 homooligomers (73%) the interface residues have a significant bias toward unaligned regions. In a smaller but significant fraction of cases (13 out of 30, 43%) the interface residues have a significant bias to be gapped out in the monomers implying that they might represent features crucial for oligomer formation. Interestingly, for the GT-B fold this tendency is more pronounced and 9 out of 16 oligomers (56%) have interface features which are absent from monomers. We found that the presence of oligomer mediating (or disabling) features in a protein does not depend on the level of sequence and structural similarity between monomer and oligomer. This together with the observation that these features are preferentially located on the oligomer-forming interfaces implies that they cannot be attributed merely to the structural differences occurring as a result of evolutionary divergence.Examples of unaligned and gapped regions. Lower-case characters on the sequence alignments, shown by green, represent unaligned or gapped residues.Statistical tests of independence between interface residues and unaligned or gapped residuesAn asterisk indicates statistical significance (p-value < 0.01) after Bonferroni correction, the “pound sign” # indicates those cases where the monomer contains disabling regions and the symbol ‡ corresponds to those cases where the homooligomer is confirmed by IBIS.Next we analyzed the structural and sequence characteristics of those unaligned/gapped peptides which affect the homooligomerization. We identified secondary structures for 1534 interface residues in 30 homooligomers. Gapped loops, terminal regions and helices account for approximately 33% of all interface residues and unaligned loops, terminal regions and helices account for 53% of all interface residues, whereas beta strands are in a minority (Figure S6). There is a statistically significant preference for gapped loops, terminal regions and helices to be present on interface regions in comparison with noninterface regions (p-values < 0.01, Table S2), this tendency is especially evident for the GT-B fold. This indicates that these secondary structure elements play an important role in the formation of glycosyltransferase homooligomers. We have also calculated the amino acid composition of unaligned interface regions compared to aligned core regions but did not find any significant amino acid bias (Figure S7).A typical example which illustrates how unaligned loops and helices can contribute to the formation of a homodimer is the glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT) from the GT43 family, which is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans. The C-terminal end of GlcAT, especially a long loop and the last helix, participates in the formation of a homodimer interface (marked by yellow in Figure 3a). Each subunit in a dimer possesses a substrate binding site near the interface, where a functionally important glutamine in one subunit interacts with a substrate of the other subunit.29 On the other hand, the C-terminal part (marked by yellow in Figure 3b) of SpsA protein, the closest monomer to the GlcAT dimer, is tied up by a disulfide bond (blue), cannot participate in any interactions and is located on the opposite side compared to the C-terminal region of the aligned dimer subunit.Structural comparison of homodimer glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT), 3CU0 (a) and a monomer SpsA,1H7Q (b). The C-terminus of 3CU0, shown by yellow, is located on the interface region, whereas the C-terminus of 1H7Q, also shown by yellow, is located on the opposite side.Another example is glycogen phosphorylase from the GT35 family, which is an allosterically regulated enzyme, involved in the glycogen metabolism. The oligomeric states of all six members of this family, including four eukaryotes and two bacteria, are homodimers which is confirmed by previous experiments.30,31 Figure 4 shows a sequence alignment based on the pairwise structural alignment of six glycogen phosphorylases and three glycogen glucosyltransferases in the GT5 family, which were found to be the closest monomers. There are several alpha helices and loops in the glycogen phosphorylases that do not exist in the GT5 enzymes. Moreover, the majority of these structural elements are located on the homooligomeric interfaces. In particular, a long N-terminal tail containing many interface residues is distinctive because usually glycosyltransferases have only a short transmembrane domain at the N-terminal end. Interestingly, this N-terminal region also includes a phosphorylation and ligand binding sites, such as ATP and glucose. It has been shown that conformational changes upon phosphorylation occur at the dimer interface, involve ordering of the flexible N-terminal region and affect the enzymatic activity.32,33The multiple alignment of the GT35 and GT5 family enzymes at the N-terminal region. The alignment was constructed by superimposing eight pairwise structure alignments between 3DDS and the other structures. Blue characters represent structurally aligned residues, and red characters correspond to interface residues. Gray cylinders and arrows indicate alpha-helices and beta-strands of the 3DDS structure.The functional and structural features mentioned above are examples of specific regions that exist only in dimeric forms whereas we also found specific protein regions which are present only in a monomeric form and might disrupt the oligomerization. We tried to detect those residues in a monomer that are absent from a dimer and that are located between residues aligned to the dimer interface. We found four such monomers, they are indicated by the pound sign in Table 1. One of them represents a case of two GT8 structures: one is glycogenin glucosyltransferase from a eukaryote (1LL2), and the other is galactosyltransferase from bacteria (1G9R), which catalyzes a key step in the biosynthesis of lipooligosaccharide structure. Our results show that the eukaryotic enzyme is a homodimer and the bacterial enzyme is a monomer. In glycogenin glucosyltransferase from a eukaryote the interface of the homodimer has a cleft, which allows the formation of a stable complex (Figure 5a), whereas in galactosyltransferase from bacteria the residues corresponding to the interface are covered by other residues, thereby filling the cleft (Figure 5b). The alignment of these two structures reveals that the residues that cover the interface region are two loops not present in the homodimer and located close to the interface region as judged from the monomer-dimer alignment (Figure 5c). This result indicates that these two inserted loops might disrupt the formation of a homodimer and the deletion of the two loops enables the formation of the homodimer.Structural comparison of homodimeric glycogenin glucosyltransferase, 1LL2 (a) and galactosyltransferase, 1G9R (b). Interface residues in 1LL2 and mapped interface residues in 1G9R are shown by yellow; and disabling loops are indicated by blue coloring. (c) The sequence alignment of the interface region is based on the structural superposition of 1LL2 and 1G9R.We analyzed the evolution, functional importance, and structural features which mediate or disable the formation of homooligomers in the glycosyltransferase family. Glycosyltransferases represent an extremely interesting and appropriate example to study these effects since this family is very ancient, encompassing all three kingdoms of life, showing a diversity of biological functions, substrates, binding selectivities, reaction mechanisms, and oligomeric states. The interactions between subunits as well as with other proteins are extremely important for the functionality of glycosyltransferases. Several roles of homooligomerization in the functionality of glycosyltransferases have been discussed previously. For example, binding affinity and selectivity might be regulated through oligomerization or namely through the bond formation between the substrate bound to one subunit in a dimer and the specific residues of another subunit.29 Oligomerization might also be required for stability and thermostability of some GTs (GT81 and GT78 families)34,35 while inter-subunit interactions in glycogenin dimers (GT8 family) are very important in self-glucosylation of glycogenin.36 At the same time glycogen phosphorylase from the GT35 family can undergo conformational changes upon phosphorylation at the dimer interface which involves ordering of the flexible N-terminal region 32 thus affecting and regulating the enzymatic activity.Our phylogenetic analysis of the glycosyltransferases points to the ancient origin of higher order homooligomeric states which appear to be as ancient as the monomeric state and goes back in evolution as early as the time of divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Moreover, the examination of the trees for both the GT-A and GT-B folds shows multiple gene duplications leading to a large number of paralogs with different specificities. Although many different glycosyltransferase families form biological dimers, the dimer binding modes are surprisingly diverse among different families implying that paralogs might acquire different binding arrangements throughout evolution. Our recent study on a larger dataset of families exhibiting multiple binding arrangements showed that binding modes are conserved among homologous proteins from the same family sharing 50-70% identity or higher 18. It implies that oligomeric state, binding mode, and features affecting oligomerization can be reliably inferred only from close homologs.As mentioned earlier, different oligomeric states may provide sites for allosteric regulation, generate new binding sites at dimer interfaces to increase specificity, increase affinity through multivalent binding, and provide the regulation through the transition between active and non-active forms which in turn depend on the protein oligomeric state. To understand such functional mechanisms and predict those features which might mediate/disrupt oligomerization and provide regulatory switches one might want to investigate the sequence and structural features which differentiate between different oligomeric states. In a recent landmark study this question was addressed on a set of fifty domain families.37 Manual inspection of these domains in monomeric and homooligomeric states revealed that for eleven domain families (22%) certain loop regions were responsible for enabling or disabling the oligomeric interfaces. In the current study we performed an automated analysis of different oligomeric forms from 31 families of two folds of glycosyltransferases and made several main observations. First, we have not observed any amino acid changes which would account for the difference between oligomeric states and even very remotely related glycosyltransferases with quite different amino acid usage on the homodimer interface regions have the same oligomeric state. We also have not observed examples of domain swapping which can be an important mechanism to form oligomeric proteins.38 Second, we found that there is a statistical bias for structurally unaligned and to a smaller degree for gapped regions (present in homooligomers, absent in the corresponding monomers) to occur on homodimer interfaces, which points to the importance of these regions in the formation of homooligomers. Finally, our further analysis showed that these unaligned/gapped interface regions for glycosyltransferases predominantly include loops and to a lesser extent alpha-helices. The observation that alpha-helices can affect the formation of specific homooligomeric interfaces is consistent with a recent study which showed that alpha-helices in some proteins from the p53 family might be essential for stabilizing p53 tetramers and can be lost in other species or acquire different functions.39 Although more flexible and variable than the core regions, loops are under strong evolutionary constraints to preserve their properties and might have pronounced functional significance for protein binding. It is evident from the correct GT classification provided by our loop similarity metric and consistent with the previous studies that loops might offer important clues to gauge remote evolutionary relatedness.25,40-42. Consistent with Akiva et al.37 we also show that loops play a crucial role in forming homooligomers and might regulate the binding affinity of homooligomeric interactions. Loops on interaction interfaces can be also used in a negative design strategy to protect proteins from non-specific aggregation.43 Consistent with the negative design strategy we also observed in some cases that inserted regions (with respect to the monomer) disrupt the homodimer interactions (so called “disabling” loops according to Akiva et al terminology) although such cases are rare compared to those regions which mediate the homooligomer formation. This points to the relative importance of enabling compared to disabling regions in the monomer-oligomer evolution of glycosyltransferases.First, we derived a list of glycosyltransferase structures from the CAZy database,11 which provides PDB codes of crystallographically determined glycosyltransferases. We then selected representative structures with the highest resolution in cases where the CAZy database lists multiple structures per a single protein. Structures of the GT-A fold with divalent metal ions were given priority since these ions are essential for their catalysis.10 The representative 73 non-redundant glycosyltransferase structures from 31 families are listed in Table S3. Additional information, such as function and reaction types of specific glycosyltransferases, was collected from CAZy, KEGG GLYCAN,44 and Conserved Domain Database (CDD).45Glycosyltransferases are classified into two different folds: the so-called GT-A and GT-B folds. The GT-A fold consists of one domain while the GT-B fold comprises two similar domains. The diversity between glycosyltransferases is very high. Structure superpositions should provide additional insights into their classification. To achieve this goal we use all pairwise structure-structure alignments between glycosyltransferase representative structures, which are pre-calculated and stored in the PubVAST database.46 We calculate the gapped structural alignment score (GSAS)24 and loop Hausdorff metric (LHM)25 as measures of structural similarity for clustering members of the GT-A and GT-B folds. GSAS together with the LHM scores were shown to perform very well in ranking structurally similar proteins with respect to their homology.47 The GSAS score is defined as following24 (see Supplementary material for the LHM score definition):Where Nmat is the number of aligned residues, Ngap is the number of gaps, and RMS is the root mean square deviation between the aligned pairs of α-carbon atoms. These two scores produced very similar cluster trees and therefore we will present only the tree obtained using the GSAS score (the LHM based tree is shown in Figure S4). We normalized the scores by dividing them by the maximum GSAS score among all pairwise alignments. To obtain more accurate alignments and similarity scores in the case of the GT-B fold, we separately aligned the N-terminal and C-terminal domains and calculated an average GSAS score over these two domains. If there were other domains present in the chains (SH3, TRP and others) we excluded them from the analysis. The domain boundaries were taken from the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB).48 The dendrograms were calculated from GSAS distance matrices using the neighbor-joining method49 from PHYLIP version 3.68.50 It should be mentioned that very recently a new classification of glycosyltransferases from both folds has been released in CDD, which overall agrees with our structural classification with the exception of some entries from the diverse GT4 and GT1 families which are not very well resolved on both the CDD tree and our tree.We annotated oligomeric states and interfaces of all the representative glycosyltransferases using the PISA algorithm (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies). PISA (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html) is based on chemical thermodynamics and estimates the stability of macromolecular assemblies in protein crystal structures 51. It should be mentioned that PISA can infer macromolecular assemblies and their interfaces using crystallographic symmetries even if such assemblies/interfaces are not present in the PDB asymmetric unit. To confirm the PISA results, we used IBIS (Inferred Biomolecular Interactions Server), a new server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/ibis/ibis.cgi), which reports interactions observed in experimentally determined protein structural complexes and infers conserved binding sites by inspecting protein complexes formed by close homologs.28 We then examined whether or not interfaces are conserved between homooligomers. Similarly to the conserved binding mode idea,52 if more than 50% of interface residues are structurally superimposed in different homooligomeric complexes, the interface is defined as a conserved binding mode.Oligomeric states were assigned to internal tree nodes using maximum parsimony. We implemented a modification of Fitch's algorithm,53 usually defined for a binary tree, to allow nodes to have any number of children. The first step of this algorithm applies the following rule recursively, starting from the leaves, to label every internal node: if a given oligomeric state (we distinguish here monomers and homooligomers) is present in more than, less than, or exactly half of labeled children, label the parent “present,” “absent,” or “unknown,” respectively. A second traversal of the tree from root to leaf removes unknown labels by assigning each node the same label as its parent. We break ties at balanced trees, i.e. trees with unknown root, by setting the root to “present”.We compared glycosyltransferases in monomeric and homooligomeric states to determine the regions which are structurally different between the monomers and the oligomers. Two types of such regions were considered: “unaligned” and “gapped” regions. Here “gapped region” refers to the set of residues that are present in the oligomer and absent from the monomer (or vice versa), whereas “unaligned region” includes both gapped residues and structurally unaligned residues (Figure 2). First, we selected the most similar structure between monomers and oligomers using the GSAS similarity score. We then detected unaligned and gapped residues between an oligomer and its closest monomer using their VAST structure-structure alignment.46 The Fisher exact test was applied to find whether unaligned/gapped residues have a tendency to be among the interface residues. For each oligomer, for example, we counted the number of unaligned/aligned residues on the interface/non-interface, and generated a 2 × 2 contingency table (Table S4). The one-sided P-values were calculated and adjusted for multiple-testing using Bonferroni's correction.We thank Yuri Wolf for careful reading of the manuscript.

PMC2903421,Dissecting the in Vivo Metabolic Potential of Two Human Gut Acetogens*,False,"Fermenting microbial communities generate hydrogen; its removal through the production of acetate, methane, or hydrogen sulfide modulates the efficiency of energy extraction from available nutrients in many ecosystems. We noted that pathway components for acetogenesis are more abundantly and consistently represented in the gut microbiomes of monozygotic twins and their mothers than components for methanogenesis or sulfate reduction and subsequently analyzed the metabolic potential of two sequenced human gut acetogens, Blautia hydrogenotrophica and Marvinbryantia formatexigens in vitro and in the intestines of gnotobiotic mice harboring a prominent saccharolytic bacterium. To do so, we developed a generally applicable method for multiplex sequencing of expressed microbial mRNAs (microbial RNA-Seq) and, together with mass spectrometry of metabolites, showed that these organisms have distinct patterns of substrate utilization. B. hydrogenotrophica targets aliphatic and aromatic amino acids. It increases the efficiency of fermentation by consuming reducing equivalents, thereby maintaining a high NAD+/NADH ratio and boosting acetate production. In contrast, M. formatexigens consumes oligosaccharides, does not impact the redox state of the gut, and boosts the yield of succinate. These findings have strategic implications for those who wish to manipulate the hydrogen economy of gut microbial communities in ways that modulate energy harvest.Mammals harbor large and diverse communities of gut microbes (1). One important function of the gut microbiota is to break down otherwise indigestible components of the diet, many of which are derived from plants (2). Fermentation of dietary polysaccharides and proteins is accomplished by syntrophic interactions between microbes linked in a metabolic food web that yields short chain fatty acids (e.g. acetate, propionate, and butyrate), other organic acids (e.g. formate), and gases (H2 and CO2) (3). In a primary fermenter, the accumulation of H2 inhibits reoxidation of NADH, thereby reducing the yield of ATP and short chain fatty acids, including acetate (4). Short chain fatty acids account for up to 10% of human energy requirements (5). Thus, changes in the microbiota that affect production of short chain fatty acids (i.e. fermentation efficiency) may also affect host energy balance.Three groups of gut microbes, methanogens, acetogens, and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB),3 have the capacity to consume H2. The end products of H2 oxidation generated by each of these groups (methane, acetate, and H2S, respectively) have diverse and important effects on host physiology and/or the environment (6,–9). Understanding the metabolic roles that methanogens, acetogens, and SRB play in the H2 economy of the gut has implications for understanding and potentially manipulating our energy balance.In considering the different groups of H2-consuming organisms as potential therapeutic targets for manipulating the efficiency of gut microbial fermentation and host energy balance, it is important to understand the range of niches encompassed by members of each group, the degree of niche overlap that exists within and between groups, and the various factors that govern the levels of colonization of these groups. For example, there is evidence that SRB may gain an advantage depending upon the levels of mucin (10) or sulfate (11) available and that acetogens may compete more effectively in the absence of methanogens (12). Attempts to replace methanogens with acetogens in ruminants, motivated by a desire to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and improve the efficiency of fuel partitioning between diet and host (13) have been generally unsuccessful (14). Nonetheless, experiments performed in gnotobiotic lambs have shown that hydrogen-dependent acetogenesis can sustain a functional rumen and replace methanogens as a sink for H2 (15).To successfully manipulate the human gut bioreactor, we need to understand its operations at a mechanistic level. Although deep draft and finished genome sequences are now available for over a hundred gut microbial species, including several H2 consumers, there is a lack of broadly applicable tools that enable microbiologists to go beyond descriptions of “what gene is present” in a genome or a community to understanding the mechanisms by which microbes gain access to and metabolize nutrients within their habitats and influence one another and their hosts (16).To begin to unravel the niches of these organisms, the substrates they use, and the factors that affect their metabolism, we have developed a method for massively parallel sequencing of expressed microbial mRNAs (microbial RNA-Seq) that utilizes gut microbe-directed rRNA depletion oligonucleotides and size selection to increase the fraction of mRNA in the total microbial RNA population by more than 10-fold. We validated the quantitative precision of this method and used simulations to determine the sequencing depth necessary to detect expression changes in bacterial communities where members are present at different abundances. To focus the application of this technique to understanding the niches (professions) of H2 consumers in the gut, we first analyzed human gut microbiome data sets, obtained by shotgun sequencing of fecal microbial community DNA samples obtained from six families of monozygotic twins and their mothers, and showed that pathway components for acetogenesis are more abundantly and consistently represented than components for methanogenesis or sulfate reduction. We then focused on characterizing the interactions between two recently sequenced human gut-derived acetogens and a prominent sequenced human gut saccharolytic bacterium, Bacteroides thetaiotoamicron, in the distal intestines of gnotobiotic mice. We employed microbial RNA-Seq to profile their transcriptomes in defined locations of the mouse intestine and subsequently verified our RNA-Seq-based predictions of the metabolic activities of these organisms in vivo by using mass spectrometric and biochemical analyses. In principle, this multi-faceted approach can be broadly applied to explore the niches and metabolic activities of members of myriad microbial communities.Genome assemblies for Blautia hydrogenotrophica strain DSM 10507 and Marvinbryantia formatexigens DSM 14469 were downloaded from GenBankTM (accession numbers {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NZ_ACBZ00000000"",""term_id"":""223987233""}}NZ_ACBZ00000000 and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NZ_ACCL00000000"",""term_id"":""241911894""}}NZ_ACCL00000000).Cecal and fecal samples obtained from mice at the time that they were sacrificed and bacteria cultured using the conditions described in the supplemental text were immediately frozen at −80 °C and maintained at this temperature prior to processing. All of the samples were treated with RNAProtect (Qiagen). An aliquot (∼100 mg) of each frozen cecal sample was suspended in a solution containing 500 μl of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich), 500 μl of extraction buffer A (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA), 210 μl of 20% SDS, and 500 μl of a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (125:24:1, pH 4.5; Ambion) and lysed by using a bead beater (BioSpec Products). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (8,000 × g; 3 min). The extraction was repeated, and the nucleic acids were precipitated with isopropanol and sodium acetate (pH 5.5). A similar protocol was used for fecal samples and for cell pellets obtained from in vitro cultures.Details about protocols used for removing residual DNA from RNA preparations, rRNA depletion, double-stranded cDNA synthesis, and multiplex sequencing with the Illumina GA-II instrument as well as our data analysis pipeline are provided in the supplemental text. The methods for analyzing fecal microbiome data sets for the presence of H2-consuming metabolic pathways, in vitro culture conditions, and quantitative biochemical and GC/MS assays of metabolites are also provided in the supplemental text.Known acetogens comprise a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria, distributed among 22 different genera belonging to three phyla (17). Most are members of the Firmicutes, which together with the Bacteroidetes constitute the dominant bacterial phyla in the distal human gut (18, 19). The reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (also known as the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway) enables some bacterial species to convert glucose stoichiometrically to acetate (homoacetogenesis) and/or to grow under conditions where CO2 and H2 are the sole sources of carbon and energy (20, 21). In this situation, acetogens use four molecules of H2 to reduce two molecules of CO2, generating ATP and acetate as the main end products of their metabolism (17). Acetogenesis from CO2 via the acetyl-CoA pathway accounts for ∼35% of the acetate produced from glucose in fecal suspensions from subjects that do not carry methanogens (22); acetate in the distal gut is readily absorbed and used in the liver as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis.Previous attempts at determining the abundance of acetogens in the human gut microbiota were based on growth on H2 and CO2, a trait that it is not conserved among all acetogens (12, 23). In addition, the polyphyletic nature of acetogens precludes the use of a culture-independent 16S rRNA gene-based approach to study them as a functional group (17). Co-occurrence of genes coding for acetyl-CoA synthase (acsB), carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (acsA), and both subunits of the corrinoid iron-sulfur protein (acsC-acsD) is a good marker for the presence of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway in bacteria (supplemental Fig. S1A) (24). Therefore, we searched the fecal microbiomes of 18 adult females living in the United States (19) for sequences bearing significant homology to each one of these four genes (six sets of adult monozygotic twins and their mothers; average of 100 Mb generated per fecal sample by 454 FLX shotgun pyrosequencing; see supplemental text for details). Sequences matching enzymes of the acetyl-CoA pathway were present in all samples (note that this method targets all acetogens, not just H2-consuming species).To compare the abundance of the acetyl-CoA pathway relative to other hydrogen consumers, we searched for sequences matching genes specific for methanogens (mcrA; encodes methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A, a conserved enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway) and sulfate reducers (dsrB; encodes dissimilatory sulfite reductase β-subunit). We detected mcrA in only 22% of the samples and dsrB in 66%. Even in samples where these two genes were present, sequences matching the acetyl-CoA pathway were ∼6–7-fold more abundant (p < 0.005, analysis of variance; supplemental Fig. S1B). These results indicate that (i) acetogenesis is a dominant and consistently represented metabolic process in the distal guts of the sampled individuals and (ii) the three different types of H2 consumers co-exist in at least a subset of these people.Despite their abundance in myriad ecosystems, only three known acetogens have been sequenced to date: Moorella thermoacetica, a soil-associated acetogen (24), and two human gut isolates (both Firmicutes), B. hydrogenotrophica (formerly known as Ruminococcus hydrogenotrophicus; strain S5a36; isolated from feces of a non-methane-excreting human subject (25)) and M. formatexigens (formerly known as Bryantella formatexigens; strain I-52T; does not grow with H2 and CO2 and requires formate for acetogenesis (26)). Deep draft assemblies of the genomes of these two organisms were generated by the Washington University Genome Center under the auspices of the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative. In silico analysis of the B. hydrogenotrophica genome disclosed that it possesses all of the genes involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (supplemental Table S1A and Fig. S1A), including eight genes predicted to encode subunits of iron-only hydrogenases (supplemental Table S1B). However, it has a limited capacity to access polysaccharides (30 glycoside hydrolases were identified using the classification scheme in the CAZy database (27) (supplemental Table S1C)). In contrast, the deep draft assembly of the M. formatexigens genome lacks a complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, i.e. it does not possess the selenium-containing subunit of formate dehydrogenase, thereby explaining the requirement of the organism for formate for acetogenesis, at least in vitro (26). Unlike B. hydrogenotrophica, M. formatexigens is richly endowed with glycoside hydrolases (103, which is more than most gut Firmicutes sequenced to date (supplemental Table S1D)).The task of identifying the metabolic niches of these newly sequenced gut acetogens posed a challenge that is pervasive throughout microbiology; the surge in genome sequencing has led to a massive increase in the number of species for which there are no available tools to move beyond descriptions of gene content to assessments of gene function. DNA microarrays currently represent one of the most commonly used tools for this purpose. However, their flexibility is limited: custom arrays may have to be fabricated for each species or strain being characterized. Moreover, problems of cross-hybridization potentially limit the number of community members that can be assayed simultaneously. RNA-Seq provides a more general approach to RNA quantitation that obviates some of the limitations of DNA microarrays. Although RNA-Seq has been successfully applied to several organisms (28, 29), additional problems hinder its applicability to microbial communities, including the need to enrich the mRNA portion of total RNA relative to the much larger pool of rRNA and the need to determine the depth of sequencing necessary to detect transcriptional changes in species present at different relative abundances.Therefore, we developed a method for microbial mRNA profiling that uses the massively parallel Illumina GA-II instrument and is broadly applicable to sequenced gut microbes. Bacterial mRNA lacks a poly(A) tail, which prevents specific targeting of the mRNA versus the much larger rRNA pool when generating cDNA for sequencing. Our approach combined multiple column washes to deplete 5S rRNA and tRNAs by size fractionation, with a hybridization-based pulldown of 16S and 23S rRNAs using custom-designed biotinylated oligonucleotides that contain short rDNA sequences conserved across a set of 37 human gut-derived sequenced microbial genomes (see supplemental text, “Optimization of RNA Depletion” for details). We achieved up to 13-fold enrichment of mRNA using this method (mRNA represented on average 51% of sequences present in 89 rRNA-depleted microbial RNA samples described below). The rRNA-depleted RNA preparations were then used for random hexanucleotide-primed production of double-stranded cDNA and subsequent sequencing. Read lengths of 36 nucleotides were more than sufficient to accurately assign a transcript (cDNA) to a given locus in the genomes of the sequenced members of a model two-member human gut microbiota, assembled in gnotobiotic mice, composed of a saccharolytic bacterium and one or the other sequenced acetogen (see below and supplemental text). The degree of rRNA depletion achieved allowed us to pool up to 10 double-stranded cDNA samples, each labeled with a unique 4-bp barcode, per lane of the eight-lane Illumina GA-II flow cell for multiplex sequencing.A total of 89 RNA samples obtained from in vitro and in vivo experiments were analyzed in this fashion. An average of 6.1 ± 2.5 million reads were generated per lane (n = 33 lanes), yielding a total of 7.3 gigabases of sequence data. Subsampling of the microbial RNA-Seq data sets indicated that the correlation between in vitro biological replicates of cultures either of the two human gut acetogens or of the saccharolytic human gut bacterium, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, reached an asymptote above 0.9 when the number of mRNA reads/sample was >300,000 (see supplemental text, “Sufficient Sequencing,” and Fig. 1A). The reliability of this method for profiling mRNA was further established by directly comparing RNA-Seq data sets generated from rRNA-depleted samples containing B. thetaiotaomicron RNA with 14 data sets generated from the starting nondepleted total RNA sample with custom Affymetrix GeneChips (these microarrays contain probesets to >98% of predicted genes in the organism's genome). We found a high correlation between both methods (r = 0.86) (Fig. 1B; also see supplemental text, “Comparisons with Affymetrix GeneChips”).Validation of microbial RNA-Seq. A, the correlation between biological replicates at different sequencing depths reached an asymptote above 0.9 for in vivo samples (blue circles, B. thetaiotaomicron in cecum) and in vitro samples (red circles, M. formatexigens grown on MBf medium with melibiose as a carbon source; green circles, B. hydrogenotrophica grown on MA4 medium with tryptone as a carbon source). B, mRNA abundances for RNA samples prepared from the ceca of B. thetaiotaomicron mono-associated mice (n = 4 samples from 4 animals) were highly correlated (r = 0.86) between Affymetrix GeneChip and RNA-Seq platforms. Comparable results were also found for bi-associations of B. thetaiotaomicron with B. hydrogenotrophica and M. formatexigens (n = 5 replicates each). Most of the discrepancies between the two methods involved transcripts detected at higher levels by RNA-Seq compared with GeneChip. C, the sequencing depth required to detect differential gene expression for microbial community members at different relative abundances was estimated by calculating the overlap between the fraction of genes differentially expressed at a given fold change threshold for a complete sample (M. formatexigens RNA; each of two replicate cultures grown in MBf medium plus melibiose or xylose) versus subsamples of the complete sample. With 200,000 reads, all 10-fold changes were found with zero false positives (blue circles). 6- and 3-fold changes (green and red circles, respectively) required greater sequencing depths to identify >80% of the differentially expressed genes. See Figs. S4 and S5 for additional analyses.To estimate the necessary sequencing depth for RNA profiling community members at variable abundances in the microbiota, we calculated the overlap between the fraction of genes differentially expressed during growth in vitro at a given fold change threshold for a complete sample (two replicates of 800,000 reads) and subsamples of the complete sample (either 50,000, 100,000, 300,000, 400,000, or 500,000 double-stranded cDNA reads; see supplemental text, “Sufficient Sequencing” for details). More than 80% of the 10-fold differentially expressed genes from the full sample were detectable with only 50,000 mRNA reads (Fig. 1C). Given the sequencing capacity of the Illumina GA-IIx instrument at the time these experiments were performed (∼18 million reads/lane) and our current mRNA enrichment ability, this suggests that the majority of 10-fold expression changes can be detected in all of the species present at 1.7% or more of a complex microbial community.Groups of 8-week-old germ-free mice were colonized with B. thetaiotaomicron alone or with B. thetaiotaomicron for 2–3 days followed by B. hydrogenotrophica or M. formatexigens for 14 days (n = 4–5 mice/experiment; n = 3 independent experiments). In the presence of B. thetaiotaomicron, both acetogens robustly colonized the distal gut where they represented 13 ± 3% (B. hydrogenotrophica) and 22 ± 2% (M. formatexigens) of the two-member model communities (see Fig. 2 legend for absolute numbers). These levels of colonization are sufficient to detect expression changes in all community members with RNA-Seq.The impact of two human gut acetogens on microbial metabolism in the ceca of gnotobiotic mice. A, multiplex RNA-Seq analysis of the B. hydrogenotrophica transcriptome. The heat map shows selected B. hydrogenotrophica genes, expressed in the ceca of B. thetaiotaomicron (Bt)/B. hydrogenotrophica (Bh) bi-associated mice and in vitro during growth of B. hydrogenotrophica in MA4 medium containing nine different substrates.

D–H, cecal contents from mice, colonized with either acetogen plus B. thetaiotaomicron or with B. thetaiotaomicron alone, were assayed for NAD+, NADH (D; n = 4–5/group), polyglucose- and polyfructose-containing polysaccharides (E; n = 14–15/group), acetate (F; n = 14–15 animals/group), succinate (G; n = 14–15/group), and propionate (H; n = 14–15/group). The mean values ± S.E. are plotted. *, p < 0.05 based on analysis of variance, except B and C (Student's t test). Quantitative PCR assays revealed the following levels of colonization in the different groups of mice studied: B. thetaiotaomicron mono-association, 7.5 × 1010 ± 1.3 × 1010 genome equivalents/g of wet cecal content, B. thetaiotaomicron/B. hydrogenotrophica bi-association, 6.5 × 1010 ± 9.3 × 109 (B. thetaiotaomicron), 9.4 × 109 ± 2.1 × 109 (B. hydrogenotrophica), and B. thetaiotaomicron/M. formatexigens (Mf) bi-association, 3.1 × 1010 ± 6.3 × 109 (B. thetaiotaomicron), 8.4 ± 109 ± 6.3 × 108 (M. formatexigens); n = 4–5 animals group (three independent experiments).We applied microbial RNA-Seq to (i) frozen samples of cecal luminal contents harvested from B. thetaiotaomicron/B. hydrogenotrophica bi-associated mice consuming a standard chow diet at the time of their sacrifice (n = 3) and (ii) samples of in vitro cultures representing nine different conditions (mid-log phase in media containing glucose, fructose, ribose, pyruvate, phenylalanine, valine, isoleucine, or tryptone as carbon sources plus stationary phase in cells grown with glucose) (n = 2–3 cultures/condition; Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S2, A–I). The choice of these carbon sources was guided by a list of 556 B. hydrogenotrophica genes whose expression was defined as significantly increased in the ceca of bi-associated mice compared with growth in vitro with glucose (fold difference>3; PPDE > 0.99; supplemental Table S2A). This list included 16 genes up-regulated in vivo and predicted to be involved in fermentation of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S2A). By identifying genes that B. hydrogenotrophica uses for growth in medium containing each of these carbon sources, RNA-Seq allowed us to define and interpret the metabolic pathways that it deploys in the ceca of gnotobiotic mice. For example, for in vitro growth on aliphatic amino acids, B. hydrogenotrophica up-regulates genes encoding an ABC transporter and enzymes required for the transformation of valine, leucine, and isoleucine to oxidized branched chain fatty acids (isobutyrate, isovalerate, and 2-methylbutyrate, respectively); these enzymes include an amino acid aminotransferase (Rumhyd0546), a 2-keto acid oxidoreductase (Rumhyd0549–Rumhyd0551), a phosphate acyltransferase (Rumhyd0555), and a fatty acid kinase (Rumhyd0554) (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S2, C and H). B. hydrogenotrophica also induces a pathway for fermentation of aromatic amino acids in vitro and in vivo that has been described in Archaea, where the transaminated forms of these amino acids are subjected to oxidative decarboxylation by an indolepyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (30) (Fig. 2A and supplemental Table S2D).Tandem mass spectrometry confirmed that bi-associated mice have significantly lower cecal levels of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids compared with B. thetaiotaomicron mono-associated animals (Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S3A). Furthermore, end products of aromatic amino acid fermentation were present at significantly higher levels in the ceca of the bi-associated mice (Fig. 2C and supplemental Table S3B). Fermentation of aliphatic and aromatic amino acids yields reducing equivalents and CO2 that can be captured via Wood-Ljungdahl pathway for production of acetyl-CoA. Microbial RNA-Seq verified that genes in the pathway are highly expressed in vitro in the presence of phenylalanine, valine, and isoleucine and established that, in the cecum, pathway components account for ∼5% of all expressed B. hydrogenotrophica mRNAs.A locus encoding an ABC sugar transporter system (Rumhyd0280–Rumhyd0282) plus several genes involved in glycolysis (glucokinase (Rumhyd0283), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Rumhyd0284), and phosphofructokinase (Rumhyd0285)) that is highly expressed in the presence of glucose and other simple sugars (i.e. fructose and ribose) during log phase growth in vitro exhibited significantly lower levels of expression in the ceca of bi-associated mice (Fig. 2A). Follow-up GC/MS revealed that levels of simple sugars including glucose, tagatose/fructose/sorbose, and ribose were low and in some cases below the limit of detection in the ceca of bi-associated mice consuming a complex plant polysaccharide-rich chow diet (supplemental Table S3B).In a primary fermenter, such as B. thetaiotaomicron, accumulation of H2 inhibits reoxidation of NADH. We found that the presence of B. hydrogenotrophica caused a significant decrease in the cecal [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio (Fig. 2D), despite increased consumption of cecal glucans, in bi-compared with mono-associated animals, i.e. more bacterial fermentation occurred with co-colonization (Fig. 2E). In addition, GC/MS revealed that compared with B. thetaiotaomicron mono-associated controls, co-colonization (bi-association) with B. thetaiotaomicron and B. hydrogenotrophica resulted in significantly higher levels of acetate in the cecum (Fig. 2F) and a 10% increase in serum acetate levels (p < 0.05; Student's t test). Integrating our RNA-Seq and metabolic profiling results, we concluded that the increased level of acetate observed in bi-associated compared with B. thetaiotaomicron mono-associated mice is likely a consequence of H2 removal by B. hydrogenotrophica, which promotes bacterial fermentation and acetogenesis from amino acids, fructose, H2, and CO2. Acetogens typically require a higher partial pressure of H2 for efficient consumption compared with methanogens (20), so their ability to use organic carbon sources as well as H2 and CO2 likely conveys an advantage while competing for nutrients in the distal gut.In the presence of B. thetaiotaomicron, levels of B. hydrogenotrophica colonization are ∼1000-fold greater as judged by quantitative PCR (9.4 × 109 ± 2.1 × 109 genome equivalents/g of wet cecal contents (n = 15 bi-associated mice) versus 8.1 × 106 ± 3.1 × 106 (n = 5 mono-associated animals; p < 0.01, t test)). Removal of H2 by B. hydrogenotrophica allows B. thetaiotaomicron to regenerate NAD+, which can then be used for glycolysis (Fig. 2D). However, cecal levels of B. thetaiotaomicron colonization (Fig. 2 legend) and its transcriptional profile are not significantly impacted by the presence or absence of B. hydrogenotrophica (criteria, fold change > 3; PPDE > 0.99). Note that the cecal levels of B. hydrogenotrophica in mono-associated mice were too low to obtain sufficient microbial biomass from individual animals for RNA-Seq profiling of the acetogen's transcriptome.The biochemical changes elicited by M. formatexigens in the ceca of B. thetaiotaomicron-containing gnotobiotic mice contrast sharply with the changes caused by the H2-consuming B. hydrogenotrophica. Despite relatively high levels of M. formatexigens colonization (27 ± 2% of the levels achieved by B. thetaiotaomicron; n = 15 bi-associated animals), the concentration of acetate in the ceca and sera of bi-associated animals was not significantly different compared with B. thetaiotaomicron mono-associated controls (Fig. 2F).GC/MS analysis disclosed that the concentrations of formate in the ceca of B. thetaiotaomicron mono-associated and B. thetaiotaomicron/M. formatexigens bi-associated mice were equivalent (2.7 ± 0.5 mm versus 2.5 ± 0.3, respectively; n = 5 animals assayed/group; p > 0.5 analysis of variance) but 20-fold lower than the concentration shown to result in homoacetogenesis in vitro (i.e. where acetate is the sole end product of fermentation by M. formatexigens) (31). In vitro studies had indicated that at this low level of formate, M. formatexigens ferments carbohydrates to a mixture of succinate, acetate, and lactate in vitro (31). We found that a similar effect occurs in vivo; succinate levels were significantly higher in the ceca of B. thetaiotaomicron/M. formatexigen bi-associated animals compared with B. thetaiotaomicron mono-associated (or B. thetaiotaomicron/B. hydrogenotrophica co-colonized) mice (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, RNA-Seq studies of M. formatexigens growing in vitro in defined minimal medium with glucose revealed that varying formate levels from 0 to 45 mm did not affect the levels of expression of acetyl-CoA pathway components (supplemental text). This observation suggests that the acetyl-CoA pathway is not highly regulated by the addition of its substrates, at least in the presence of these organic carbon sources. A similar conclusion was made based on RNA-Seq assays of the response of B. hydrogenotrophica to the addition of H2 or CO2 to the headspace of in vitro cultures. The molecular details of how acetogens regulate the acetyl-CoA pathway remain obscure (17). A study with M. thermoacetica, a soil acetogen that can use nitrate as an electron acceptor, showed that in some cases the presence of nitrate resulted in a small decrease in the level of mRNA encoding carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and lower enzymatic activity (32, 33).Compared with B. thetaiotaomicron mono-associated controls, the presence of M. formatexigens produced a modest but statistically significant 2.5-fold decrease (p < 0.05) in the cecal levels of B. thetaiotaomicron (Fig. 2 legend). There was also a concomitant and statistically significant decrease in the cecal concentration of propionate (Fig. 2H), a principal end product of B. thetaiotaomicron fermentation that M. formatexigens does not generate (39) (the M. formatexigens genome lacks genes coding for key enzymes in propionate-generating pathways, such as propionate CoA transferase/lactate CoA transferase, lactoyl-CoA dehydratase (acrylate pathway), and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (conversion of succinate to propionate)).To assess whether B. thetaiotaomicron and M. formatexigens compete for similar substrates, we examined the transcriptional responses of M. formatexigens and B. thetaiotaomicron when they co-colonized the ceca of mice, when B. thetaiotaomicron was the sole inhabitant, and when M. formatexigens was in the log phase of anaerobic growth in vitro with glucose as its sole source of carbon. The B. thetaiotaomicron genome contains 261 genes annotated in the CAZy database as encoding known or predicted glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases; most of these genes occur in genomic clusters, termed polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs); 88 of these PULs have been identified to date, contain 866 genes, and comprise almost 18% of its genome (34, 35). In the presence of M. formatexigens, B. thetaiotaomicron increased the expression of only two PULs relative to mono-association (>3-fold, PPDE > 0.99; supplemental Table S4). One of these PULs is involved in degrading host mucin O-glycans (BT0865–0867), a prominent host substrate that B. thetaiotaomicron forages in vivo (34). There were no down-regulated PULs. Thus, it appears that M. formatexigens, despite its arsenal of glycoside hydrolases (supplemental Table S1D), has a small impact on the carbohydrate metabolism of B. thetaiotaomicron.Microbial RNA-Seq identified more than 500 M. formatexigens genes whose expression is significantly greater in the ceca of bi-associated mice compared with log phase cultures in MBf medium (defined in the supplemental text) (criteria; >3-fold difference; PPDE > 0.99). Eighteen loci, composed of genes encoding ABC-type sugar transporters and in many cases adjacent co-expressed glycoside hydrolases, were among the most highly up-regulated in vivo (supplemental Table S5A) (note that BLAST analysis against 123 sequenced bacterial genomes, representing various cultured human gut-derived phylotypes, revealed that these modules of transcriptionally co-regulated genes involved in carbohydrate catabolism are commonly found in other Firmicutes but not in Bacteroidetes).To identify the substrates that activate expression of these loci, we applied RNA-Seq to M. formatexigens during log phase growth in MBf medium containing one of 15 different carbon sources. These substrates were selected based on the predicted functions of genes that exhibited significantly higher expression in vivo versus in vitro with glucose as the sole carbon source, as well as from a panel of 30 substrates that we tested for their ability to support growth of this acetogen in vitro (supplemental Table S6). The results (supplemental Table S5, B–Q) revealed that M. formatexigens has the capacity to degrade naturally occurring plant-derived oligosaccharides, in particular substrates containing α-galactosidic linkages that are not accessible to the host (e.g. stachyose and raffinose). RNA-Seq also confirmed that the metabolism of these oligosaccharides is associated with the induction of a subset of the loci referred to above that encode a predicted ABC transporter, an extracellular substrate binding protein, and one or more membrane-spanning or intracellular glycoside hydrolases.RNA-Seq indicated that M. formatexigens consumes microbial and host-derived glycans such as N-acetylglucosamine in vivo; three ABC transporters plus enzymes involved in N-acetylglucosamine metabolism (e.g. NAG-deacetylase) that are induced in vitro by N-acetylglucosamine are up-regulated in the cecum (supplemental Fig. S2). An analogous set of transcriptional responses was observed with several mono- and disaccharides including galactose, fructose, xylose, arabinose, cellobiose, and trehalose (supplemental Fig. S2).Together, these results suggest that B. thetaiotaomicron and M. formatexigens occupy different niches in the distal gut; the former feasts on complex host and plant-derived polysaccharides (e.g. pectins, starch, and mannans) (36), whereas the acetogen consumes mono- and oligosaccharides. GC/MS provided support for this conclusion; oligosaccharides such as cellobiose, lactulose, and lactobionic acid were present in the ceca of B. thetaiotaomicron mono-associated mice but were depleted in bi-associated animals (supplemental Table S3B).Using feces instead of cecal contents to assess the transcriptomes of members of model human gut microbial communities provides the great advantage of being able to evaluate the niches of component organisms over time and in response to defined perturbations, such as changes in diet or additions of other organisms, in a single animal so that it can serve as its own control. As a prelude to such future studies, we examined how the different microbes included in the present study modified their transcriptomes as they exited the cecum and were freshly expelled in feces. RNA-Seq of B. thetaiotaomicron disclosed a set of genes that are differentially expressed in feces relative to the cecum in mono-associated mice as well as in both groups of bi-associated animals (threshold cut-offs for fold differences in expression, >10 and <−10; PPDE ≥ 0.99; n = 8 fecal RNA samples from 2–3 mice profiled per group; supplemental Table S7, A–C). A B. thetaiotaomicron locus (BT2420–2425) encoding an osmosensitive sensing and K+ transporting system was among the most highly up-regulated in feces compared with cecum (supplemental Fig. S3A and Table S7A). Because potassium serves as an osmoprotectant and accumulates in the microbe in response to elevated external osmolarity (37), this locus likely helps to prevent cellular dehydration in the fecal environment. A similar system was also up-regulated by M. formatexigens in feces relative to cecum (supplemental Table S7D and Fig. S3B). The genome of B. hydrogenotrophica encodes homologs of these genes (Rumhyd3698–3705) that are also expressed at higher levels in feces relative to the ceca of bi-associated animals. However, these changes do not pass our stringent cut-off for significance; in fact, B. hydrogenotrophica did not exhibit any statistically significant differences in gene expression between feces and cecum in bi-associated mice, including genes involved in the acetyl-CoA pathway. Thus, transcriptional changes observed in feces relative to the cecum are mostly stress- and osmotic balance-related, suggesting that microbial gene expression profiles obtained from feces may serve as useful proxies for exploring organismal niches in more proximal regions of the gut.In this report, we describe a generally applicable approach for characterizing the niches of sequenced members of the human gut microbiota that (i) uses microbial RNA-Seq to profile their transcriptomes in defined locations of the intestines of gnotobiotic mice, (ii) further interprets the resulting data sets through multiplex RNA-Seq-based profiling of the organisms during in vitro growth on substrates whose utilization is suggested by in silico metabolic reconstructions of in vivo mRNA profiling data, and (iii) takes advantage of the RNA-Seq data to guide quantitative mass spectrometric assays of metabolites present in the gut habitat.Applying this paradigm to B. hydrogenotrophica and M. formatexigens has provided insights about the role of acetogenic bacteria in the mammalian gut. Pioneering work in wood-feeding termites had shown that acetogenesis constitutes a major H2 sink and that production of acetate from H2 and CO2 via the acetyl-CoA pathway makes an important contribution to host nutrition (38,–40). In addition, previous studies have indicated that acetogens can thrive in a wide variety of other environments including the intestines of rodents, ruminants, and kangaroos (23, 41, 42). Our findings in gnotobiotic mice are consistent with the notion that a human gut-derived strain of B. hydrogenotrophica can function as a component of a H2 sink in its distal gut habitat. In contrast, the effects documented in vivo with M. formatexigens suggest that at least under the conditions tested (i.e. a simplified community), this bacterium does not have an impact on community redox status (as evidenced by the [NADH]/[NAD+] ratios) and does not generate significant amounts of acetate despite its ability to consume carbohydrates. It is not clear whether the requirement of formate for acetogenesis seen in M. formatexigens is a common trait among human gut acetogens. However, whereas H2 is generally considered as the principal currency for interspecies electron transfer, formate can serve the same role (43). Thus, it seems likely that in the context of complex communities, where more formate may be produced, M. formatexigens may help improve fermentation and produce acetate as the main product of its metabolism (26).Several reports have suggested that acetogens, methanogens, and sulfate reducers compete with one another for H2 in the human distal colon (10, 11, 44), whereas other studies indicate that they may co-exist at high levels (45). A greater change in Gibbs free energy is associated with the reduction of sulfate by H2 than with the reduction of CO2 by H2 to methane or acetate (46). In addition, under pure culture conditions, the average H2 threshold (i.e. lowest concentration of H2 that can be utilized) of acetogens is significantly higher than the average H2 threshold of SRB and methanogens (20, 47). Our metagenomic analysis disclosed that components of the Wood-Ljundahl pathway for acetogenesis were more broadly and more highly represented in the human families surveyed than components of pathways for methanogenesis or sulfate reduction. In addition, our transcriptional and metabolic analyses in gnotobiotic mice demonstrated that acetogens can access a broad range of substrates for growth, including mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides as well as aromatic and aliphatic amino acids. Given these findings, we hypothesize that this broad substrate range confers a fitness advantage to acetogens while competing for H2 and formate, even when methanogens and SRB are present. This hypothesis is supported by studies of termite gut acetogens indicating that their ability to grow mixotrophically (i.e. to simultaneously utilize organic substrates and H2 for energy) confers a growth advantage over H2-consuming methanogens (48, 49). Nonetheless, the dynamic nature of the gut ecosystem (e.g. fluctuations in its chemical environment including pH, dietary substrates, mucus glycans, peristaltic movement of its luminal contents, and morphologic variations along its cephalocaudal axis) may provide a variety of ecological niches that favor the co-existence of different types of acetogens and other classes of H2 consumers.Nutritional status is among the most important, modifiable determinants of global human health. The nutritional value of food is not an absolute entity but rather is influenced in part by the collection of microbes present in the guts of consumers. Understanding how the gut microbiota affects the nutritional status of a host requires that we determine the metabolic niches of key microbial community members, such as H2-consuming bacteria and archaeons. Characterizing interactions among acetogens, methanogens, and SRB, the niches they occupy in the presence of various other gut bacterial phylotypes as a function of diet, and their metabolic impact on the host may provide new therapeutic avenues for enhancing our nutritional status and modifying our energy balance. Creating a defined human gut microbiota in gnotobiotic mice composed of sequenced members with or without various groups of H2 consumers, coupled with RNA-Seq and GC/MS analyses, should be useful for conducting proof-of-principle and proof-of-mechanism tests of this idea.We thank David O'Donnell, Maria Karlsson, and Sabrina Wagoner for help with various aspects of gnotobiotic husbandry; Jill Manchester for assistance with biochemical assays; Jessica Hoisington-López for participation in cDNA sequencing; Bernard Henrissat for CAZy annotations; and Eric Martens, Henning Seedorf, Liz Hansen, and Andrew Goodman for helpful comments during the course of these studies.

PMC2907334,Functional network of glycan-related molecules: Glyco-Net in Glycoconjugate Data Bank,False,"Glycans are involved in a wide range of biological process, and they play an essential role in functions such as cell differentiation, cell adhesion, pathogen-host recognition, toxin-receptor interactions, signal transduction, cancer metastasis, and immune responses. Elucidating pathways related to post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as glycosylation are of growing importance in post-genome science and technology. Graphical networks describing the relationships among glycan-related molecules, including genes, proteins, lipids and various biological events are considered extremely valuable and convenient tools for the systematic investigation of PTMs. However, there is no database which dynamically draws functional networks related to glycans.We have created a database called Glyco-Net http://www.glycoconjugate.jp/functions/, with many binary relationships among glycan-related molecules. Using search results, we can dynamically draw figures of the functional relationships among these components with nodes and arrows. A certain molecule or event corresponds to a node in the network figures, and the relationship between the molecule and the event are indicated by arrows. Since all components are treated equally, an arrow is also a node.In this paper, we describe our new database, Glyco-Net, which is the first database to dynamically show networks of the functional profiles of glycan related molecules. The graphical networks will assist in the understanding of the role of the PTMs. In addition, since various kinds of bio-objects such as genes, proteins, and inhibitors are equally treated in Glyco-Net, we can obtain a large amount of information on the PTMs.Glycans are involved in a wide range of biological process, and they play an essential role in functions such as cell-cell interaction, pathogen-host recognition, toxin-receptor interaction, signal transduction.[1-5] One of their roles are modulating the functions of many proteins and lipids through post-translational modifications (PTMs).[6] Glycomics is the study of the structural and functional aspects of various glycoconjugates, such as glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans produced during PTMs in cells and organisms. The field of glycomics has lagged behind that of genomics and proteomics, mainly because of the inherent difficulties in the analysis of glycan structure and function.[7] However, glycomics is now an emerging field due to exceptional progress in the development of modern experimental techniques and equipment including mass spectrometry (MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and knockout mice.[8-15] It is expected that a large quantity of information concerning glycan structure and function will be accumulated. Bioinformatics of glycans, which used to suffer from a lack of data in early studies, is now becoming a practical field in the biological sciences related to PTMs. Therefore, the construction of a new class glycan database indicating the relationship between structures and their functions and the development of related tools is strongly required from biological, pharmaceutical and medical fields.There are several groups energetically developing both public and commercial glycan databases. For instance, some of the public databases are KEGG [16-18], SWEET-DB [19] in the GLYCOSCIENCES.de [20], the United States Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) [21], and GlycoSuiteDB in The Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) Proteomics Server [22]. GlycoMinds http://www.glycominds.com is known as the commercial database. The Complex Carbohydrate Structure Database (CCSD) [23,24] is the first database of glycan structures. The CCSD was developed in the 1980s and 1990s by the CarbBank Project and was discontinued in 1999 due to the lack of funding. The data of the CCSD are currently included in the public glycan databases as mentioned above. Although the web service of GLYCOSCIENCES.de is currently not available, they are trying to organize the new base for their database. The Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme (CAZy) database is known as a database of enzymes relating to glycans, such as glycosyltransferases and lectins [25]. All of these databases with the exception of CAZy are focused on glycan structures. The SWEET-DB mainly develops the tools with which to treat the glycan structures and geometry [26-29]. The CFG is constructing carbohydrate chips to investigate the interaction between carbohydrates and proteins for therapy, and databases for functional glycomics, such as an annotated database of mass spectrometry. The KEGG GLYCAN database also has over 10,000 glycan structures; in addition, a manually drawn graphical pathway for various bio-molecules is included in KEGG PATHWAY. The Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) http://www.expasy.org/ which includes a protein sequence database also holds many graphical figures of biochemical pathways. Krambeck and Betenbaugh [30] and Liu et al. [31] have developed a system which dynamically constructs a structural network regarding N- and O-linked glycans, respectively.Recently, emerging analytical techniques enabled us to obtain a great deal of information about the relationships, not only between the glycan structures and functions, but also among glycans, phenotypes of diseases and expression of glycan-related genes. In this situation, graphical networks describing the relationships among glycan-related molecules, including genes, proteins, lipids and biological events are considered to become potential tools for accelerating the integrated study of PTMs. Although the KEGG PATHWAY and Biochemical Pathways in ExPASy http://us.expasy.org/cgi-bin/show_thumbnails.pl have graphical network figures, these are all manually selected and organized. Since glycomics and glycoproteomics data are expected to increase substantially, it is clear that the network figures generated from the glycan structures should be drawn based on the available updated data in order to give the most current overview of glycan functions.We have endeavoured to dynamically draw figures of functional networks among glycans, genes, inhibitors, lipids, glycosphingolipids, various biological events, diseases and carbohydrate-binding proteins such as glycosyltransferases and lectins (hereafter, these are denoted as ""bio-objects"") for several years. Dynamic generation of the network figures within bio-objects is more progressive than networks of biosynthesis with static pictures such as KEGG PATHWAY and ExPASy. Glyco-Net was constructed as a part of the Glycoconjugate Data Bank (GDB) http://www.glycoconjugate.jp/. Each bio-object in Glyco-Net is linked to the other databases to obtain more detailed information, since Glyco-Net has been focusing on the collection of the functional relationships among bio-objects from research articles. In this paper, we describe the concept and status of Glyco-Net.Glyco-Net dynamically draws functional networks in a variety of bio-objects relating to known glycans. Binary relations among glycan-related information are accumulated, as shown on the left side of Figure ​Figure1.1. Two bio-objects are connected by a ""verb"" which expresses the function of a bio-object, for example ""Sugar A links to Sugar B"" in Figure ​Figure1a.1a. A function ""A link to"" means alpha linkage of formed glycoside bond after sugar transformation. A bio-object is described as a node, and a ""verb"" is expressed as an arrow in the functional network. We use over 100 verbs in Glyco-Net which are listed in Additional file 1. In order to make a network figure, the same bio-objects are superimposed at the node, which is shown on the right hand side of Figure ​Figure1b.1b. The binary relationships for bio-objects have been curated manually. We are now constructing a kind of ontology in the wide field of glycan-related research in order to automatically gather the above binary relationships from the web articles such as PubMed http://www.pubmed.org, and this will be discussed further in our future articles. This ontology will be a powerful tool in the near future even though we should verify the data by sight.Concept of Glyco-Net. a) Function list. Two bio-objects (or functions) are connected with an arrow. The function on the third row of Figure 1a shows ""enzyme1 catalyzes (Function3) Function1"". This is an example of a function behaving as a node. b) Functional network made from a), superimposing the same bio-objects and functions.The functional networks are dynamically created by using the stacked binary relationships. Since all bio-objects (nodes) and functions (arrows) are treated equally in Glyco-Net, an arrow behaves as a node in some cases. This feature enables us to draw flexible networks. Glyco-Net also holds a linkage which is displayed in the object tables to obtain the detailed information of the bio-objects from the other biological databases, though the linkages are not available from the network figures. Therefore the development of clickable linkage on the network figures would lead to the further examination. Following linkages are listed in Table ​Table1:1: the genes entries hold the linkage to search the gene in GenBank [32], sugar entries have the linkages to KEGG GLYCAN, the enzyme entries have the linkage to the enzyme database ENZYME in ExPASy, and the disease entries have linkage to a disease database such as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and literature databases such as PubMed.List of linkages from Glyco-NetGlyco-Net is expected to be used as an interface between the various biological databases and the functional network of glycan-related bio-objects. The current notation of carbohydrate structures is ad hoc. There are various structural databases, such as KEGG GLYCAN, GLYCOSCIENCES.de, and CFG. Thus, it is only necessary to give the linkage from our glycan data to enter these databases. At the moment, Glyco-Net holds limited linkage to carbohydrate structure databases. We will modify the nomenclature of the carbohydrate structures with a more standard one, such as GLYDE [33], to make it accessible in other databases with the carbohydrate structure as a key.Implementation of our database was carried out with a MySQL database system and a Linux environment. The interface web page was written in JavaServer Pages (JSP). The search engine and the drawing method were written in Java Programming language.Glyco-Net aims to collect binary relations that could be extracted by going through the scientific articles such as research papers, i.e. evidence of functions by specific assays. These data were manually curated from the ""Handbook of Glycosyltransferases and Related Genes."" [34] Functions with different experimental conditions in the assay are all recognized as different functions and existed in the network figure at the same time. It is necessary to classify the functions with ontology according to the experimental conditions and/or the environment where the bio-objects are in so that the quantitative discussion can be carried out.Glyco-Net consists of four categories of data which are shown in Table ​Table2.2. The first category is the ""function"", which describes the relationships between biological objects. The second one is the ""object"", which describes the detailed information of biological objects such as genes, proteins, lipids, glycans, and diseases. The third one is the ""assay"", which provides information on assays from which the functions are suggested. In addition, the references are found in the ""article"" category. These categories of data are divided into several tables, for example, the ""object"" is divided into seven tables called ""sugar"", ""protein complex"", ""protein"", ""gene"", ""lipid"", ""disease"" and ""event"". Relationships between articles and other tables are described in the ""reference"" table. Detailed data structures are provided in the Additional file 1.Annotation and data in Glyco-NetCurrently, Glyco-Net has 3,724 objects (1,149 objects for glycosyltransferases, 2,480 objects for genes, and 95 pieces of data concerning diseases caused by or related to carbohydrate abnormalities), 2,302 pieces of function data, and 1,201 pieces of data concerning the assay that verifies the functions of the glycoconjugates. Records (1,332) are also contained in the ""article"" category. Data which referenced from any articles that published after Reference 34 will be updated in the future. Furthermore, we have been developing ontology regarding Glyco-Net.The main page of the Glycoconjugate Data Bank http://www.glycoconjugate.jp provides three links to databases, including 1) ""Resources"", which is a database of carbohydrate-related compounds, 2) ""Structure"" [35], which is a 3D structure database of glycans extracted from the Protein Data Bank and 3) ""Glyco-Net"", which shows the functional network of carbohydrate-related molecules. We can browse several function lists and network figures by clicking the bio-object type or typing the keyword to see the details of the functions.Figure ​Figure22 shows a simple example of the search results from Glyco-Net. Figure ​Figure2a2a shows the result of keyword search ""adhere"" and several functions were found. The function list includes the function ID, the function itself, a detailed description of the function, and the comments in the function tables. Figure ​Figure2b2b shows the details of an object ""cancer cell"". In the table, the object ID, the object type, the object name, the synonyms, and the comments of the object are shown. The list of functions with the objects is shown in the part of the table. The ""HOPS"" number refers to the number of nodes from the object which consists of functions or objects in the table linked to the selected object of ""cancer cells"". In this sample search, the HOPS was set to 2. Currently, HOPS was limited to five in Glyco-Net due to our technical problem. The limitation of the HOPS number could cause ambiguous results by partly drawing network figures. In order to obtain fully accurate network figures, we are developing a novel drawing method and will update the drawing routine in the near future. By clicking the ""Show Diagram"" button, a figure of the functional network is shown as Figure ​Figure2c.2c. Topology in the figure might vary as redrawing. In addition, the resolution of the figure can be changed by selecting the size of the figure. The default size of the figure is 1024 × 768 dots. Figure ​Figure2c2c shows a simple example that a function ""Cancer cells adhere to metastatic sites."" (Function ID is F0000914) is enhanced by poly-N-acetyllactosamine (Function ID is F0000913). Furthermore, since all bio-objects are treated equally, arrows have a node that is the same as other bio-objects such as ""cancer cell"". This is a characteristic feature of Glyco-Net. According to the value of the HOPS number, the networks would grow substantially. However, the network figures are quite complicated for a large HOPS.A search result in Glyco-Net. a) Search results with the word ""adhere"". b) A detail of bio-object cancer cell (O0000684). This table has ID, TYPE, NAME, SYNONYMS, and COMMENT fields. The bottom of this table shows the function list corresponding to a certain HOPS. c) A dynamic network figure for bio-object O0000684 within HOPS of 2.Figure ​Figure33 shows a slightly more complex network than Figure ​Figure2c.2c. The ""cause"" is the function that increases in hyaluronan synthase-1 causes cancer metastasis. Any function which relates to the object itself is expressed as a round arrow returning to the object. From the rest of the network figure we can discern that hyaluronan synthase-1 catalyzes two glycosylation reactions, including the formation of glycoside linkages between glucuronic acids (GlcA) and GlcNAcβ1-4(GlcAβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-4)n and between N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and (GlcAβ1-3GlcNAcβ1-4)n. This is consistent with the actual function of the hyaluronan synthase-1 that synthesizes hyaluronic acids which are comprised of repeats of the GlcA-GlcNAc disaccharide unit.Function network figure of functions of hyaluronan synthase-1. This network figure shows that 1) an increase of hyaluronan synthase-1 causes cancer metastasis, 2) hyaluronan synthase-1 catalyses a Glcuronic acid transfer reaction, and 3) hyaluronan synthase-1 also catalyzes a GlcNActransfer reaction (see details in the text).In this paper, we describe our new database, Glyco-Net, which shows graphical networks of glycan-related bio-objects such as genes, proteins, glycoproteins, lipids, glycolipids, and glycans. Each bio-object can easily be linked to the available databases such as GenBank, ExPASy, KEGG GLYCAN, GLYCOSCIENCES.de, CFG, and PubMed, though the linkage is limited from the bio-object tables at the present time. Dynamic generation of the functional network figures among bio-objects is expected to have great advantages compared with KEGG PATHWAY and ExPASy which hold static figures for biosynthesis. Since various kinds of bio-objects such as genes, proteins and inhibitors are equally treated in Glyco-Net, a large amount of information on the PTMs can be obtained. Although these characteristics are the novel implementation in the existing glycan databases, figures made by Glyco-Net are still complicated to adapt to a larger HOPS at this stage. In addition, the quantity of total data in Glyco-Net still remains a small. Therefore, we are now constructing ontology for partly automatic curation from web articles. An automatic curation with ontology will become a quite powerful tool, even though collected data should be verified carefully by scientists. We will also develop a routine to clearly draw the functional network figures. Furthermore, the nomenclature of the glycan structure should be standardized in order to search the glycans in other structure-based carbohydrate databases without uncertainty. Use of GLYDE notation is found to be quite feasible, since only our database indicates the relationships among biological objects relating to glycans. As a result, the details of the objects have to be found in other databases, and we will have to increase the linkages from our objects to other databases. Thus, the establishment of the collaboration with researchers in bioinformatics and other biosciences to improve this new type of database is the significant asset for the further development of Glyc-Net.URL of Glyco-Net is http://www.glycoconjugate.jp/functions/.RH designed and constructed the database.

PMC2911314,The K5 Lyase KflA Combines a Viral Tail Spike Structure with a Bacterial Polysaccharide Lyase Mechanism*,False,"K5 lyase A (KflA) is a tail spike protein (TSP) encoded by a K5A coliphage, which cleaves K5 capsular polysaccharide, a glycosaminoglycan with the repeat unit [-4)-βGlcA-(1,4)- αGlcNAc(1-], displayed on the surface of Escherichia coli K5 strains. The crystal structure of KflA reveals a trimeric arrangement, with each monomer containing a right-handed, single-stranded parallel β-helix domain. Stable trimer formation by the intertwining of strands in the C-terminal domain, followed by proteolytic maturation, is likely to be catalyzed by an autochaperone as described for K1F endosialidase. The structure of KflA represents the first bacteriophage tail spike protein combining polysaccharide lyase activity with a single-stranded parallel β-helix fold. We propose a catalytic site and mechanism representing convergence with the syn-β-elimination site of heparinase II from Pedobacter heparinus.The KflA protein is a K5 lyase, an enzyme found as a tail spike protein of coliphages K5A (1, 2) and K1–5 (3), where it catalyzes depolymerization of K5 capsular polysaccharide. K5 lyase enables the phage to recognize and remove the protective K5 capsule around host bacteria, thereby exposing phage receptors in the outer membrane. The K5 capsular polysaccharide is a virulence factor of Escherichia coli K5 isolates, which are responsible for extraintestinal infections (4, 5). The polysaccharide is identical to N-acetyl-heparosan (heparan), a structure present in nonmodified regions of heparan sulfate, and KflA has been utilized previously to study the domain structure of heparan sulfate (6). A bacterial K5 lyase, ElmA, from E. coli K5 strain SEBR 3282 also has been described (7).The structures of several bacterial glycosaminoglycan-degrading lyases have been published: hyaluronate lyases (EC 4.2.2.1) and chondroitin AC lyases (EC 4.2.2.5) have catalytic N-terminal domains with (α/α)5 toroid topology and C-terminal β-sheet/sandwich domains (8,–10), they act at GlcA residues within their substrates. Chondroitin ABC lyases (11, 12) and heparinase II from Pedobacter heparinus (13) have overall structural similarity with these enzymes and can act at GlcA or IdoA (C5-epimerised GlcA) substrate residues, with each enzyme using two overlapping and epimer-specific catalytic groupings (12, 13). A heparin lyase (EC 4.2.2.7, heparinase I) from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron recently has been shown to have a β-jellyroll domain containing an IdoA-specific active site similar to the IdoA-specific site of heparinase II (14). Heparin-sulfate lyases (heparitinase or heparinase III, EC 4.2.2.8) act at GlcA residues of suitable substrates (15); no representative structure has yet been published, but these enzymes have sequence homology within the C-terminal β-sheet/sandwich domain of heparinase II. Chondroitinase B (EC 4.2.2.4) from Pedobacter heparinus (16, 17) is the only glycosaminoglycan lyase known to contain the right-handed parallel β-helix topology that we report here for KflA. It acts at IdoA residues within the substrate dermatan sulfate.The first reported structure of a bacteriophage-derived glycosaminoglycan lyase was that of the hyaluronate lyase HylP1, a tail fiber protein of the inducible prophage SF370.1 of Streptococcus pyogenes strain SF370 (18). HylP1 contains a catalytic domain with triple-stranded β-helix topology (TSβH),4 a fold previously observed in noncatalytic domains of other viral tail proteins, including bacteriophage T4 short tail fiber gp12 (19) and needle protein gp5 (20, 21). Short stretches of this fold also are found in the C-terminal domains of coliphage K1F endosialidase (22) and P22 TSP (23), where it acts to stabilize trimeric proteins. We report that this structure also is found within KflA.Viral tail spike proteins with predominantly single-stranded parallel β-helix architecture include Salmonella phage P22 TSP (23, 24), Shigella phage Sf6 TSP (25), and E. coli phage HK620 TSP (26). These are all glycoside hydrolases, facilitating host recognition and infection through binding and degradation of host O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide. This β-helix fold also is widely found in pectic lyases and some alginate lyases as well as in a small number of glycoside hydrolase subfamilies, including polygalacturonases, rhamnogalacturonases, and dextranases. Groupings of these enzymes based on structure and activity are described in the CAZy database (27).In this paper, we report the structure of KflA, which represents the first viral tail spike protein with polysaccharide lyase activity and a catalytic single-stranded β-helix domain, a combination frequently observed in bacterial polysaccharide lyases. Also, the proposed catalytic site resembles the syn-β-elimination site of heparinase II, despite the fact that these enzymes have a very different topology.The arabinose-inducible plasmid pLYA100 was used for expression, purification, and mutagenesis, as described previously (28), encoding an N-terminally His6-tagged variant of full-length K5 lyase (Swiss-Prot accession no. O09496) from coliphage K5A (His-KflA).Mutations of kflA within pLYA100 were generated by the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Each mutant of kflA used in this paper was fully sequenced to preclude mutations introduced by PCR. Errors were found in the published sequence of kflA, the new sequence revealed KflA is much more similar to K5 lyase from coliphage K1–5 (Swiss-Prot accession no. Q9AZ47) than previously determined (99% similarity, 98% identity, length of 632 amino acids). Based upon this sequence, the molecular mass of native KflA is predicted to be 66.9 kDa.His-KflA was expressed as described previously (28). Cells were lysed as described previously (28), but in a modified buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 12.5 mm imidazole) supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, P8849). The lysate was centrifuged (40,000 × g, 10 min, 10 °C), and the supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). His-KflA was eluted by increasing imidazole concentration to 250 mm in a linear gradient.Selenomethionine derivatized His-KflA (seleno-KflA) was purified as above from E. coli B834 (methionine auxotroph strain) transformed with pLYA100 grown in selenium-methionine medium (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.). Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.2% (w/v) l-arabinose when culture A600 reached 0.5.Mutant variants of His-KflA were screened by lyase assay of cell lysate supernatant from 50-ml cultures of E. coli DH5α harboring the corresponding plasmid, induced as for seleno-KflA. Cells were lysed in BugBuster reagent (Novagen). Cultures with low lyase activity were scaled up to 500 ml, and His-KflA variants were purified by nickel-affinity chromatography.Affinity-purified His-KflA was concentrated to 10 mg/ml by centrifugation over a 100-kDa cut-off membrane (Vivaspin 6, Vivascience). A 0.5-ml sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia), equilibrated, and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol (v/v) at 0.25 ml/min.SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (29), and unboiled SDS-PAGE samples were heated (37 °C for 30 min) prior to loading (supplemental Fig. S1, a and b). His-KflA content of purified samples was calculated from measurement of A280 (2-μl sample, in triplicate, by Nanodrop) using estimates of extinction coefficient and molecular mass calculated using ProtParam (30). Calculation of pKa values of ionizable groups using the solved structure were performed using H++ server at Virginia Tech (31, 32, 33).5The spectrophotometric assay described previously (28) was performed using a modified reaction buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl) at 37 °C, recording A232 (supplemental Fig. S2, summarized in Table 1). Initial screening assays were performed by incubating cell lysate supernatants (20 μl) in reaction buffer containing 250 μg K5 for 1 h at 37 °C before recording A232.Enzyme activity and molecular mass estimates of purified His-KflA and mutated variantsVmax is the initial rate of product formation (means ± S.E., μmol min−1 mg−1 purified enzyme) at 37 °C. Nondetectable activity is denoted by ND (detection limit shown in parentheses). Percentage activity relative to His-KflA is shown in parentheses (means ± S.E.). Initial substrate concentration was 500 μg K5 per 1 ml of reaction volume, and 1 μg of purified protein was used in each reaction, except for E206A and Lys208 mutant assays, where 5 μg purified protein was used. Molecular masses were estimated by light-scattering measurements.a The molecular mass was estimated via analytical ultracentrifugation (means ± S.E.).Crystals were grown from hanging drops; drops were formed by mixing 1 μl of 5.2 mg/ml His-KflA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol with an equal volume of well solution containing 0.2 m KBr and 10% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystallization was carried out at 20 °C. Needle-like crystals, with the approximate dimensions of 70 μm × 70 μm × 300 μm, formed within 7 days. For data collection, crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.4 m KBr, and 30% polyethylene glycol 400 for 10 min, followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Seleno-KflA failed to form crystals under the same conditions as His-KflA but could be crystallized by macroseeding smaller crystals derived from His-KflA into hanging drops of seleno-KflA, which had been set up under the same conditions as for His-KflA, and left for 4 days. Seeded crystals grew within 2–3 days and were subjected to cryoprotection in the same manner as His-KflA. Data were processed using XDS (34) for seleno-KflA and MOSFLM (35) for the His-KflA. Details of space groups, cell dimensions, and data collection statistics are given in Table 2.X-ray data processing and refinement statisticsa Values in parentheses refer to the outer resolution data shell.b Rmerge = ΣhklΣsym|I − 〈I〉|/ΣhklI.c r.m.s.d. indicates root mean square deviation.d Data are based on maximum likelihood from REFMAC5 (39).e Data are from PROCHECK (40).Experimental phases were derived from single wavelength anomalous diffraction data collected from a single seleno-KflA crystal. Density calculations and analysis of the self-rotation function indicated a trimer in the asymmetric unit. The locations of 21 selenium atoms of a possible 24 were located using SOLVE (36). These phases were inputted into PHENIX (37) and subjected to density modification and automated model building, which resulted in construction of most of the final model. The final stages of model building were conducted manually, using Coot (38), combined with refinement using REFMAC (39). The final model was complete for all residues from Pro7 to Thr504 on all three chains, and additionally contained 12 bromide ions. The geometry of the model was examined using PROCHECK (40): all main chain and side chain stereochemical parameters were found to be within the limits expected for a refined structure at 1.6-Å resolution. Atomic coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2X3H.His-KflA migrated on SDS-PAGE with an estimated mass of 57 kDa, and nonboiled samples migrated with an apparent mass of 123 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1a). Molecular mass estimated by gel permeation on a calibrated column was 173 kDa (data not shown). Light-scattering analysis and analytical ultracentrifugation of His-KflA gave estimated masses of 168 and 166 kDa, respectively (Table 1). These results suggest His-KflA forms oligomers as reported for K1 endosialidases, which exist in solution as SDS-resistant trimers (23, 41).As anticipated from biophysical analysis, the crystal structure of KflA revealed a trimeric complex. The overall structure of mature His-KflA comprises a trimer of three identical monomers intertwined at the carboxyl-terminal domain, with a central 3-fold non-crystallographic axis running along the main axis of the macromolecule (Fig. 1, a and b). The structure can be divided into three domains: a small α-helical domain at the N terminus, a central single-stranded, right-handed β-helix domain and a β-prism/triple-stranded β-helix domain at the C terminus (Fig. 1a).Structure of the KflA trimer. a, ribbon plot side view: the three monomers are shown in different colors, with the N terminus to the left. The separate domains within the structure are indicated. b, view down the 3-fold axis of KflA, from the C-terminal end of the molecule. c, surface plot of a single monomer from KflA, showing the proposed catalytic groove in the enzyme surface. The locations of Phe202, Glu206, Lys208, and Tyr229 side chains are shown; covalent bonds are colored according to participating atom type (green, carbon; blue, nitrogen; and red, oxygen).The β-helix contains 12 complete “winds,” with each containing three β-sheets termed PB1, PB2, and PB3, using the nomenclature of Yoder and Jurnak (42) separated by short turns (T1, T2, and T3), some of which have loop insertions. Within each monomer, PB1 sheets face away from the central trimer axis and form a solvent-exposed, concave cleft running along the axis of the β-helix. Three inter-monomeric clefts also exist along the trimeric axis (Fig. 1, a and b).The lumen of the KflA β-helix contains a stack of 12 hydrophobic residues along PB2 and a ladder of seven stacked Asn residues bordering T1 and PB2. KflA also contains a stack of four Ser residues within T1; this is a feature found in many β-helical proteins that is proposed to stabilize the tight turns between PB1 and PB2 sheets (42). Several intermonomeric contacts are formed along the cleft between β-helices of neighboring chains, including salt bridges exemplified by the pairings Asp290–Arg357 and Asp130–Lys193.The C-terminal domain of each mature KflA monomer consists of a pair of anti-parallel β-sheets, a pair of parallel β-sheets, and a single β-sheet (forming one turn of a triple-stranded β-helix) followed by five anti-parallel β-sheets (forming one face of a three-sided β-prism), ending in a spiraling coil. In this region, each monomer chain makes multiple contacts with each neighboring chain, effectively holding the trimer together through a 720° rotation (supplemental Fig. S3a). The extensive contacts between monomer chains in the trimeric structure may explain the high thermostability previously observed for KflA, with an unfolding transition point at 65 °C and peak enzyme activity at 44 °C (43).Based on the role of histidine and tyrosine side chains in the catalytic mechanisms proposed for other glycosaminoglycan lyases (10, 44,–48), the residues His226, Tyr229, His282, and Tyr253 were selected as targets for site-directed mutagenesis. These residues were individually exchanged for Ala and the resulting His-KflA mutants were assayed for lyase activity. The initial screening assay showed high activity levels (data not shown), comparable with nonmutated His-KflA, except in the case of Y229A. To examine the role of Tyr229 further, the Y229F variant was generated, and both Tyr229 mutants were purified by nickel affinity and assayed for lyase activity. The Y229F mutation reduced activity to ∼25%, whereas the Y229A variant had <2% activity compared with His-KflA (Table 1).Calculation of pKa values for ionizable residues in their local environments within the structure of KflA highlighted a large shift in the predicted pKa of Glu206 from ≤4.5 to ≥7.4. This side chain may therefore be readily protonated under physiological conditions. Glu206 is at the bottom of a narrow cleft formed by Phe202 and Lys208 (Fig. 1c), located centrally within the intramonomeric groove formed by PB1. This is a typical active site location in other β-helix enzymes. The pKa analysis also provides an explanation of the reduced activity of the Y229F mutant, as Tyr229 is predicted to be a major contributor to the raised pKa of Glu206, through electrostatic interaction. The observation of reduced lyase activity of the Y229A variant compared with the Y229F variant may reflect involvement of the benzyl ring of Tyr229 in substrate binding, possibly through a stacking interaction with pyranosyl sugar rings in the substrate.No lyase activity could be detected in variants of His-KflA containing mutations at Glu206 (E206A) or nearby Lys208 (K208A, K208R, and K208M) (Table 1). His-KflA and all purified variants behaved similarly during the expression and purification steps and had molecular masses consistent with trimer formation when analyzed by light scattering (Table 1). These trimers were also all SDS-resistant and temperature-labile (supplemental Fig. S1, a and b). A crystal structure of E206A confirmed that this mutant adopted the same structure as His-KflA (data not shown). Lyase assay curves for purified His-KflA, and variants are presented (supplemental Fig. S2). On the basis of these data, we propose that Glu206 and Lys208 are the catalytic residues in the β-elimination reaction catalyzed by KflA.The determination of the structure of KflA has revealed a number of interesting features. First, it forms a trimeric structure with each chain containing a single-stranded β-helix domain with a lyase catalytic site. Unlike K1F endosialidase, KflA is not a processive enzyme, and the trimeric state of KflA may ensure host attachment is maintained through constant partial occupancy of the substrate binding sites present in the trimer. KflA exhibits side chain stacking interactions within the β-helix, which is a common feature of many β-helices (42, 49, 50). The placement of the Asn ladder in KflA at the end of T1 is unusual; previously described β-helix proteins commonly have an internal Asn ladder within the short turn, T2 (50).A striking similarity was noted between the fold of the C-terminal β-prism/TSβH domain from KflA and the equivalent domain in K1F endosialidase (22). The KflA β-prism extends further than the equivalent fold in K1F endosialidase, with the result that the pairing between chains is altered, but both proteins retain essentially the same strand pattern (supplemental Fig. S3a). The structural similarity covers the last 98 amino acids of the mature proteins and is particularly noticeable throughout the last 31 amino acids, which have a root mean square deviation value of 0.94 Å using TM-align (51) in STRAP software (52). This region contains limited sequence homology between the two mature proteins toward the C terminus residues (41, 53, 54). The folding of this domain in K1F endosialidase, forming two regions of TSβH separated by a region of β-prism, has been proposed to account for the high thermostability of the trimeric structure (22). The TSβH found in the C-terminal domain of P22 TSP is described as a “clamp” holding the trimer together (55), contributing to the high thermostability of P22 TSP. It is likely that the intertwining of the three monomer strands in the C-terminal domain of KflA contributes greatly to the high thermostability observed previously for KflA, with an unfolding transition point at 65 °C and peak enzyme activity at 44 °C (43).Proteolytic maturation has been reported for K1 endosialidases (41) and ElmA (7). Sequence alignments show KflA contains a conserved post-translational cleavage site at Ser505 (41, 53, 54). The migration of His-KflA on SDS-PAGE at an apparent molecular mass of 57 kDa is consistent with cleavage at Ser505, removing a 14.6-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment to yield a 56.3-kDa mature protein. The predicted molecular mass of 168.9 kDa for mature, trimeric His-KflA is in good agreement with our analysis by gel permeation chromatography, light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation techniques.The domain removed during maturation has been described as an autochaperone assisting in folding and assembly of trimeric tail spike proteins, with the autolytic cleavage event contributing to stability by making unraveling of trimers energetically unfavorable (54). Recently, the structure and catalytic mechanism of the autochaperone of K1F endosialidase has been described (53). We have aligned the C-terminal region of KflA with the K1F autochaperone (supplemental Fig. S3b), further demonstrating the structural similarity between the C-terminal domains of K1F endosialidase and KflA.The autochaperone domain contains a highly basic region located on the C-terminal α-helix, which is well conserved within K5 lyases and K1 endosialidases (41) and which closely resembles a Cardin-Weintraub motif (43, 56, 57). This motif is implicated in binding of glycosaminoglycans and was previously proposed to contribute to substrate recognition and binding by KflA (43). The observation of this motif in K1 endosialidase may reflect a more general interaction between a patch of basic side chains with an unbranched, polyanionic polysaccharide such as polySia (polysialic/neuraminic acid or K1 capsular polysaccharide). Removal of the autochaperone through proteolytic maturation raises questions regarding the significance and role of this motif, it is conceivable that the cleaved fragment remains phage-associated under normal conditions of phage assembly to enhance host recognition. However, evidence from cryoelectron microscopy (58) indicates that the autochaperone domain does not remain associated with mature KflA or K1E endosialidase.The morphology of ϕK1–5 and ϕK1E was recently studied by cryoelectron microscopy (58). A comparison of the density maps enabled identification of the electron density contribution by K5 lyase, as this enzyme is absent from ϕK1E. The authors showed the P22 TSP structure fitted the density map of K5 lyase. Six symmetrically related copies of the KflA trimer were fitted into the 6-fold averaged electron density map for the K1–5 tail using the fitting function within the UCSF Chimera package (Fig. 2, a and b) (66). This procedure used a simulated map generated from the KflA structures at 24-Å resolution, corresponding to the estimated resolution of the density map for the K1–5 tail (58), and gave a correlation coefficient of 0.77. Interaction between neighboring tail spikes occurs through the β-barrel domain of K1 endosialidase (Fig. 2a). The partners in this interaction are attached to different molecules of adapter protein (gp37), thereby creating an unbroken ring of interacting TSPs around the base of the bacteriophage, which may contribute to stability and correct orientation of tail spikes (Fig. 2b).Assembly of KflA within the cryo-electron microscopy density map of the tail spike region of K1–5. Ribbon plots of KflA (green) and K1F endosialidase (Protein Data Bank code 1v0F; red) are shown superimposed onto a mesh of the K1–5 tail spike density map (58). a, detail of the contact between KflA and K1F endosialidase trimers; the endosialidase β-barrel domain is indicated. b, arrangement of KflA and K1F endosialidase trimers within the 6-fold symmetric structure of the K1–5 tail spike, superimposed on the semitransparent map of the cryo-electron microscopy density map. KflA and K1F endosialidase were fitted into the density map (accession no. 1335 from the Macromolecular Structure database at the European Bioinformatics Institute), and the figure was generated using the UCSF Chimera package (66).All of the glycosyl moieties in K5 polysaccharide have been shown by NMR to be in the 4C1 chair configuration (59). The β-elimination at GlcA requires abstraction of the axial proton at C5 and breaking of the equatorial glycosidic bond attached to C4. This mechanism is a syn-β-elimination (both leaving groups on the same face of the incipient unsaturated bond) (60). Hyaluronan lyases, chondroitin AC lyases, and heparinase III also catalyze syn-β-elimination reactions, but none of these have a catalytic single-stranded β-helix. Despite being a glycosaminoglycan lyase and having the same overall fold as KflA, chondroitinase B catalyzes an anti-β-elimination at IdoA moieties of dermatan sulfate; this requires a different spatial arrangement of catalytic side chains to that required for syn-β-elimination. Heparinase I and pectic lyases also catalyze anti-β-elimination reactions. Heparinase II has two overlapping catalytic side chain groupings, which can catalyze anti- or syn-β-elimination at IdoA or GlcA components, respectively, in suitable substrates (13). Comparison of KflA residues Glu206 and Lys208, implicated by the mutational analysis to be involved in the catalytic mechanism, with the proposed catalytic residues of other polysaccharide lyases revealed similarity to the active site proposed for heparinase II in syn-β-elimination at GlcA substituents of heparan sulfate. This is essentially the same reaction as that catalyzed by KflA, differing only in the degree of modification of neighboring glycosyl units tolerated by the two enzymes. Despite the overall structure of the catalytic domain of heparinase II (α/α-toroidal) being very different to that of KflA, the two active sites show similar spatial arrangement when superimposed (Fig. 3). Convergence has been noted before between Pel10A, an (α/α)3-barrel pectate lyase, and Pel1C, a parallel β-helix pectate lyase (60), which catalyze anti-β-elimination. The mechanism proposed for heparinase II (13) involves hydrogen-bond formation between the carboxylic group of GlcA and that of Glu205. Tyr257 is proposed to act as a “base” to abstract the proton at C5 of GlcA. Tyr257 also is proposed to act as an “acid,” donating a proton to the proximal glycosidic oxygen, breaking the linkage between C1 of GlcNAc and C4 of GlcA. This dual action of catalytic Tyr residues also has been suggested for other syn-β-eliminases (8).Overlay of active site residues from KflA and heparinase II. KflA residues are shown in blue, and heparinase II residues are shown in red (Protein Data Bank code 2FUT). The heparin disaccharide ligand from heparinase II is also shown.The mechanism proposed here for KflA involves hydrogen bond formation between the protonated carboxylic group of Glu206 and the carboxylate of GlcA. This dissipates the negative charge on this group, allowing proton abstraction at C5 of GlcA by Lys208. Lys208 also is proposed to donate a proton to the oxygen of the glycosidic linkage terminating at C4 of GlcA. The order in which reactions at Lys208 occur (and at Tyr257 of heparinase II) has not been determined.The products of this reaction on a K5 polysaccharide molecule are two shorter chains, one with GlcNAc at the new reducing end and another with Δ-4,5-unsaturated GlcA (4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid) at the nonreducing end. During initial stages of the in vitro assay, reaction products are noninhibitory, as they are cleavable substrates for KflA.Other mechanisms proposed for lyases to neutralize the negative charge on substrate hexuronate residues include charge dissipation through hydrogen bond formation to Asn side chains as found in hyaluronan lyase (45) and chondroitin AC lyase (8), interaction with Arg side chains as found in pectin lyases A and B (61, 62) or with coordinated Ca2+ ions as found in pectate lyase C (63) and chondroitinase B (17). KflA does not require metal ions for function (28), and no such cofactor was observed in the crystal structure, leading us to conclude the catalytic role of Glu206 is not the coordination of a metal cofactor. Rather, we propose Glu206 is involved in direct hydrogen bond formation with the carboxylic group of GlcA substrate components in a role analogous to that of Glu205 in the syn-β-elimination catalytic site of heparinase II.This phenomenon has been reported previously in the case of ϕK1–5, which can infect and replicate in E. coli K1 and K5 strains (3). Coliphage K1–5 has both K1 endosialidase and K5 lyase tail spikes, each attached to the virion through interaction of the N-terminal domain with separate attachment sites on the gp37 adapter protein (Fig. 2, a and b) (58). Coliphage K5A has been observed previously to infect E. coli K95 strains and degrade K95 polysaccharide (64, 65), frequently leading to mistyping of K95 strains as K5. Located 3′ to kflA in the genome of ϕK5A is open reading frame523 which likely encodes a K95-specific TSP (3). We have confirmed plaque formation in lawns of E. coli K95 by ϕK5A (data not shown). Therefore, ϕK5A may more accurately be named ϕK5–95. Dual-specificity has obvious implications for phage evolution and expansion of host range as has been discussed previously (3).In conclusion, the structure of K5 lyase A reported in this paper represents the first viral tail spike protein to combine a single-stranded β-helix fold with a β-eliminase catalytic mechanism, an enzyme activity common among bacterial glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes. Also, the proposed catalytic mechanism involves an unusual role of Glu206 in direct hydrogen bonding to the carboxylate group within the substrate, mimicking the catalytic role of Glu205 in heparinase II.We thank Dr. Tom Jowitt and Marj Howard (Biomolecular facility, Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester) for light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses and Dr. Jim Warwicker (Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester) for assistance with pKa predictions and interpretation.*This work was supported by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) of the United Kingdom.The atomic coordinates and structure factors (code 2X3H) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (http://www.rcsb.org/).The atomic coordinates and structure factors (code 2X3H) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (http://www.rcsb.org/).The on-line version of this article (available at http://www.jbc.org) contains supplemental Figs.

PMC2911477,The molecular basis of glycogen breakdown and transport in Streptococcus pneumoniae,False,"The genome of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, as typified by the TIGR4 strain, contains several genes encoding proteins putatively involved in α-glucan degradation, modification and synthesis. The extracellular components comprise an ABC-transporter with its solute-binding protein, MalX, and the hydrolytic enzyme SpuA. We show that of the commonly occurring exogenous α-glucans, S. pneumoniae TIGR4 is only able to grow on glycogen in a MalX and SpuA-dependent manner. SpuA is able to degrade glycogen into a ladder of α-1,4-glucooligosaccharides while the high affinity interaction (Ka ~ 106 M−1) of MalX with maltooligosaccharides plays a key role in promoting the selective uptake of the glycogen degradation products that are produced by SpuA. The X-ray crystallographic analyses of apo- and complexed MalX illuminate the protein’s specificity for the degradation products of glycogen and its striking ability to recognize the helical structure of the ligand. Overall, the results of this work provide new structural and functional insight into streptococcal α-glucan metabolism while supplying biochemical support for the hypothesis that the substrate of the S. pneumoniae α-glucan metabolizing machinery is glycogen, which in a human host is abundant lung epithelial cells, a common target for invasive S. pneumoniae.Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterium that frequently asymptomatically colonizes the nasopharynx of humans. Given the appropriate circumstances, however, this bacterium can become an aggressive pathogen causing a wide variety of diseases including serious invasive infections such as pneumonia and meningitis (Kadioglu & Andrew, 2004). The frequency and severity of S. pneumoniae infections have made it the subject of intense studies aimed at identifying bacterial and host factors that contribute to the prowess of this organism as a pathogen. Several studies, including large-scale signature tagged mutagenesis experiments (Hava & Camilli, 2002, Chen et al., 2007, Polissi et al., 1998, Lau et al., 2001), have revealed a large number of virulence factors, which, surprisingly, have known or predicted roles in carbohydrate metabolism. Among the known ones are the neuraminidases and hyaluronate lyase, which have been well-studied (Jedrzejas, 2007); however, the vast majority of these streptococcal carbohydrate-active virulence factors remain unexamined.Among the emerging streptococcal virulence factors involved in carbohydrate metabolism are a group of proteins that are putatively involved in α-glucan degradation and synthesis. α-glucans are a group of polysaccharides, for example starch (a composite of amylose and amylopectin) and glycogen, that are defined by their predominant composition of α-linked glucose. Examination of the S. pneumoniae genome, which contains up to 11 genes encoding proteins involved in the breakdown and/or biosynthesis of α-glucans and an additional 5 genes encoding regulatory and transport proteins related to these metabolic functions, indicates the capacity for this bacterium to sense, respond to and metabolize α-glucans (Table 1). Six of these genes have been identified by signature-tagged mutagenesis to be necessary for the full virulence of S. pneumoniae (Hava & Camilli, 2002) (Table 1). The importance of α-glucan utilization pathways to bacterial virulence is somewhat surprising considering that the evolutionary retention of α-glucan metabolizing machinery has been linked to a “free-living” bacterial lifestyle, rather than one of commensalism and/or pathogenesis (Henrissat et al., 2002). Recent studies of α-glucan utilization in S. pyogenes (group A streptococcus or GAS) is beginning to provide insight into this apparent inconsistency. Microarray analysis of the S. pyogenes transcriptome has indicated that α-glucan utilization occurs in deep infections of soft tissue (Graham et al., 2006). Subsequent studies have specifically shown that the maltooligosaccharide specific solute-binding protein, MalE, and maltose/maltotriose specific phosphotransferase system, MalT, enable colonization of the oropharynx through their niche-specific role in the utilization of dietary starch (Shelburne et al., 2007, Shelburne et al., 2008, Shelburne et al., 2006). More strikingly, a recent study has shown that a GAS cyclodextrin glucanotransferase produces extracellular cyclodextrins from exogenous starch, which facilitates host epithelial cell invasion by a process that does not appear to be linked to energy liberation(Shelburne et al., 2009). Despite these advances, beyond an appreciation of the genes in the pneumococcal genome that encode proteins putatively involved in α-glucan metabolism, few details have been confirmed regarding the metabolism of this class of polysaccharide by S. pneumoniae and even less is understood about the apparent involvement of this metabolic process in pneumococcal virulence.Proteins encoded by the Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 genome that are putatively involved in α-glucan metabolism.Among the six putative pneumococcal virulence factors suggested to be involved in α-glucan degradation are SpuA, a cell-wall attached protein classified as a pullulanase, and MalX, the lipid-anchored solute-binding protein (SBP) of a maltooligosaccharide specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. MalX and SpuA are particularly notable as they are the only extracellular components of the predicted pneumococcal α-glucan metabolism machinery, suggesting their importance in exogenous α-glucan metabolism (Table 1). The genetic structure of S. pneumoniae’s maltodextrin utilization operon was described quite some time ago when it was found through genetic means that MalX was required for the bacterium’s growth on maltotetraose (Puyet & Espinosa, 1993) (Figure 1); however, this was not considered in the context of polysaccharide metabolism. SpuA (S. pneumoniae
pullulanase A) was more recently identified through screening a genome-based library against convalescent-phase human serum and confirmed as being an immunogenic cell-surface attached protein with activity on the bacterial α-glucan pullulan (Bongaerts et al., 2000). Though the α-glucanase activity of SpuA was conclusively demonstrated, pullulan is a biologically rare polysaccharide thus leaving the biological substrate of SpuA unknown. Towards identifying a biologically relevant substrate for SpuA, we recently dissected the modular architecture of SpuA’s 1280 amino acids to reveal a complex multimodular structure, which includes two family 41 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) at its N-terminus, and a family 13 glycoside hydrolase catalytic module at its C-terminus (van Bueren et al., 2007, Boraston et al., 2004, Stam et al., 2006)(Figure 1). Significantly, the CBMs were demonstrated bind to glycogen stores in type II alveolar lung cells leading to our prediction that exogenous glycogen, possibly that in lung cells, is a relevant and viable target for S. pneumoniae’s α-glucan metabolising machinery (van Bueren et al., 2007). Should this be the case, the extracellular localization of SpuA and MalX leads to the expansion of this hypothesis to suggest that these two proteins will work in concert and be critical to the depolymerization of exogenous glycogen and the transport its breakdown products. In this work we provide compelling support for these hypotheses through functional analyses of purified recombinant SpuA and MalX, demonstration of their role in S. pneumoniae’s growth on glycogen, and the X-ray crystallographic analysis of the structure of MalX.Organization of the Mal operon (A) and the modular structure of SpuA (B). Large arrows represent genes and their direction of transcription in the Mal operon (B). Small arrows indicate the promoters and their directionality. The modules of SpuA are labelled indicating unknown modules (UNK), the family 41 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM41-1 and CBM41-2), a linker module, and the N-, C-, and (α/β)8-barrel of the catalytic domain. The construct used for the work in this study is shown immediately below the full-length schematic.The qualitative analysis of SpuA’s activity on pullulan, a linear α-glucan comprising maltotriose (three α-1,4-glucose residues) units joined by α-1,6-glycosidic linkages, led to the postulation that this protein is active on the α-1,6-linkages in this polysaccharide (Bongaerts et al., 2000). More recently, the related pullulanase from S. agalactiae, SAP, was demonstrated to degrade pullulan into maltotriose by hydrolysis of the α-1,6-linkages (Santi et al., 2008). SAP was also able to depolymerize glycogen into an uncharacterized population of oligosaccharides. To better examine α-glucan degradation by SpuA we cloned and overexpressed a gene fragment encoding the two N-terminal CBMs, the linker module, and the catalytic module of SpuA (see Figure 1), and purified the protein product. Like SAP, SpuA hydrolyzed pullulan to generate a sugar product with a fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) mobility (Figure 2A) and thin layer chromatography mobility (not shown) most consistent with maltotriose. No activity on dextran, a pure polymer of α-1,6-linked glucose, could be detected (not shown). Together, these results are consistent with selectivity for α-1,6-linkages but only in the context of stretches of α-1,4-linked glucoses. Pullulan, however, is a relatively rare fungal polysaccharide making it an unlikely biological substrate for streptococcal pullulanases. Thus, we examined the product profile of SpuA treated glycogen, a more relevant substrate as it is a common storage polysaccharide in many organisms including humans, by FACE and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD), both of which showed the generation of an array of gluco-oligosaccharides having degrees of polymerization (DP) ranging from one (glucose) to over thirty (Figure 2B and C). Furthermore, the electrophoretic mobilities (FACE) and elution positions (HPAEC) of the low molecular weight oligosaccharides produced by the SpuA-catalyzed degradation of glycogen matched those of pure α-1,4-glucooligosaccharide standards with degrees of polymerization (DP) from 2 (maltose) to 8 (maltooctaose)(Figure 2B and C). No evidence of products containing α-1,6-linkages, which did show distinctive properties by HPAEC, could be detected. Given that glycogen comprises α-1,4-linked glucose chains with α-1,6-linked branches of these chains occurring every 8–12 glucose residues, this hydrolysis pattern is again most consistent with the SpuA-catalyzed hydrolysis of α-1,6-glycosidic linkages at the glycogen branch points.Product profiles of pullulan and glycogen hydrolyzed by SpuA. A) FACE analysis of product produced by SpuA treatment of pullulan. The lanes are as follows: 1, maltooligosaccharide standards (M2–M6 indicate maltose to maltohexaose, inclusively); 2 and 3, SpuA treated pullulan; 4, untreated pullulan. B) FACE analysis of product produced by SpuA treatment of glycogen. The lanes are as follows: 1, maltooligosaccharide standards; 2 untreated glycogen; and 3, SpuA treated glycogen. C) HPAEC-PAD analysis of glycogen treated by SpuA. The upper trace shows a mixture of sugar standards - the unique elution positions of the sugars were first determined by analysis of the individual sugars. The peak labels are as follows: G, glucose; I2, isomaltose; I3, isomaltotriose; M2-M8, maltose to maltooctaose; P, panose; and GM3M3; 63-α-D-glucosyl-maltotriosyl-maltotriose. The lower trace shows the product profile of SpuA treated glycogen. Untreated glycogen (not shown) showed only a peak corresponding to the small peak indicated in the lower trace of panel C by an asterisk (*). The peaks are labelled as in the upper trace according to the deduced identity of the sugars.Though the genetic analysis of the pneumococcal maltodextrin utilization operon revealed the importance of MalX in maltodextrin utilization the direct interaction of this protein with sugars has not been demonstrated. To facilitate analysis of MalX the gene fragment encoding a soluble form of the protein was expressed in E. coli and the overproduced protein purified. The interaction of MalX with maltooligosaccharides was quantified by both UV difference binding analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry (Figure 3, Table 2). Initial UV difference scans revealed a complex UV difference profile comprising at least four peaks, consistent with a composite spectrum resulting from the involvement of both tryptophan residues and tyrosine residues in carbohydrate recognition by this protein (Boraston et al., 2001)(Figure 3A). Both methods gave experimental stoichiometries consistent with 1:1 binding and revealed relatively high-affinity interactions in the 1 × 105–106 M−1 range for linear oligosaccharides increasing in size from maltotriose to maltooctaose, all of which is in agreement with other maltodextrin binding proteins (Shelburne et al., 2007, Thomson et al., 1998)(Table 2). The protein’s affinity for maltose, which could only be approximated by UV difference due to very weak binding, was approximately 3 orders of magnitude weaker than for maltotriose. The very weak affinity of MalX for maltose suggests that this protein would not able to facilitate the transport this disaccharide. For linear maltooligosacchardes larger than maltose, the association constants were very similar with only a roughly 2-fold difference observed between the highest and lowest affinities. MalX also had a very low affinity for maltotetraitol, which contains a linearized and oxidized reducing end sugar, indicating that MalX is selective for maltooligosaccharides with an intact reducing end.Representative binding experiments showing the interaction MalX with maltotriose. A) The UV difference spectrum induced by the binding of maltotriose to MalX. Peaks and troughs in the spectrum are labelled. B) A representative isotherm of maltotriose to MalX produced by a UV difference titration. Each curve corresponds to a different peak-to-trough wavelength pair used to measure the change in UV absorbance upon ligand binding: circles, 287.1–282.7 nm pair; and squares, 295.3–290.0 nm pair. Solid lines show the fits to a one-site binding model accounting for ligand depletion. C) Representative isothermal titration calorimetry titration for maltotriose. The upper panel shows the unintegrated data corrected for baseline. The lower panel shows the integrated heats fit to a one-site binding model.Quantitative analysis of MalX binding toα-glucooligosaccharides.ND, not determined.The poor binding to maltose but maximal affinity for maltotriose suggests the presence of three major subsites within the binding site of MalX that accommodate the three sugar units of the reducing end of the oligosaccharide. A comparison of the energetic components reveals there is a slight general trend of decreasing enthalpies with small favourable entropic compensations as the oligosaccharide length increases resulting in small overall changes in the free energy. This thermodynamic signature closely resembles that reported for S. pyogenes MalE (Shelburne et al., 2007) and shows that in the longer ligands sugar subunits positioned towards the non-reducing end do not contribute significantly to the binding energy. The binding of linear maltooligosaccharides to E. coli MalE had more variability for the same range with but maltotriose still displaying the strongest interaction (Quiocho et al., 1997).The biochemical properties of SpuA and MalX in isolation are therefore consistent with their respective hypothesized functions in the depolymerization of glycogen and transport of the degradation products. At present, however, it is unknown if S. pneumoniae can catabolize glycogen or whether SpuA and MalX participate in this. Towards addressing these questions we initially assessed the ability of S. pneumoniae to grow in liquid culture on various highly polymerized α-glucans. As expected, S. pneumoniae grew well on control substrates, glucose and maltotriose, but virtually not at all in the absence of a carbohydrate source (Figure 4A). No growth was observed on components of starch: amylopectin (Figure 4A) and amylose (not shown, results identical to amylopectin). Significant growth was found on glycogen, though reduced in comparison to glucose, but surprisingly little growth was observed with pullulan as a substrate (Figure 4A). To determine the importance of SpuA and MalX to growth on glycogen, Δspua and Δmalx strains were created by replacing the respective genes in S. pneumoniae TIGR4 with a chlorampenicol resistance cassette. These strains grew readily on glucose and maltotriose but neither were able to grow on glycogen (Figure 4C and D). The addition of purified recombinant SpuA to the culture improved the ability of wild-type to grow on glycogen and restored the ability of the Δspua strain to grow on glycogen to a similar level as wild-type with added SpuA (Figure 4B and D). Thus, the α-glucan degrading machinery of S. pneumoniae is clearly selective for glycogen with SpuA and MalX having critical importance in the metabolism of this polysaccharide when it is supplied as an exogenous substrate.Growth of S. pneumoniae (TIGR4) on α-glucans. A) Growth of wild-type on various α-glucans. B) Growth of wild-type on glycogen. C) Growth of the Δmalx strain. D) Growth of the Δspua strain. In all panels, the symbol type represents different growth substrates: closed squares - glucose; open squares - glycogen; closed circles - no substrate; open circles - maltotriose; closed triangles - glycogen with added recombinant SpuA; open triangles - pullulan; open diamonds - amylopectin. In panels C and D the glycogen and no substrate curves overlap. Error bars represent the standard deviations measurements made from growth cultures performed in triplicate. Where error bars are not visible the error was within the size of the symbol.The activity of SpuA, likely on the α-1,6-branch points of glycogen, results in a population of maltooligosaccharides with a wide array of sizes raising the question of whether all of these oligosaccharides or only a sub-population could be utilized by the bacterium. We addressed this question by the HPAEC-PAD analyses of the residual α-glucans remaining in the culture supernatants of the pneumococcus when grown on glycogen. Wild-type S. pneumoniae TIGR4 cultures grown with glycogen contained an array of α-glucooligosaccharides whose degrees of polymerization (DP), but not relative abundance, were consistent with the in vitro depolymerization of glycogen by purified SpuA (Figure 5A). The majority of the α-glucooligosaccharides were larger than eight sugar units in length with only small amounts of shorter oligosaccharides identified by their elution positions as maltohexaose, maltoheptaose, and maltooctaose (Figure 5A). As expected, the Δspua strain showed no soluble α-glucooligosaccharides in the culture supernatant (Figure 5A). Though it did not grow well on glycogen the Δmalx strain was still clearly able to depolymerize glycogen to some extent resulting in α-glucooligosaccharides increasing in size from maltotetraose to maltooctaose (identified by their elution position) and larger oligosaccharides (Figure 5A). In contrast to the wild-type cultures, the most abundant α-glucooligosaccharides produced by the Δmalx strain were maltopentaose, maltohexaose, and maltoheptaose. The differences in the relative abundances of residual α-glucooligosaccharides observed for the Δmalx and wild-type strains, as judged by peak areas, indicated that the wild-type strain is effective at almost completely depleting α-glucooligosaccharides up to eight glucose units in length (Figure 5A). Oligosaccharides of 9-11 glucose units in length were only partially depleted while the bacterium appeared to have little to no ability to deplete oligosaccharides longer than 11 glucose units in length.Analysis of maltooligosaccharides in the culture supernatants of S. pneumoniae grown in the presence of glycogen. A) Upper trace, oligosaccharides present in the culture supernatant of wild-type S. pneumoniae TIGR4 grown in ACGHY media with glycogen; middle trace, oligosaccharides present in the culture supernatant of the Δspua strain grown in the same medium; lower trace, oligosaccharides present in the culture supernatant of the Δmalx strain. B) Upper trace, ACGHY media containing glycogen, supplemented with recombinant SpuA (indicated as rSpuA) and incubated as for other cultures but not inoculated with bacteria. Second trace, oligosaccharides present in the culture supernatant of wild-type S. pneumoniae TIGR4 grown in ACGHY media with glycogen and supplemented with recombinant SpuA. Third trace, oligosaccharides present in the culture supernatant of Δspua grown in ACGHY media with glycogen and supplemented with recombinant SpuA. Lower trace, oligosaccharides present in the culture supernatant of the Δmalx strain grown in ACGHY media with glycogen and supplemented with recombinant SpuA. In all panels, oligosaccharide identities for maltooligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization from 2 to 8 were determined from comparison to known standards; these are labelled M2-M8. Oligosaccharides M9-M28 are inferred to be α-1,4-glucooligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization from 9 to 28.To enhance our ability to observe the depletion of glucooligosaccharides from the culture we supplemented cultures with purified recombinant SpuA to enhance glycogen degradation. In all cases, glycogen was effectively depolymerized and yielded roughly 10-times more oligosaccharide, as approximated by HPAEC-PAD signal, than in the absence of exogenous SpuA (Figure 5B). Bacteria-free media samples containing glycogen with added recombinant SpuA yielded a pattern of oligosaccharide production identical to the in vitro activity of purified recombinant SpuA. Relative to the bacteria-free sample and the Δmalx culture, the wild-type strain and the Δspua strain, whose glycogen degrading capacity was restored by the exogenous addition of SpuA, completely depleted the culture of oligosaccharides smaller than nine glucose units in length and partially depleted those from ~9-11 glucose residues. This is consistent with the results observed without the exogenous addition of SpuA.Curiously, the Δmalx strain was still able to grow effectively on maltotriose and its growth on glycogen was partially restored by the addition of exogenous purified SpuA (Figure 4C). Given that the mutant Δmalx strain is clearly compromised in its ability to transport α-glucooligosaccharides, the improved growth of this strain in the presence of added SpuA and its ability to grow on maltotriose was somewhat surprising. An explanation is suggested by the comparison of the pattern of glucooligosaccharides generated by purified recombinant SpuA in the absence of bacteria and in the presence of the Δmalx strain; the Δmalx strain appears to retain the capacity to deplete the culture supernatant of maltose and maltotriose, sugars that are produced in some abundance in media containing purified recombinant SpuA (Figure 5B). This is consistent with our observation that the Δmalx strain grew comparably to wild-type on maltotriose and suggests the presence of a second system that transports α-glucooligosaccharides smaller than maltotetraose. Indeed, a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transporter system (PTS) performing exactly this function, MalT, has recently been identified in S. pyogenes (Shelburne et al., 2008). The genome of S. pneumoniae TIGR4 encodes a putative protein (locus tag SP_0758) with 70% amino acid sequence identity to MalT. Based on this similarity, we postulate SP_0758 to participate in maltose and maltotriose transport in S. pneumoniae and thus compensate for the low affinity of MalX for maltose. This hypothesis is given conceptual support by the S. pyogenes system (Shelburne et al., 2008) and also the presence of a similar maltose/maltodextrin transport system in Bacillus subtilis that incorporates a homologous PTS transporter specific for maltose and maltotriose while an ABC-transporter with a maltodextrin binding protein is specific for maltotriose and longer maltodextrins (Schonert et al., 2006).S. pneumoniae is apparently unable to grow on amylopectin or amylose, which collectively comprise starch, indicating the bacterium’s inability to utilize exogenous α-glucans that are primarily composed of α-1,4-linked glucose. This is consistent with its lack of a predicted extracellular α-1,4-glucanase. S. pneumoniae is, however, clearly able to utilize exogenous glycogen as an energy source in a manner that is absolutely dependent upon the SpuA-catalyzed hydrolysis of α-1,6-branch points in this polysaccharide. By hydrolysis of this substrate, which has branch points on average every 8–12 glucose units, SpuA generates a relatively large amount of smaller maltodextrins. A subset of these maltodextins, DP 3–8, are apparently optimal ligands for MalX while those with DP 9-11 appear to be less optimal. Though amylopectin also has α-1,6-branches, these occur only roughly every 24–30 glucose residues, which would give SpuA hydrolysis products of a high DP that would not be ligands for MalX. Thus, SpuA’s specificity and MalX’s selectivity appear to create a system tailored for glycogen metabolism.ABC-transporters, particularly the E. coli maltodextrin transporter as a model for carbohydrate specific transporters, are well understood (Oldham et al., 2007, Procko et al., 2009). On the strength of this knowledge, it should be noted that MalX possess a biological function that is dependently linked to other components of an archetypal ABC-transporter. Because MalX resides in a three gene operon where it is upstream of the two genes encoding the permease components of the ABC-transporter (Figure 1), we cannot formally rule out the possibility of a polar effect from replacement of the malx gene, which disrupts expression of the permease genes and thus contributes to the phenotype of the Δmalx strain. However, in light of a full understanding that MalX must function in vivo as part of a multicomponent complex whose activity is dependent upon its complete assembly and cooperativity of the parts, the influence of possible polar effects becomes unimportant. That is, from the perspective of maltooligosaccharide uptake, polar and non-polar mutations in the ABC-transporter components would appear phenotypically identical, thus any gene replacement in the transporter operon would probe overall transporter function rather than individual component function. Along similar lines it might be argued that the selectivity of the transporter may actually be determined by the permease components. We find this unlikely on two bases. First, permease-dependent selectivity would result in the default possibility that MalX could form complexes with tight-binding but non-transportable substrates (e.g. very long maltooligosaccharides), which would be extremely inefficient as this would effectively clog the system. Second, and likely related to the first, because, where substrate-binding proteins are employed, they initiate transport by substrate recognition and delivery of the substrate to the permease and thus are generally recognized as both critical to function and as specificity-determining components of ABC-transporters (Davidson et al., 2008). Nevertheless, to provide additional evidence of MalX’s maltooligosaccharide binding specificity to further support our contention that MalX defines the observed selective uptake of glycogen-derived maltooligosaccharides, we pursued structural studies of this protein.MalX was crystallized in complex with maltoheptaose and its crystal structure determined by X-ray diffraction to 2.0 Å resolution. The protein displays a conventional α/β Type II solute binding protein fold with the two globular domains separated by a hinge region that criss-crosses between them at three distinct positions (147–150, 288–301, and 371–377) (Figure 6A). The ligand in the maltoheptaose complexed protein was identified by unambiguous electron density for seven glucose subunits in the MalX binding site, which allowed this sugar to be confidently modeled (Figure 6B). The maltoheptaose ligand adopts a signature conformation corresponding to a full turn of a left-handed α-helix. Each monosaccharide constituent adopts its favourable 4C1 pyranosyl conformation with α-1,4 linkages displaying an average glycosidic bond angle of 111.7° ± 0.8. The torsional constraints of the helix, which have an average ϕ angle of −124.3° and ψ angle of 104.6°, within the binding site are similar to that observed for numerous other non-catalytic maltooligosaccharide binding proteins that have open binding sites (Koropatkin et al., 2008, Quiocho et al., 1997, Tonozuka et al., 2007). This suggests that the engulfing of the ligand by MalX does not impose significant constraints on the conformation of the α-glucan chain.The three-dimensional structure of MalX in complex with maltohepatose at 2.0 Å resolution. A) MalX is shown from a side projection in a ribbon format with the small N-terminal domain colored purple and the large C-terminal domain colored blue. The solvent accessible surface is shown in transparent grey and maltohepatose is shown as green sticks. The approximate angle of the entry for the sugar is indicated. B) Electron density of maltohepatose shown as a maximum-likelihood (Murshudov et al., 1997)/σa-weighted (Read, 1986) 2Fobs-Fcalc electron density map contoured at 1.0 σ (0.28e−/Å3). C) Direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds within the binding site of MalX. Side chains are represented as grey sticks, maltoheptaose as green sticks, and waters as red spheres. The binding subsites are labelled. D) Solvent accessible surface representation of the binding site. Putative hydrophobic interactions, including the three “stacking” interactions and a leucine “pin,” are shaded in magenta. The ligand subsites are numbered as in (C).When the protein is viewed from the side projection maltoheptaose enters the binding site on a ~30° angle to the horizontal plane of the protein (Figure 6A). The oligosaccharide is pinned in the binding site by a leucine residue that protrudes from the base of the MalX binding site and pierces the ring of the ligand in a manner much like that observed for the carbohydrate-binding module from rat AMP-activated protein kinase (Polekhina et al., 2005). This trapped form of the protein reveals the presence of at least seven subsites in which extensive direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds are made between the protein and sugar (Figure 6C), as well as classic the protein-carbohydrate interaction whereby aromatic amino acid side-chains pack in a parallel fashion against the pyranose rings of the sugar ligand (Figure 6D). The core binding site is defined by the first three subsites characterized by the presence of three aromatic amino acid side chains, which are structurally conserved in all described maltodextrin-binding proteins (Quiocho et al., 1997, Tonozuka et al., 2007). In MalX these are Tyr197 (subsite 2), which is flanked by two tryptophans, Trp273 (subsite 1) and Trp384 (subsite 3) (Figure 6D). These residues, whose observed interaction with ligand are consistent with the complex composite UV difference spectra, are all present on the large C-terminal domain and form the “aromatic cradle” that has been reported for several other unrelated α-glucan binding protein families (Boraston et al., 2006, Koropatkin et al., 2008, Lammerts van Bueren et al., 2004, Lammerts van Bueren et al., 2007). This concave surface beautifully complements the unique dimensions of curved surface of the twisting maltooligosaccharide helix, providing selectivity in ligand recognition.Of the core binding site, subsite 1 appears to be particularly important with Lys306 Nζ and Tyr51 Oη making several direct hydrogen bonds with the O2 and O3 of the glucose residue bound in this subsite (Figure 6C). Because the architecture of this subsite legislates against recognition of the non-reducing end due to steric clashes with the C6-hydroxymethyl group of a non-reducing terminal sugar, this provides the protein with specificity for the reducing end of maltooligosaccharides. However, MalX’s low affinity for maltose indicate that subsites 1 and 2 provide less than one-half of the change in binding free-energy whereas subsite 3, as suggested by the protein’s maximal affinity for maltotriose, provides the majority of the binding energy. Thus, together, subsites 1-3 contribute the selectivity for the reducing end of the sugar, specificity for the curved conformation of the ligand, and the energy that drives the interaction. In contrast, though subsites 4-7 in MalX provide some hydrogen bonds to the ligand, they do not significantly contribute to the binding energy of the interaction, as indicated by the similar affinities of MalX for maltooligosaccharides ranging in size from maltotetroase to maltoheptaose.This ligand-stabilized “closed” conformation of MalX displays closest structural similarity to the B chain of Thermotoga maritima maltotriose-binding protein in complex with maltotriose (2GHA chain B, rms = 1.8 Å for 360 aligned Cα) (unpublished), the Thermoactinomyces vulgaris MBP in complex with β-cyclodextrin (2ZYK, Chain D, Z-value = 44.9, rmsd = 1.8 Å for 361 Cα) (Tonozuka et al., 2007) and the E. coli MBP in complex with maltotriose (3MBP, Z-value = 42.3, rmsd = 2.2 Å for 353 aligned Cα(Quiocho et al., 1997), though there is still significant structural similarity with other maltodextrin-binding proteins (Cuneo et al., 2006, Diez et al., 2001). In keeping with this structural identity, the spatial positioning of subsites 1-4 in MalX are generally conserved with the four core subsites described for other maltodextrin-binding proteins, except the E. coli maltodextrin-binding protein, which lacks subsite 1 (Cuneo et al., 2009). This difference in the presence of subsite 1 may be origin of MalX’s inability to bind maltotetraitol whereas the E. coli maltodextrin binding protein appears able to accommodate this reduced sugar (Duan et al., 2001). Though the structure of MalX was determined in complex with a longer linear maltooligosaccharide than any other maltodextrin-binding protein determined to date, its binding site is only approximately 4–6 Å wider than other maltodextrin-binding proteins determined in complex with maltotriose or maltotetraose. This appears consistent, however, with the approximation that each glucose residue in an maltooligosaccharide extends the linear length of the sugar by ~5.5 Å but only increases the depth of its helical structure by ~1.5 Å. Thus, a maltooligosaccharide that is increased in relative length by 3–4 sugars might be expected to prop open the binding site by an additional 4.5–6 Å, as we observed. This hints at the structural changes that would be required by this class of proteins to accommodate ligands of varying size.The ligand bound structure of MalX shows the maltoheptaose molecule to be neatly sequestered in its binding site with both ends of the saccharide engaging the end-walls of the binding site (figure 6A and D). While this is consistent with the protein’s high affinity for maltotriose to maltoheptaose and with the ability of S. pneumoniae to deplete these sugars from culture when grown on glycogen, it suggests that maltoheptaose represents the upper limit on the length of maltodextrin recognized by MalX. Maltooctaose, however, is clearly bound tightly by the protein and is depleted from culture, while sugars of DP 9-11 are partly depleted from the culture suggesting they must be recognized by MalX. Therefore, despite the suggestion from the MalX-maltoheptaose structure that due to steric clashes maltooctaose could not be accommodated in this conformation of the protein, MalX can clearly bind maltooligosaccharides longer than maltoheptaose. To provide insight into the conformational changes in MalX that govern ligand recognition we determined the X-ray crystal structure of MalX in its apo open form to 2.9 Å resolution. The bending at the hinge of MalX results in the binding site of the open form being roughly 6.5 Å wider than in the maltoheptaose complexed form (Figure 7A). Strikingly, the binding site of the protein maintains a shape that complements the contours of a helical maltooligosaccharide and, in particular, due to the presence of the aromatic cradle in one lobe of the protein the conformation of this key binding determinant is maintained (Figure 7A). Furthermore, a maltooligosaccharide with a DP of 12 can be fit into this binding site while maintaining the key interactions with the aromatic cradle (Figure 7B). The upper limit on the length of the oligosaccharide is imposed by the physical limits of this open binding site as the ends of longer sugar would collide with the end-walls of the binding site. Though only an approximation, this apparent structural limit approaching a sugar of 12 glucose units is quite consistent with the observed pattern of maltooligosaccharide depletion from S. pneumoniae cultures grown on glycogen. From this we propose that MalX can accommodate the size of the sugar ligand through the opening and closing of its binding site. Conceptual support for this comes from the E. coli maltodextrin-binding protein, which is known to maintain a degree of sugar binding activity even in its open conformation (Duan et al., 2001). This postulated mechanism of ligand accommodation, however, does require some shifting of the sugar in the binding site likely resulting in the loss of some specific intermolecular interactions and thus reduced binding affinity. We propose that the partial depletion of the DP 9-11 maltodextrins from the culture medium reflects a lower binding affinity for these sugars imposed by the more open conformation of MalX necessary to accommodate them while the lack of depletion of longer oligosaccharides reflects the protein’s complete inability to accomodate these sugars. The good agreement between our structural and functional data and the observed depletion pattern of glycogen-derived maltooligosaccharides from S. pneumoniae cultures argues strongly for MalX defining the selective uptake of maltooligosaccharides with a DP greater than 2 but less than 12.Structural changes and ligand accommodation in MalX. A) Overlay of MalX in the maltoheptaose complexed form (shown as a blue Cα trace) and the apo form (yellow) made by overlapping only the large C-terminal domain. The amino acids making up the aromatic binding platform are shown in stick representation and labelled. B) solvent accessible surface of the apo form of MalX with an idealized maltododecaose molecule (green sticks) modelled into the active site. The aromatic binding platform is colored purple for reference.Although S. pneumoniae does appear to have a multicomponent system for the metabolism of α-glucans, the only relevant exogenous form of α-glucan this organism is able to effectively use as an energy source is glycogen through a pathway that is schematically outlined in Figure 8. SpuA facilitates the depolymerization of glycogen through hydrolysis of its branch points, while MalX selectively transports a subset of the glycogen degradation products. SpuA and MalX are critical to the utilization of exogenous glycogen, which is consistent with their positions as the only extracellular components of S. pneumoniae’s α-glucan metabolizing machinery, though a second PTS transporter may play a less important role in the uptake of the maltose and maltotriose fractions produced from glycogen degradation. Given that S. pneumoniae appears to be an obligate commensal, one can only conclude that this pathway exists to utilize glycogen present within the host. Energy liberation to maintain bacterial growth is likely to be the primary role of glycogen utilization. While glycogen released as a result of tissue destruction is one possible source of the polysaccharide, S. pneumoniae is also a skilled invader of lung cells, which it does without necessarily destroying the cell (Kadioglu et al., 2001), making the intracellular glycogen of host cells a possible target. This suggests a second and potentially more insidious outcome of S. pneumoniae’s attack on host glycogen. It has been postulated that type II alveolar cells are a preferred target of S. pneumoniae (Cundell & Tuomanen, 1994). In these cells glycogen is a precursor for surfactant production, which is a key component of the innate immune system within the lung mucosa (Ridsdale & Post, 2004). By depleting the stores of glycogen in surfactant producing cells invading S. pneumoniae may also cripple the production of surfactant. In this light, the specific degradation of lung cell glycogen may promote infection by both supporting bacterial growth and by lowering the lungs’ defences to S. pneumoniae invasion. Further investigation into the function of virulence factors within this pathway, therefore, is paramount towards understanding the mechanisms by which glycogen is depolymerised and the implications that this has for S. pneumoniae pathogenesis and host immunity.Schematic summary of exogenous glycogen utilization in S. pneumoniae showing the degradation of glycogen (1), specific recognition and transport of the products (2–4), and processing of the internalized glycan products (5). The proteins putatively involved in processing the internalized glycans were proposed as the most likely candidates based on their predicted functions. The role of SP_0758, the MalT homolog, is putative. The putative transported products of SP_0758 are indicated as phosoph-sugars consistent with the normal function of a carbohydrate specific PTS. The yellow circles represent the nucleotide binding/ATPase component of the ABC transporter whose gene is apparently not present in the maltodextrin metabolon. Green linked hexagons represent the peptidoglycan layer to which SpuA is attached. The capsule is omitted for clarity.The DNA fragment encoding nearly full length SpuA without the N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal LPXTG motif was amplified from S. pneumoniae genomic DNA (TIGR strain BAA-334D) using the oligonucleotide primers SpuAF and SpuAR (Supplementary Table 1). The amplified DNA product encoding amino acids 135-1245 was cloned into pET28a plasmid vector via engineered 5′ NheI and 3′ XhoI restriction sites to generate pSpuA.To produce MalX in a soluble form, the malx gene was engineered to lack the secretion signal peptide and lipoprotein attachment motif. The malx gene fragment encoding amino acids 31-423 of MalX was amplified by PCR from S. pneumoniae TIGR4 genomic DNA (American Type Culture Collection BAA-334D) using the forward primer MALXF and reverse primer MALXR (Supplementary Table 1). The DNA fragments were inserted into pET 28a via engineered 5′ NheI and 3′ XhoI restriction sites to generate pMalX. Both pSpuA and pMalX encodes the protein of interest fused to an N-terminal His6-tag via a thrombin protease cleavage site.Recombinant polypeptides were produced in E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) using LB media supplemented with 50 μg ml−1 of kanamycin. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until they reached an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5–0.7 whereupon protein production was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 4 hours of additional growth at 37 °C then disrupted using a French pressure cell in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). Polypeptides were purified from the cell lysate, previously cleared by centrifugation, by immobilized metal affinity chromatography using 2 ml of Ni2+ affinity resin (GE Healthcare). Purified protein was concentrated and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, in a stirred cell ultrafiltration device with a 5000 molecular weight cut-off membrane (Millipore).The concentration of purified SpuA and MalX were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficients (Gasteiger et al., 2003) of 172930 M−1 cm−1 and 61310 M−1cm−1, respectively.TIGR4 strain (ATCC BAA-334) was used as the parental strain. S. pneumoniae was routinely cultured on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA), 6% (v/v) defibrinated sheep blood from a freezer stock stored at −80°C in Todd Hewitt with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract (THY) supplemented with 16% (v/v) glycerol. S. pneumoniae was also grown on THY broth for the transformations and a semi-defined media containing casein hydrolase, salts, vitamins, amino acids, catalase, and albumin (AGCH) with 0.2% (w/v) yeast extract (AGCHY) for the growth curves (Lacks, 1966, Chan et al., 2003). When necessary, chloramphenicol was added to 5 μg ml−1. Unless otherwise stated, S. pneumoniae was grown in a candle jar at 37 °C with no shaking.A PCR ligation technique was used to replace malX and spua with a chloramphenicol resistant cassette (Schell et al., 2002). Briefly, regions flanking the gene to be replaced and the chloramphenicol resistant cassette were amplified by PCR with primers containing specific restriction sites (see Supplementary Table 1): flanking region 1 has a 3′ NheI site, flanking region 2 has a 5′ XhoI site, and the chloramphenicol resistant cassette has both a 5′ NheI site and a 3′ XhoI site (CAM-F and CAM-R). Each amplicon was digested with the particular restriction enzyme and then all three digested amplicons used in one ligation reaction. This ligation reaction was subsequently used to transform S. pneumoniae TIGR4 creating gene replacement strains. The S. pneumoniae transformation protocol was adapted from Bricker and Camilli (Bricker & Camilli, 1999). Bacteria were grown overnight in THY broth to an approximate OD600nm of 0.7. A 1/50 dilution was then made into the pre-induction growth medium of THY, 0.5% (w/v) glycine, 11 mM HCl and grown at 37 °C in a candle jar until an OD600nm of 0.04 was reached. The media was then supplemented with 10 mM NaOH, 0.2% (w/v) BSA, 1 mM CaCl2, and 100 ng ml−1 Competence Stimulating Peptide 2 (CSP-2) in their respective order and incubated in a candle jar at 37°C for 14 minutes. At this time, the entire ligation reaction was added to the media and subsequently incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C in a candle jar. The transformation reaction was then diluted 1/4 with THY broth and incubated further for 2 hours. The transformations were finally plated on sheep blood agar supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubated overnight in a candle jar at 37 °C. Colonies were re-streaked onto new blood agar plates and the location of the chloramphenicol cassette was confirmed by several PCR analyses.The protocol for the growth curves was adapted from Battig et al. (Battig et al., 2006). Wild-type, Δmalx, and Δspua S. pneumoniae TIGR4 strains were streaked onto blood agar plates and incubated at 37 °C in a candle jar for approximately 12 hours. Overnight cultures were prepared by inoculating 10 colonies into AGCHY broth supplemented with 1% (w/v) glucose and incubated for 9–10 hours at 37°C in a candle jar. The overnight cultures were diluted 1/50 into fresh AGCHY with 1% (w/v) glucose and incubated at 37 °C in a candle jar until reaching an OD600nm of 0.5–0.6. Cells were then washed with AGCHY broth and subsequently diluted 1/50 into AGCHY with an additional 1% (w/v) of glucose, glycogen, amylose, maltotriose, pullulan, or starch, each in triplicate. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a candle jar; optical densities at 600 nm were read at regular intervals. Where appropriate, cultures were supplemented with 1 μM purified recombinant SpuA.The procedure for FACE was adapted from Jackson et. al. (Jackson, 1993). Enzyme reactions were carried out by incubating 1% (w/v) solutions of glycogen or pullulan in PBS with 30 μg of SpuA. Immediately following the reactions, 10 μl (100 μg) of polysaccharide was removed from each tube and dried in a Speedvac for 45 minutes at 50 °C. Labeling of the sugar products was carried out by adding 5μl of a solution of 0.15% ANTS in 15% acetic acid and 5μl of 1 M NaCNBH3 in DMSO to the dried samples. The reaction was incubated overnight in the dark at 37 °C then dried. The ANTS-labeled products were then resuspended in 50 μl deionized water plus 50 μl of 0.01% Thorin I loading dye (Sigma) in 20% glycerol. Approximately 1–3 μg of ANTS-labeled product were loaded onto a 28% polyacrylamide (19:1) gel with a 10% stacking gel and electrophoresed at a constant 15 mA for 105 minutes at 4°C in native running buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2M glycine) in a XCell SureLock Mini-Cell system (Invitrogen). Gels were immediately visualized and imaged under UV light.HPAEC-PAD analysis was performed using a Dionex ICS3000 instrument equipped with a CarboPac PA-200 column and pulsed amperometric detection. Samples were loaded onto the column as 20 μl volumes followed by elution with a linear gradient of sodium acetate (0–300 mM) in 100 mM sodium hydroxide over 30 minutes. Glycogen (1% w/v) was treated with SpuA as above then diluted 1000-times in sterile distilled water followed by centrifugation at 10000 × g prior to HPAEC analysis. The residual carbohydrates present in the supernatant of S. pneumoniae cultures, grown as above, were analyzed by clearing the culture of cells by centrifugation and preparing samples of the supernatant by diluting 1000-times in sterile distilled water followed by centrifugation at 10000 × g. Individual carbohydrate standards of glucose, α-1,4-glucooligosaccharides from maltose to maltooctaose, panose, isomaltose, isomaltotriose, and 63-α-D-glucosyl-maltotriosyl-maltotriose were run in 1/1000 dilutions of distilled water, PBS or AGCHY medium as appropriate and were performed on the day of each experiment. Peaks resulting from the standard sugars did not display any overlap in elution position. All resulting chromatograms were corrected for background by subtraction of the chromatogram of a 1/1000 dilution of water, PBS or AGCHY medium, with or without glycogen, run over the column. Carbohydrates were identified by comparison of the distinctive peak elution positions with those of the standards. Experiments were performed at least two times and were highly reproducible.Qualitative and quantitative UV difference binding studies were performed and analyzed as described previously using a bimolecular binding model that accounted for ligand depletion and included a term for stoichiometry (n) (Boraston et al., 2001, Lammerts van Bueren et al., 2004). UV difference titrations were performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 20 °C. The protein concentration used was 12.5 μM. When the protein concentration was 5 or more times in excess of the Kd (i.e giving C-values (Wiseman et al., 1989) greater than 5) the n was determined experimentally from the fits of the data in addition to the association constant (Ka). When this criterion was not met the n value was fixed as a constant of 1 during the data fitting. All titrations were performed in triplicate.Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed as described previously using a VP-ITC (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) (Ficko-Blean & Boraston, 2006, Abbott & Boraston, 2007). Briefly, protein samples were extensively dialyzed against buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) then concentrated in a stirred ultrafiltration cell as above. Sugar solutions were prepared by mass in buffer saved from the ultrafiltration step. Both protein and sugar solutions were filtered and degassed immediately prior to use. The protein concentration used was ~100 μM giving C-values in excess of 50. Titrations were performed in triplicate at 25 °C. The data were fit with a single binding site model to determine Ka, n, and ΔH (change in enthalpy). ΔS (change in entropy) was calculated using ΔG=ΔH−TΔS. Errors represent the standard deviations of the triplicate determinations.Prior to crystallization, MalX was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using Sephacryl-200 resin and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, as a buffer. Crystals of MalX (10 mg ml−1) in complex with maltoheptaose were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C in 1.6 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, and 10% (v/v) dioxane. MalX was crystallized in its apo form in 1.6 M sodium citrate, pH 6.5, with 3% (v/v) ethanol. Both crystals were cryoprotected by a short soak in the crystallization solution supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol and flash cooled at 113 K directly in a nitrogen stream. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS 4++ area detector coupled to a MM-002 X-ray generator with Osmic “blue” optics and an Oxford Cryostream 700. Data were processed with CrystalClear/d*trek (Pflugrath, 1999).The structure of MalX in complex with maltoheptaose was solved by molecular replacement. Using the coordinates of the T. maritima maltodextrin-binding protein in complex maltotriose (PDB code 2gha) as a search model, PHASER (Read, 2001) was able to find a clear solution for the single MalX molecule in the asymmetric unit. Two rounds of successive manual building with COOT (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004), refinement with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997), solvent flattening, and submission to ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999) ultimately produced phases sufficient for ARP/wARP to build an 80% complete model with docked sidechains. This model was corrected and completed manually using COOT and refined with REFMAC. The apo structure of MalX was solved by molecular replacement using separate N- and C-terminal lobe models derived from MalX-maltoheptaose complex as search models. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit were manually corrected using COOT and refined with REFMAC.Water molecules were added using the REFMAC implementation of COOT:FINDWATERS and inspected visually prior to deposition. Five percent of the observations were flagged as “free” and used to monitor refinement procedures (Brunger, 1992). Model validation was performed with SFCHECK (Vaguine et al., 1999) and PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). All data collection and model statistics are given in Table 3.

PMC2912727,Bioinformatics and molecular modeling in glycobiology,False,"The field of glycobiology is concerned with the study of the structure, properties, and biological functions of the family of biomolecules called carbohydrates. Bioinformatics for glycobiology is a particularly challenging field, because carbohydrates exhibit a high structural diversity and their chains are often branched. Significant improvements in experimental analytical methods over recent years have led to a tremendous increase in the amount of carbohydrate structure data generated. Consequently, the availability of databases and tools to store, retrieve and analyze these data in an efficient way is of fundamental importance to progress in glycobiology. In this review, the various graphical representations and sequence formats of carbohydrates are introduced, and an overview of newly developed databases, the latest developments in sequence alignment and data mining, and tools to support experimental glycan analysis are presented. Finally, the field of structural glycoinformatics and molecular modeling of carbohydrates, glycoproteins, and protein–carbohydrate interaction are reviewed.The field of glycobiology is concerned with the study of the structures, properties, and biological functions of the family of biomolecules called carbohydrates. These carbohydrates can differ significantly in size ranging from monosaccharides to polysaccharides consisting of many thousands of carbohydrate units. One of the most significant features of carbohydrates is their ability to form branched molecules, which stands in contrast to the linear nature of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Combined with the large heterogeneity of their basic building blocks, the monosaccharides, they exhibit a significantly higher structural diversity than other abundant macromolecules. On the cell surface, carbohydrates (glycans) occur frequently as glycoconjugates, where they are covalently attached to proteins and lipids (aglycons). Glycosylation constitutes the most prevalent of all known post-translational protein modifications. It has been estimated that more than half the proteins in nature are glycoproteins [1]. Carbohydrates (N- or O-glycans) are typically connected to proteins via asparagine (N-linked glycosylation), serine or threonine (O-linked glycosylation). In recent years, it has been shown that glycosylation plays a key role in health and disease and consequently it has gained significant attention in life science research and industry [2–10].Databases are playing a significant role in modern life science. It is now unthinkable to design research projects without a prior query or consultation of a few databases. In this respect, bioinformatics provides databases and tools to support glycobiologists in their research. Additionally, high throughput analysis of glycomes can only be handled properly with some sort of automated analysis pipeline that requires extensive bioinformatic support to organize the experimental data generated. In parallel, there are bioinformatic groups actively developing mathematical or statistical algorithms and computational methodologies to analyze the data and thus uncover biological knowledge underlying the biological data. Since valuable experimental data are generated at various locations and in projects that target different scientific questions, the different sources of data have to be connected to generate a more complete data repository, which may aid in gaining a clearer understanding of the functions of carbohydrates in an organism. Consequently, data integration is a prerequisite for improving the efficiency of extraction and analysis of biological information, particularly for knowledge discovery and research planning [11].Significant improvements in experimental analytical methods over recent years—particularly in glycan analysis by mass spectrometry and high performance separation techniques [12–21]—have led to a tremendous increase in the amount of carbohydrate structure data generated. The second source generating new experimental data on a large scale is the increased application of lectin and carbohydrate microarrays to probe the binding preferences of carbohydrates to proteins [22–26]. Consequently, the availability of databases and tools to store, retrieve, and analyze these data in an efficient way is of fundamental importance to progress in glycobiology [13, 15, 18, 27, 28]. Although bioinformatics for glycobiology or glycomics (‘glycoinformatics’) [29] is not yet as well established as in the fields of genomics and proteomics [30, 31], over the past few years, there has been a substantial increase in both the development, and use, of informatics tools and databases in glycosciences [32–42].In this review, we will first introduce the various representations of carbohydrates used in the literature, then provide an overview of newly developed databases for glycomics, highlighting briefly the most recent glycoinformatic developments in sequence alignment and data mining, and provide an update [38] on tools to support experimental glycan analysis. Finally, we will review the field of (3D) structural glycoinformatics and molecular modeling of carbohydrates, glycoproteins, and protein–carbohydrate interaction.The basic units of carbohydrates are the monosaccharides. Whereas the other fundamental building blocks of biological macromolecules (nucleotides and amino acids) are clearly defined and limited in their number, the situation is much more complex for the carbohydrates. This becomes immediately evident by looking at the ten most frequently occurring monosaccharides in mammals [43]: d-GlcNAc, d-Gal, d-Man, d-Neu5Ac, l-Fuc, d-GalNAc, d-Glc, d-GlcA, d-Xyl, and l-IdoA (Fig. 1). Less than half of them are unmodified hexoses (d-Glc, d-Gal, d-Man) or pentoses (d-Xyl). Most of them are modified or substituted on the parent monosaccharides (deoxy: l-Fuc; acidic: d-GlcA, l-IdoA; substituted: d-GlcNAc, d-GalNAc, d-Neu5Ac). Therefore, derivatization is for monosaccharides the rule rather than an exception. The d-form is more common, but some monosaccharides occur more frequently in their l-form. Additionally, each of them can occur in two anomeric forms (α/β) and two ring forms [pyranose (p)/furanose (f)], which results, for example, in eight forms of cyclic galactose (α-d-Galp, α-l-Galp, β-d-Galp, β-d-Galf, etc.).
Frequently occurring carbohydrate building blocks in mammalia. For each monosaccharide, the 3D structure, the IUPAC short code, and the symbols used in the Oxford (top) and CFG (bottom) symbolic nomenclature are shown. The acids (last row) are displayed with substituents (O-methyl, sulfate). α-l-IdopA is shown in two conformations (1C4 and 2S0) as they appear in heparin (pdb code 1E0O [53]). The formal charge of the monosaccharide at physiological pH is denoted in parentheses
Simplified representations of complex biological macromolecules are frequently used to communicate or encode information on their structure. One-letter codes are in use to encode nucleic acids (5 nucleotides) or proteins (20 amino acids). Since the number of basic carbohydrate units frequently found in mammals is also very limited, symbolic representations [44, 45] (Figs. 1, ​,2)2) are frequently in use and one-letter codes have also been proposed [46, 47]. However, more than 100 different monosaccharides are found in bacteria, as has been revealed by a statistical database analysis [48]. This renders the general representation of monosaccharides by one-letter codes unfeasible, and generally longer abbreviations for the monosaccharide residues have to be used. A standardized International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature for monosaccharides and oligosaccharide chains exists (http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/2carb/) [49], and full names and short codes for the common monosaccharides and derivatives have been defined (e.g., ‘Glc’ for glucose, ‘GlcNAc’ for N-acetylglucosamine). Typically the short names are derived from the trivial names of the monosaccharides (e.g. ‘Fuc’, systematic name: 6-deoxy-galactopyranose; trivial name: fucose). As already shown, in order to define the full monosaccharide short names, the anomeric descriptor, the d/l identifier and the ring form (p/f) have to be given as well, so the shortest name for ‘α-d-glucopyranose’ would be ‘α-d-Glcp’. An example of a more complex monosaccharide is N-acetyl-α-neuraminic acid; short name: α-d-Neup5Ac or α-Neu5Ac (full IUPAC name: 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-d-glycero-α-d-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonic acid).
Different graphical representations of the N-glycan GlcNAc2Man9. a CFG symbolic representation [45]. b Oxford system [44]. c Chemical drawing. d Extended IUPAC 2D graph representationThe most commonly used graphical and textual representations for carbohydrates are shown in Fig. 2. Each of these shows a different level of information content that is tailored to a particular area of glycoscience research. Glycobiologists will prefer cartoon representations (Fig. 2a, b), whereas synthetic chemists will prefer the ‘chemical’ structural drawings with full atom topology displayed (Fig. 2c). Unfortunately, there are different graphical symbols in use for the same monosaccharides, which is even confusing for scientists working in the field. An agreement on one set of symbols would be very beneficial for the community [50]. From the viewpoint of bioinformatics, the graphical representations are only relevant for structure display in the context of user interfaces. Software tools have been developed that are able to generate on-the-fly cartoon representations from a carbohydrate sequence format (which is a ‘computer representation’ of a carbohydrate structure) [51]. Although carbohydrates have been encoded successfully using the ‘computerized’ extended IUPAC (2D) representation [52] (Fig. 2d), it has been realized that a more flexible and systematic sequence format is required to encode all carbohydrate structures that occur in scientific publications.There are essentially two possible ways to encode a carbohydrate molecule: as a set of atoms that are connected through chemical bonds, or as a set of building blocks that are connected through linkages. The first approach is used in chemoinformatics and a variety of chemical file formats (e.g., CML [54], InChi [55], SMILES [56]) have been developed for encoding of molecules for storage in chemical databases like PubChem [57] or ChEBI [58]. Figure 3 shows one PubChem entry of sialyl Lewis-X together with additional structural descriptors, like molecular weight. IUPAC full names and InChi and SMILES encoding are computed from the chemical drawing; therefore, encoding of carbohydrates as InChi or auto-generated IUPAC names is possible; however, there are severe limitations. One of the main requirements for databases is to store information in an organized way that facilitates further computational processing. Based on the InChi or IUPAC code, it is, for example, very difficult to derive the monosaccharide composition of sialyl Lewis-X, which is (Neu5Ac)1(Gal)1(GlcNAc)1(Fuc)1. Additionally, since there is more than one entry for sialyl Lewis-X in the PubChem database, the automatic procedures to always generate the same InChi code for the same carbohydrate may need to be improved in order to generate unique IDs for carbohydrates. Although it is possible to develop software that parses InChi codes and assigns knowledge about monosaccharides to a database entry, InChi may not be the first choice for the encoding of carbohydrate structures. Consequently, it would be much more efficient to encode carbohydrates using a residue-based approach similar to the sequences of genes and proteins. However, there are two significant differences: the number of building blocks (residues) may be very large due to frequently occurring modifications of the parent monosaccharides, and the carbohydrate chains frequently contain branches, which means that many carbohydrates are tree-like molecules.
PubChem entry of sialyl Lewis-X together with structural descriptors like IUPAC name and InChi and SMILES codeThe prerequisite for a residue-based encoding format is a controlled vocabulary of the residue names. For practical reasons, the number of residues should be kept as small as possible. The main difficulty in encoding monosaccharide names in a systematic way is the definition of clear rules about which atoms of a molecule belong to a monosaccharide residue and which are, for example, of type ‘non-monosaccharide’ (e.g., substituent). The following short list will illustrate the dilemma: Glc, Gal, GlcN, GlcNAc, GalNAc, GlcOAc. For a biologist, all of them would be monosaccharides on their own (glucose, galactose, glucosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, etc.) except GlcOAc, which would be a glucose carrying an ‘acetyl’ substituent. From an encoding point of view, it makes more sense that all entries are of type ‘Glc’ or ‘Gal’ and N, NAc, and OAc are substituents, respectively. Even for bacterial monosaccharides, this would result in a reasonably sized ‘monosaccharide base type’ residue list {Glc, Gal, …} and ‘non-monosaccharide’ residue list {N, NAc, OAc, …}, which is much easier to maintain.Over the years, each database project that aimed to store carbohydrate structures developed a new sequence format (see Table 1). Because of this, translation tools for the different formats were necessary to establish cross-links between the databases. In the context of the EUROCarbDB design study, which aimed at developing standards for glycoinformatics, a new carbohydrate sequence format for use in databases (GlycoCT) [59] has been established as well as a reference database for monosaccharide notation (http://www.monosaccharidedb.org). The GlycomeDB [60] project uses GlycoCT as a standard format for the integration of all open access carbohydrate structure databases (Fig. 4). Recently, as a result of a close collaboration between developers at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC) and EUROCarbDB, the Glyde-II format (http://glycomics.ccrc.uga.edu/GLYDE-II/) was created where concepts of Glyde [61] and GlycoCT [59] were combined in order to define a new standard exchange format for carbohydrate structures [27].

Major carbohydrate structure databases and the sequence formats used
aCurrently queried by GlycomeDBGlycomeDB entry of sialyl Lewis-X. The structure is displayed in a ‘human readable’ encoding (CFG cartoons) at the top and in a ‘computer readable’ sequence format (GlycoCT) at the bottom. Additionally, links to external databases and information on structural motifs are availableFor many applications in glycoinformatics, it is required to classify glycans based on occurring structural motifs or patterns, or to compare two carbohydrates and to establish a similarity score. Despite many efforts, this is still an open problem due to the lack of broadly accepted metrics on carbohydrate structures. Algorithms based on adapting the already established sequence alignment approaches from DNA, RNA, and protein sequences to carbohydrates and establishing a scoring matrix for substitutions have been proposed [62, 63]. However, discovery of biomarkers or more broadly extracting discriminating patterns from sets of carbohydrates poses a great challenge due to their branched nature and the possibility that a significant pattern can be fragmented and distributed across multiple branches of the carbohydrate. Traditional pattern discovery and classification techniques from machine learning have been applied with increasing success to meet this challenge. Markov models were used to discover patterns spanning multiple branches [62, 63]. Then the focus shifted to Support Vector Machines and the search for kernels appropriate for branched structures [64–66]. Recently, a novel statistical approach for motif discovery that currently outperforms all competing methods has been presented [67].The information explosion in biology makes it difficult for researchers to stay up-to-date with current biomedical knowledge and to make sense of the massive amounts of online information. Ontologies are increasingly enabling biomedical researchers to accomplish these tasks [68]. An ontology provides a shared vocabulary, which can be used to model a domain of interest, and it defines the type of objects and concepts that exist, and their properties and relations. Ontologies are often represented graphically as a hierarchical structure of concepts (nodes) that are connected by their relationships (edges). Concepts and relationships are assigned unique ontological names. For example, the ontological concepts ‘carbohydrate’ and ‘molecule’ can be connected by the hierarchical relationship ‘is_a’. In this way, ontologies can be used to provide a formal mechanism to categorize objects by specifying their membership in a specific class. The Glycomics Ontology (GlycO) focuses on the glycoproteomics domain to model the structure and functions of glycans and glycoconjugates, the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis and modification, and the metabolic pathways in which they participate. GlycO is intended to provide both a schema and a sufficiently large knowledge base, which will allow classification of concepts commonly encountered in the field of glycobiology in order to facilitate automated information analysis in this domain [69, 70] (for more information, see the web site http://lsdis.cs.uga.edu/projects/glycomics/).A hexasaccharide can, in theory, build 1012 structural isomers [71]. Although such large numbers highlight the intrinsic complexity of carbohydrates, the actual number of carbohydrates in nature is probably significantly smaller. Modeling of enzyme kinetics and estimating the size and diversity of the glycome has been of considerable interest to the field of glycobiology. The first attempt to establish mathematical models of N-type glycosylation occurred over 10 years ago [72], by employing the known enzymatic activities of glycosyltransferases involved in the N-type glycosylation pathway and generating all possible carbohydrates resulting from those activities up to the first galactosylation of an oligosaccharide. This work was then extended [73] by using less simplifying assumptions and extending the set of enzymes included in the model. Recent advances have led to the ability to estimate enzyme reaction rates and enzyme concentrations from mass spectrometry data, thereby opening up the possibility to infer changes to the enzyme concentrations in diseased tissues [74]. Similarly, the expression profiles of glycosyltransferases were used to predict the repertoire of potential glycan structures [75, 76]. A recent estimation of the size of the human glycome based on biosynthetic pathway knowledge approximates the upper limit of distinct carbohydrates to be in the range of hundreds of thousands [77]. Currently, there are about 35,000 distinct carbohydrate structures stored in databases [60]; however, nobody knows how many carbohydrate structures have already been discovered or published so far, since no comprehensive database of carbohydrate structures exists. Statistical analyses of the structures stored in GLYCOSCIENCES.de and the Bacterial Carbohydrate Structure Database (BCSDB) have been performed and showed the differences between available structures from the mammalian and bacterial glycome [48]. The ‘chemical analysis’ of the database entries revealed that about 36 chemical building blocks (=monosaccharide + branching level) would be required for the chemical synthesis of 75% of the mammalian glycans [43]. Unfortunately, the situation is much more complex for the bacterial carbohydrates. However, if one would concentrate on the synthesis of a particular subclass of bacterial carbohydrates (e.g., for vaccine development) the diversity becomes much smaller.A variety of databases are available to the glycoscientist [32, 36, 78–80]. From the viewpoint of glycoproteins, they can be grouped into databases that contain information on the proteins themselves, databases that store information on the enzymes and pathways that build the glycans, and carbohydrate structure databases [36, 37]. Only limited information is available in databases on glycoforms of glycoproteins.The complex carbohydrate structure database (CCSD)—often referred to as CarbBank in reference to its query software—was developed and maintained for more than 10 years by the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center of the University of Georgia (USA) [52, 81]. The CCSD was the largest effort during the 1990s to collect the structures of carbohydrates, mainly through retrospective manual extraction from literature. The main aim of the CCSD was to catalog all publications in which complex carbohydrate structures were reported. Unfortunately, funding for the CCSD stopped during the second half of the 1990s and the database was no longer updated. Nevertheless, with almost 50,000 records (from 14,000 publications) relating to approximately 23,500 different carbohydrate sequences, the CCSD is still one of the largest repositories of carbohydrate-related data. Subsets of the CCSD data have been incorporated into almost all recent open access databases, of which the major ones are GLYCOSCIENCES.de (23,233) [82], KEGG Glycan database (10,969) [83], CFG Glycan Database (8,626) [84], Bacterial Carbohydrate Structure Database (BCSDB, 6,789) [85], and GlycoBase (377) [86]. The numbers in parentheses denote the number of distinct carbohydrate sequences (without aglycons) stored in the database (based on GlycomeDB analysis, October 2008). Recently, the JCGGDB, which assembles CabosDB, Galaxy, LipidBank, GlycoEpitope, LfDB, and SGCAL (with 1,490 unique carbohydrate structures) and the GlycoSuiteDB (with about 3,300 unique carbohydrate structures) [87] have become freely accessible as well.The EUROCarbDB project (http://www.eurocarbdb.org) was a design study that aimed to create the foundations for a new infrastructure of distributed databases and bioinformatics tools where scientists themselves can upload carbohydrate structure-related data. Fundamental ethics of the project were that all data are freely accessible and all provided tools are open source. A prototype of a database application has been developed that can store carbohydrate structures plus additional data such as biological context (organism, tissue, disease, etc.), and literature references. Primary experimental data (MS, HPLC, and NMR) that can serve as evidence or reference data for the carbohydrate structure in question can be uploaded as well (Fig. 5).
EUROCarbDB web interface. a The GlycanBuilder Tool [51] serves as an interface for structure input. Various graphical representations are supported and can be changed interactively. b Result of a structure search in the database. The first three entries contain associated MS data as evidence for the structureUntil recently, there was hardly any direct cross-linking between the established carbohydrate databases [88]. This is mainly due to the fact that the various databases use different sequence formats to encode carbohydrate structures [59] (Table 1). Therefore, the situation in glycoinformatics has been characterized by the existence of multiple disconnected and incompatible islands of experimental data, data resources, and specific applications, managed by various consortia, institutions, or local groups [27, 37]. Importantly, no comprehensive and curated database of carbohydrate structures currently exists. From the user’s point of view, the lack of cross-links between carbohydrate databases means that, until recently, they had to visit different database web portals in order to retrieve all the available information on a specific carbohydrate structure. Additionally, the users might have had to acquaint themselves with the different local query options, some of which require knowledge of the encoding of the residues in the respective database.In 2005, a new initiative was begun to overcome the isolation of the carbohydrate structure databases and to create a comprehensive index of all available structures with references back to the original databases. To achieve this goal, most structures of the freely available databases were translated to the GlycoCT sequence format [59], and stored in a new database, the GlycomeDB [60]. The integration process is performed incrementally on a weekly basis, updating the GlycomeDB with the newest structures available in the associated databases. During the integration process, some automated checks are performed. Structures that contain errors are reported to the administrators of the original database. A web interface has been developed (http://www.glycome-db.org) as a single query point for all open access carbohydrate structure databases [89] (Fig. 4).Advances in recent years have led to an explosive growth of data from carbohydrate microarray experiments, coming from multiple research laboratories, each employing their own proprietary technology for spotting the array [22, 98–101]. Unfortunately, the often radically different approaches to the spotting of the arrays can change the binding affinities observed. This inhomogeneity in the way the data are generated has caused problems in the comparative analysis and evaluation of the data. Further complications arise from lack of comprehensive applications to manage the data generated in the experiments and also computational approaches to perform analytical studies. There is a clear need in this area for more research and development of computational approaches and tools. Particularly, the standards for reporting glycan array experiments need to be defined [102].Currently, there is one major public resource for glycan array data provided by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) (http://www.functionalglycomics.org). The CFG supported the development of the first robot-produced, publicly available micro-titer-based glycan array. The currently used printed mammalian glycan microarray format (version 4.1) comprises 465 synthetic and natural glycan sequences representing major glycan structures of glycoproteins and glycolipids [103]. In 2008, a pathogen glycan array was also made available for screening, containing 96 polysaccharides derived from Gram-negative bacteria. The protein–glycan interaction core (H) analyzes investigator-generated lectins, antibodies, antisera, microorganisms, or suspected glycan binding proteins (GBP) of human, animal, and microbial origins on the mammalian and pathogen glycan microarrays. Fluorescent reagents are used for detecting primary binding to the glycans on the array. The results of the screening performed by the Core H can be accessed through the consortium web page, and the raw data can be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet [84] (Fig. 6). The website offers an interactive bar-chart that dynamically displays the glycan structures upon a mouse click on the signal of interest. Links to CFG databases that contain curated information on the GBP and the glycan structures printed on the array are available.

Affinity data from different techniques (FAC, SPR, FP) are also availableA second large resource of carbohydrate–protein interaction data is the Lectin Frontier DataBase (LfDB) provided by the Japanese Consortium for Glycobiology and Glycotechnology (JCGG). A significant part of the data may have been generated as part of the structural glycomics project funded by New Energy and Industrial Technology Organization (NEDO) [104]. In contrast to the CFG glycan microarray database, which provides relative fluorescence units (FU), the LfDB provides affinity constants (K
a) determined by frontal affinity chromatography [24, 105]. Similar to the CFG website, users can navigate to the experimental data using the lectin as an entry point. The data are also presented as an interactive bar-chart (Fig. 7). Since the site is to a large extent in Japanese, it is somewhat difficult to explore the full functionality of the web-interface at the moment.
Lectin Frontier Database. a LfDB web interface providing access to the experimental data and related information. b The LfDB dataset in the GlyAffinity database. Crosslinks via a carbohydrate entry to additional experiments and literature references are shownRecently, a prototype for an integrated database for protein–carbohydrate interaction, ‘GlyAffinity’, has been developed at the German Cancer Research Center. The database aims at providing a comprehensive repository of curated protein–carbohydrate interaction data from various sources and techniques (Figs. 6b and ​and7b).7b). The publicly available microarray experiments conducted by the CFG have been acquired and processed. This entailed the parsing of the data, conversion of the carbohydrate structures to the GlycoCT format, and curation of an initial set of approximately 100 experiments for inclusion in the database. The complete contents of the Lectin Frontier DataBase have also been imported and curated, and publications have been scoured for data and manually entered. The Leffler Laboratory (Lund, Sweden) provided access to their primary data, which has been processed and partially imported, and initial steps have been taken to include the data generated by the Feizi Laboratory (London, UK). Access to the data is provided through an interactive web-interface, which offers options to locate data either by lectin or carbohydrate structure. Each lectin entry is classified according to the established hierarchical lectin family scheme [106–108] and provides a list of experiments conducted with their experimental conditions and technique. The pages of the individual experiments feature the full list of carbohydrates, their recorded affinity, and the possibility to detect standard motifs.A current limitation in making full use of protein–carbohydrate interaction data is the lack of systematic analysis methods for extracting information, most importantly the deduction of the binding epitope. Recently, the development of a novel algorithm to detect the occurrence of significant motifs in carbohydrate microarray experiments has been reported [109]. The approach entails the selection of 63 commonly occurring carbohydrate motifs (e.g., Lewis-X, terminal beta-GalNAc, etc.) and processing the complex carbohydrates found on the CFG microarray to detect their presence. Subsequent analysis of the occurrences of a motif in the carbohydrate structures of a particular experiment together with the fluorescence intensity measured yields information about the specificity the lectin exhibits towards a subset of the motifs.Carbohydrates are frequently covalently attached to or interact non-covalently with proteins, and the biosynthesis of carbohydrates involves the action of hundreds of different enzymes. Consequently, databases that contain information on enzymes, biological pathways, glycoproteins, and lectins are of major interest to a glycobiologist (Table 2). The CAZy database [110] provides a comprehensive repository of carbohydrate active enzymes classified by sequence similarity into distinct families. The CAZy database is highly curated, and its family classification system [111] is frequently used in glycobiology. EC numbers are also annotated in the database, which relates structural features to the observed functions of the enzymes. Cross-links to access 3D structures of the enzymes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [112] are also available. BRENDA [113] is broader in its scope and offers information on all known enzymes identified by their EC number. A valuable resource for biochemical pathways is the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [83] (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). KEGG PATHWAY is a database that represents molecular interaction networks, including metabolic pathways, regulatory pathways, and molecular complexes. The integration of carbohydrate structures from the KEGG GLYCAN database into the glycan-related pathways makes it possible to relate carbohydrate structures to genes. A variety of other carbohydrate-related tools are available, which makes KEGG an important informatics resource for glycobiology. The KEGG enzymes are also encoded as EC numbers. Other databases containing information on carbohydrate active enzymes are the GlycoGene Database (GGDB) [114], the CFG glycosyltransferase database [84], and the CERMAV glycosyltransferase database [115]. Curated databases of Glycan Binding Proteins (Lectins) are maintained by the CFG (GBP molecules DB), CERMAV (Lectines DB), and JCGG (Lectin Frontier DB) [96]. More detailed information on animal lectins can be found on the website “A genomics resource for animal lectins” (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/research/animallectins/), which also offers valuable data on lectin families and their roles in recognition processes. GlycoEpitope is an integrated database of carbohydrate antigens and antibodies [116] and is available now in the context of the JCGGDBs. The various databases that provide information on enzymes and lectins frequently provide direct links to entries in the Protein Data Bank if available. The O-GlycBase database [117] offers a curated set of experimentally verified O-glycosylated proteins. GlycoProtDB, which is part of JCGGDB, provides information on glycoproteins from C. elegans N2 and mouse tissues [118]. A very valuable information resource on glycoproteins is GlycoSuiteDB [87] cross-linked with UniProt/SWISS-PROT [119].
Protein databases that contain carbohydrate related information (see also [32])Over the years, the increased application of a variety of methods for glycan analysis have led to the development of many software tools that aim to assist in the interpretation of the experimental data generated. High-throughput methods are mainly based on mass spectrometry (MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) due to their sensitivity. Many of these methods rely on reference data of known carbohydrates from databases. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has always played a key role in the de novo determination of carbohydrate structures [122], and some new tools that aim at decreasing the time needed for NMR peak assignment have been recently developed (Table 3).

Automatic interpretation of MS data remains a challenging task due to the technique only being able to report masses of the fragments observed. This information can be used to calculate a set of potential compositions the carbohydrate could have, which then give rise to a set of potential carbohydrates that satisfy the composition constraints. One of the first tools to deduce potential carbohydrate compositions from MS data is the GlycoMod online service [123]. The number of compositions matching a certain mass value scales exponentially with the number of different monomers; therefore, taxonomic and biosynthetic information have to be incorporated in the assignment process so that smart choices can be made based upon a given composition. The Cartoonist tool [124–127] uses a set of archetypal structures in combination with a set of rules for their potential modification to generate all types of glycans that could be possibly synthesized by mammalian cells. Archetypes and rules have been compiled by a group of experts and represent the current knowledge on biosynthetic pathways in mammalian organisms. The number of matching structures is thus greatly reduced by avoiding implausible molecules. Cartoonist has been extended over the years, and now uses a well-tested library of structures, scoring routines to establish confidence scores in an annotation, and knowledge of biochemical pathways to aid the interpretation of spectra. Cartoonist is used as an analysis tool for the glycan profiling service of the CFG.De novo sequencing tools based on MSn fragmentation data are STAT [128], OSCAR [129] StrOligo [130], and GLYCH [131]. Glyco-Peakfinder [132] is a new web-service for the de novo determination of the composition of glycan-derived MS signals independent of the source of spectral data. Library-based sequencing methods—similar to those applied in proteomics—are also applied in glycomics, where experimental peaks of MS2 spectra are compared with online calculated theoretical fragments from user-definable carbohydrate sequences deposited in databases (glyco-fragment mass fingerprinting). Such an approach is supported by the GlycoSearchMS service [133], where Glyco-Fragment [134] is used to calculate fragment-libraries of all carbohydrates contained in GLYCOSCIENCES.de. GlycosidIQ™ [135] is a similar mass fingerprinting tool developed for interpretation of oligosaccharide mass spectrometric fragmentation based on matching experimental data with theoretically fragmented oligosaccharides generated from the database GlycoSuiteDB [87]. However, the success of such an approach depends on the comprehensiveness of experimentally determined glycan structures included in the database. GlycoWorkbench [136], one of the most recent tools for the computer-assisted annotation of mass spectra of glycans, has been developed as an open source project in the context of the EUROCarbDB project. The main task of GlycoWorkbench is to evaluate a set of structures proposed by the user by matching the corresponding theoretical list of fragment masses against the list of peaks derived from the spectrum. For annotation, GlycoWorkbench uses a database of carbohydrate structures derived from GLYCOSCIENCES.de, CarbBank, and CFG glycan. The tool provides an easy to use graphical interface, a comprehensive and increasing set of structural constituents, an exhaustive collection of fragmentation types, and a broad list of annotation options. Mass spectra annotated with GlycoWorkbench can be uploaded into the EUROCarbDB MS database. GlyQuest [137] and GlycoMiner [138] are new tools that support high-throughput composition and primary structure determination of N-glycans attached to peptides, based on CID (collision induced dissociation) MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometric data). Also new is SysBioWare [139], a general software platform for carbohydrate assignment based on MS data. More specialized applications have been reported for the analysis of glycosaminoglycans [140], in silico fragmentation of peptides linked to N-glycans [141], and identifiying the peptide moiety of sulfated or sialylated carbohydrates [142]. Of further interest for bioinformatic developers might be the OpenMS [143] initiative that provides an open source framework for mass spectrometry and TOPPView [144], an open source viewer for MS data.The development of robust high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technologies continues to improve the detailed analysis and sequencing of glycan structures released from glycoproteins. In the context of the EUROCarbDB project, an analytical tool (autoGU) [86] was developed to assist in the interpretation, assignment, and annotation of HPLC-glycan profiles. AutoGU assigns provisional structures to each integrated HPLC peak and, when used in combination with exoglycosidase digestions, progressively assigns each structure automatically based on the footprint data. The software is assisted by GlycoBase, a relational database originally developed at the Oxford Glycobiology Institute, which contains the HPLC elution positions for over 350 2-AB labelled N-glycan structures together with digestion pathways. The system is suitable for automated analysis of N-linked sugars released from glycoproteins and allows detection of the carbohydrates at femtomolar concentrations [18].ProSpectND is an advanced integrated NMR data processing and inspection tool, originally developed at the University of Utrecht and refined during the EUROCarbDB project. It allows batch processing of spectra simulations and automated graphics generation. CASPER is a tool for calculating chemical shifts of oligo- and polysaccharides as well as N- and O-glycans. The tool already has a long history [145, 146] and has recently received a major upgrade. CASPER can also be used for determining the primary structures of carbohydrates by simulating spectra of a set of possible structures and comparing them with the supplied experimental data to find the best match. The Collaborative Computing Project for the NMR community (CCPN) has developed a powerful data model for NMR experiments [147] and an assignment package for NMR spectra of proteins and peptides (CcpNmr Analysis) [148]. As a result of an intensive EUROCarbDB/CCPN collaboration, support for (branched) carbohydrates was added to the CCPN data model and CcpNmr Analysis software. Additionally, CASPER can be used to automatically assign NMR signals to carbohydrate atoms in connection with CcpNmr Analysis. CCPN project files can be directly uploaded into the EUROCarbDB NMR database.Glycosylation is the most common post-translational modification of proteins [1]. Initial analyses yielded a consensus sequence motif for N-type glycosylation, Asn-X-Ser/Thr, with any amino acid at X except proline. Every N-type glycosylation site adheres to this motif, but its sole presence in the amino acid sequence is only a necessity and not sufficient to predict the presence of a glycan. The situation becomes further complicated when one considers mucin-type or other types of O-glycosylation where the glycan is usually attached to a serine or threonine. Research in this area over the last 10 years has resulted in a series of approaches for the prediction of glycosylation sites (Table 4). All strategies for the prediction of glycosylation sites are of a statistical nature: NetCGlyc [149], NetNGlyc [150], NetOGlyc [151], and YinOYang [150] all use neural networks for the prediction of glycosylation sites; big-Pi [152] employs scoring functions based on amino acid properties; GPI-SOM [153] uses a Kohonen map; CKSAAP_OGlySite [154], and EnsembleGly [155] use a Support Vector Machine based approach; and GPP [156], the currently best performing predication tool, uses a hybrid combinatorial and statistical learning approach based on random forests. Training datasets for the statistical learning approaches are usually derived from the PDB or O-GLYCBASE [117].
Tools for prediction and analysis of glycosylation sitesThe mechanism of acceptor site selection for the covalent attachment of carbohydrates by a series of glycosyl transferases in the case of C-type and O-type glycosylation, and by the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) for N-type glycosylation, is still not completely understood. This has led to studies on the statistical and structural properties of amino acids in the neighborhood of glycosylation sites. Conformational and statistical properties of N-type glycosylation sites were analyzed based on glycosylated proteins found in the PDB [157]. Statistical properties of O-type glycosylation were analyzed based on entries of the O-GLYCBASE [158]. The GlySeq and GlyVicinity online services [159] allow for interactive exploration of the statistical and conformational properties of glycosylation sites and their surroundings.Complex carbohydrates represent a particularly challenging class of molecules in terms of describing their three-dimensional (3D) structure. Due to their inherent flexibility, these molecules very often exist in solution as an ensemble of conformations rather than as a single well-defined structure. Traditionally, NMR methods, especially Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) measurements, have been widely used to study oligosaccharide conformation in solution [160, 161]. Unfortunately, many oligosaccharide NOEs cannot be resolved or are difficult to assign. Additionally, there are often too few inter-residue NOEs to make an unambiguous 3D structure determination possible. In general, the interpretation of structural experimental data frequently needs to be supported by molecular modeling methods [162, 163]. One of the main aims of computer modeling of carbohydrates is to generate reasonable 3D models that can be used to rationalize experimentally derived observations. Conformational analysis by computational methods consequently plays a key role in the determination of 3D structures of complex carbohydrates.In recent years, a variety of modeling methods have been applied to the conformational analysis of carbohydrates [164]. Of these, the calculation of conformational maps for disaccharides using systematic search methods, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of oligosaccharides in explicit solvent, are by far the most popular methods in modeling of carbohydrate 3D structures [165–168]. Although quantum mechanics (ab initio) methods are used for modeling of carbohydrate conformation, these methods are still computationally too demanding to be used routinely to study or predict the 3D structure of complex carbohydrates. Quantum mechanics methods are mainly used to study chemical reactions [169–171], to calculate force constants and atom charges to be used as force field parameters [172, 173], or for the conformational analysis of smaller carbohydrates [174–176].In general, molecular modeling methods are applied in glycobiology at various levels of required expertise and computer equipment. Simple model building using a molecular builder will already give one valuable insight: complex carbohydrates look in 3D very different from the impression one gets by looking at chemical drawings or cartoon representations. Also, the simple overlay in 3D of a new carbohydrate ligand onto an existing one in a crystal structure can give valuable first insight into a possible binding mode. However, one has to be aware of the limitations of such basic modeling approaches: molecular builders generate one reasonable conformation out of many; and manually overlaying two carbohydrates in a binding site is a strong bias towards one predefined binding mode and alternative binding modes are unlikely to be discovered. The other extremes would be to perform a complete conformational analysis of a complex carbohydrate based on extensive MD simulations in explicit solvent, which may take weeks of calculation time, and GBytes of simulation data need to be analyzed afterwards, or to screen the complete protein surface for carbohydrate binding sites using extensive dockings based on genetic search algorithms. Recently, even high-level Car-Parinello-based ab initio MD simulations combined with metadynamics simulation have been applied to carbohydrates [170, 177, 178]. The question which modeling method would work best for solving a specific scientific problem is not always straightforward to answer. For example, if exploring the accessible conformational space of a carbohydrate is of major interest then the MD simulation could also be performed in gas phase at higher temperatures instead of running an extensive MD simulation in explicit solvent at room temperature. However, for some systems, the use of explicit solvent is necessary,while for others, one would reach the same conclusions based on gas phase simulations, but with much less computational cost. As is the case with ‘experimental’ methods, ‘experience’ is the key to successful application of molecular modeling methods in most cases.Since the beginning of the 1990s, more and more crystal structures have been reported where carbohydrates are covalently attached to a (glyco) protein or constitute the ligand in a protein–carbohydrate complex [179, 180]. These experimentally determined 3D structures are freely accessible from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [112]. So, over recent years, the PDB has become a very valuable resource for obtaining conformational properties of carbohydrates [181]. However, it has to be kept in mind that crystals are often grown under non-physiological conditions, and flexible molecules like carbohydrates may change conformation due to strong forces induced by crystallographic packing.A variety of reviews and book chapters on conformational analysis of carbohydrates have been published and are recommended for further reading [46, 165, 166, 182].The two major databases where experimentally determined carbohydrate structures are stored are the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD, http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/products/csd/) and the Protein Data Bank (PDB, http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/). Many crystal structures of small oligosaccharides [183] are also accessible through the Glyco3D web interface (http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/glyco3d/).The PDB [112] currently contains more than 60,000 3D structures of biomolecules, of which about 4,000 contain carbohydrates [184]. Most of the carbohydrates in the PDB are either connected covalently to a (glyco)protein, or the carbohydrate forms a complex with a lectin, enzyme, or antibody. Isolated carbohydrates are only rarely found in the PDB. When looking at the carbohydrate structures of a PDB entry, one has to keep in mind that frequently only fragments of the original carbohydrates may be resolved (Fig. 8). Additionally, the 3D structures of the carbohydrates in the PDB do not always meet high quality standards; therefore, one has to look at the structures with care. It has been recognized that, in order to improve the quality of the 3D structures contained in the PDB, theoretical validation procedures for carbohydrates have to be established [184–186]. Despite these limitations, the PDB is an important source of information on carbohydrate 3D structures [187]. Unfortunately, due to the lack of a consistently used nomenclature for carbohydrates in PDB files, it is difficult to find the entries of interest. To overcome this problem, the GLYCOSCIENCES.de web portal [187] and the Glycoconjugate Data Bank: Structures (http://www.glycostructures.jp) [188] offer convenient ways to search for carbohydrate structures in the PDB.

N-Glycosylation site of Phanerochaete chrysosporium Laminarinase 16A (pdb code 2W52 [189]). Although the resolution of the X-ray crystal structure is rather high (1.56 Å), parts of the N-glycan are not visible in the electron density due to the high flexibility of the branch linked to position 3 of the core mannoseStatistical analysis of structural parameters of the carbohydrates present in the PDB entries can be performed with the tools GlySeq, GlyVicinity, GlyTorsion, and carp (http://www.glycosciences.de/tools) [159]. GlySeq checks the type of amino acids that are in the sequence neighborhood of N- and O-glycosylation sites, GlyVicinity performs an analysis of the population of amino acids in the spatial vicinity of carbohydrate residues, and GlyTorsion provides access to the torsion angles of the glycosidic linkages. Using the carp tool (CArbohydrate Ramachandran Plot), these torsions can be compared to theoretical Ramachandran-type conformational maps stored in GlycoMapsDB [185]. This service can be used by crystallographers to cross-check or validate the carbohydrate 3D structures similar to the Ramachandran plot analysis that is routinely used to evaluate the backbone torsions of protein structures.Easy-to-use and freely available Web-based tools [32, 190] are available to generate an initial model of a carbohydrate 3D structure. SWEET-II [191] is a frequently used carbohydrate 3D builder that is available on the GLYCOSCIENCES.de [82] website, which also provides the GlyProt [192] tool for in silico glycosylation of proteins derived from the PDB. A very nice builder for carbohydrates and glycoproteins is also available at the GLYCAM website (http://www.glycam.com). The first molecular builder for carbohydrates was probably POLYS [193] and the latest development in this field is FSPS (fast sugar structure prediction software) [194]. However, it is unclear whether POLYS or FSPS are available to the scientific community via a website or for download. A web-portal to perform MD simulations of carbohydrates over the Internet [195] was recently shut down because the glycoinformatics group that maintained the service was closed [42].Despite the significant limitations that still exist, the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has turned out to be an excellent methodology to study the conformational properties of carbohydrates and other biomolecules [163, 196–199]. Although quantum mechanics-based MD simulations have recently become feasible, most applications of MD are still based on force fields. The development of carbohydrate force fields in itself is a challenging task and is still in progress [172, 173, 200]. Because carbohydrates are polar molecules, the proper treatment of atom charges is likely to be of significant importance particularly for modeling of intermolecular interactions [201]. The discussion about including extra terms for (exo) anomeric effects into force fields has a long tradition in carbohydrate modeling [202–205]. The solvent model used for the MD simulation also has a significant effect on the results [206]. In order to make the outcome of an MD simulation more reliable, the theoretical results should always be compared to experimental results if possible. It has to be kept in mind that disagreement between computational and experimental results does not necessarily mean that the force field used is inappropriate for the simulation of carbohydrate structures. It can also mean that other simulation parameters used are not appropriate (e.g., simulation time, solvent model) or possibly that there is a significant error in the experimental results themselves. However, experimental results are very important for validating the quality of theoretical calculations. In recent years, MD simulations have been used to study conformations of complex carbohydrates [206–209], glycolipids [200, 210, 211], glycopeptides [212], glycoproteins [213, 214], protein–carbohydrate complexes [215–217], protein–glycopeptide interaction [218], carbohydrate–ion interaction [219], and carbohydrate–water interaction [220].The MD simulation of a complex oligosaccharide or glycoprotein in a solvent box is computationally very expensive, and CPU time of many weeks or months may be required in order to simulate a timescale of only a few nanoseconds [221] (Fig. 9). The timescales of most of the published MD simulations involving carbohydrates are in the range of up to 50 ns. However, in order to achieve convergence for the rotamer populations of the exocylic C–C torsions, the length of an MD simulation should be longer than 100 ns [206, 222]. Although water models like TIP5P are a better approximation of water, in most MD simulations much simpler water models, like SPC or TIP3P [223, 224], are used because of calculation speed and because most force field parameters have been tailored to these simple models. The trajectory files of an MD simulation are typically many GBytes in size. With the availability of supercomputers terabytes of MD data can be produced easily within a short time. The current bottleneck in the application of MD simulations is therefore hard disk space and the requirement to analyze and interpret very quickly the huge amount of data produced. Analysis tools that are part of the MD software distributions [225–227], and which have been mainly developed for the analysis of proteins, are frequently used for the analysis of MD trajectories of carbohydrates. However, because of the limitations of the available tools, glycoscientists tend to develop their own ‘in-house’ analysis software. Recently, ‘Conformational Analysis Tools’ (CAT) [228], a novel software for the analysis of MD trajectories, has been made publicly available. CAT is optimized for the efficient conformational analysis of carbohydrates, glycoproteins, and protein–carbohydrate complexes. In summary, MD simulations provide valuable additional information on the conformational dynamics of the system investigated, which is frequently not available from experimental methods. However, although performing simple MD simulations is straightforward in most cases, the correct setup and interpretation of the results requires expert knowledge, and the limitations of the method have to be taken into account.
MD simulation of SIV gp120 glycoprotein (M. Frank, unpublished). Complete N-glycans were modeled at 13 glycosylation sites based on the X-ray structure (pdb code 2BF1 [229]). a Solvation shell of a selected N-glycan on the protein surface. b A significant surface area of the protein is shielded by the N-glycans. The molecular system has more than 100,000 atoms (4,832 protein atoms, 3,432 carbohydrate atoms, 30,665 water molecules, 4 chloride ions). Water molecules are not shown for clarityOne of the major challenges in molecular modeling at the moment is the development of efficient and accurate methods to estimate the binding affinity of protein–carbohydrate complexes [46]. The application of docking methods to study protein–carbohydrate interaction has lately significantly increased [230–236]. Typically, a flexible ligand is docked to a rigid receptor; however, examples are reported where receptor flexibility has been included in the docking protocol [237–239]. Next to an efficient searching algorithm, the availability of a robust scoring function is critical for the success of docking [240]. Bridging water molecules and CH–π interactions [241–243] play a major role in the interaction of a carbohydrate and a protein. However, for various reasons, it is difficult to include these factors into the scoring functions of available standard docking software (e.g. AutoDOCK) [244]. Therefore, despite the many successful applications of docking methods, there are still significant problems with respect to the correct prediction of carbohydrate binding sites and relative affinities in some cases.If a 3D structure of a protein–carbohydrate complex is available (e.g. an X-ray structure), MD simulations can be performed to study the local interactions (hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, water bridges) in more detail [245, 246] or to calculate free energy [247–249] and entropy changes upon binding [250]. Since polar OH groups of carbohydrates quite frequently like to bind in areas where water molecules are also found on the protein surface, an investigation of the water binding sites is of particular interest [251–253].From the bioinformatics point of view, carbohydrates are a particularly challenging class of biomolecules. Like nucleic acids or proteins, they are assembled from a set of molecular building blocks; however, due to multiple linkage types and sites, even linear carbohydrates are much more complex. Additionally, complex carbohydrates frequently contain one or more branches, which renders most of the sequence algorithms developed for genes not applicable to carbohydrates, and so more complicated tree-based algorithms have to be developed and applied. As a result, established bioinformatics groups seem to neglect carbohydrates to a large extent, and only a few glycoinformatic pioneers face the challenge to develop computer algorithms for carbohydrate sequences.Significant improvements in glycan analysis and the application of carbohydrate microarrays in glycomics research have led to a significant increase in the amount of experimental data generated. Unfortunately, because of the lack of an established glycoinformatics infrastructure and standards in the field, each research group or consortium has developed their own storage formats, databases, and tools. This renders data integration and exchange very difficult. In recent years, it has become obvious that this situation needs to be changed in the future, and centrally integrated, curated, and comprehensive databases are required for glycomics, similar to proteomics and genomics [27, 38, 254]. Despite this insight, it is very difficult to establish a global glycoinformatics infrastructure at the moment due to the lack of funding and leadership. This is particularly unfortunate because, in recent years, the field has made significant progress: a standard glycan sequence format (GlycoCT) has been developed; and GlycomeDB integrates globally all carbohydrate structure databases and makes the structures searchable for scientists through one central web-interface. In the context of the EUROCarbDB project, standards, tools, and databases have been developed to store carbohydrate structures, analytical data, biological context, and literature references. Recently, a database prototype (GlyAffinity) that aims at integrating all types of protein–carbohydrate interaction data has been developed; the bioinformatic cores of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) and the Japan Consortium for Glycobiology and Glycotechnology (JCGG) are making available a vast amount of experimental data; and the EuroGlycoArrays Consortium has just entered the field and will provide more experimental data for the community. Last but not least, in recent years, people working in the field have really started to talk to each other, which is an important catalyst for establishing bioinformatics standards and fueling data integration.Over the years, established methods in structural glycobiology, like X-ray crystallography, NMR, and molecular modeling, have provided valuable insights into the three-dimensional structures of carbohydrates, glycoproteins and protein–carbohydrate complexes. This has further improved our understanding of the functions of glycans, and may help to design better enzymes, drugs, or vaccines [10, 255–258]. It has been realized within the PDB consortium [112] that the data representation and validation of carbohydrates in the PDB needs to be revised. Working groups have been established recently to develop a new format for representing carbohydrates in the PDB, and to recommend new computational tools to be developed [259], as well as to develop standards for glycomics databases and experimental reporting [260].For a long time glycobiology has been the cinderella field in life sciences: “an area that involves much work but, does not get to show off at the ball with her cousins, the genomes and proteins” [261]. This has changed dramatically over the last 10 years. Large collections of new glycomics data are available that are ready to be integrated into the large data collections of proteomics and genomics. Bioinformatics standards for glycomics have been established and, in the context of the EUROCarbDB project, strategies and concepts for data sharing have been worked out and initial discussions with bioinformatic groups from the proteomics field have taken place. It has been realized that the topics currently discussed in proteomics on data sharing [262] are very similar to the aims of EUROCarbDB. Therefore, the next steps will be to establish a closer collaboration with bioinformatic groups in proteomics and genomics which will hopefully result in the long-term establishment of glycoinformatic concepts at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) or the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and a bioinformatics center in Japan. In conclusion, bioinformatics for glycomics has evolved beautifully over recent years and is ready to be invited to show up at the ball with proteomics and genomics in order to waltz together."
PMC2924342,"Structural motif screening reveals a novel, conserved carbohydrate-binding surface in the pathogenesis-related protein PR-5d",False,"Aromatic amino acids play a critical role in protein-glycan interactions. Clusters of surface aromatic residues and their features may therefore be useful in distinguishing glycan-binding sites as well as predicting novel glycan-binding proteins. In this work, a structural bioinformatics approach was used to screen the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for coplanar aromatic motifs similar to those found in known glycan-binding proteins.The proteins identified in the screen were significantly associated with carbohydrate-related functions according to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, and predicted motifs were found frequently within novel folds and glycan-binding sites not included in the training set. In addition to numerous binding sites predicted in structural genomics proteins of unknown function, one novel prediction was a surface motif (W34/W36/W192) in the tobacco pathogenesis-related protein, PR-5d. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the surface motif is exclusive to a subfamily of PR-5 proteins from the Solanaceae family of plants, and is absent completely in more distant homologs. To confirm PR-5d's insoluble-polysaccharide binding activity, a cellulose-pulldown assay of tobacco proteins was performed and PR-5d was identified in the cellulose-binding fraction by mass spectrometry.Based on the combined results, we propose that the putative binding site in PR-5d may be an evolutionary adaptation of Solanaceae plants including potato, tomato, and tobacco, towards defense against cellulose-containing pathogens such as species of the deadly oomycete genus, Phytophthora. More generally, the results demonstrate that coplanar aromatic clusters on protein surfaces are a structural signature of glycan-binding proteins, and can be used to computationally predict novel glycan-binding proteins from 3 D structure.Carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBPs) are highly diverse in terms of their sequences, structures, binding sites, and evolutionary histories [1]. Sequence-based classifications (e.g., as used in the CAZy database [2]) are an attempt to organize this diversity, and do so by grouping CBPs into evolutionarily related families and subfamilies. Many of these families have a common function and mechanism, while in others functions have diversified [2]. Prediction of novel CBPs with unique binding sites and mechanisms that are unrelated to known cases is a more difficult task, as there is no single sequence profile or pattern that defines a carbohydrate-binding site. Thus, while sequence-based carbohydrate-binding site prediction methods have been shown to be moderately successful, structural information will be key to achieve higher prediction accuracies [3].Structure-based algorithms are a promising approach for prediction and analysis of binding sites in proteins from first principles. Just as sequence profiles and patterns can be used to infer function in uncharacterized sequences, the existence of specific structural patterns in incompletely characterized structures may provide clues into their functions [4,5]. As binding site residues and other functional motifs may be close in 3 D space but be non-contiguous in the amino acid sequence, structural patterns are inherently better at representing proteins functions than primary sequence alone. A number of structure-based approaches have been applied to carbohydrate-binding site prediction, and have achieved reasonable prediction accuracy [6-8]. However, even using structural information, not all carbohydrate-binding sites can be correctly predicted (e.g., false negative rates are roughly 30%). Structure-based prediction of CBPs with novel folds and binding sites has also not been performed and validated experimentally. Given their enormous potential in biotechnological applications [9], computational prediction of novel CBPs is a worthwhile goal.It is unlikely that general feature-detection approaches will be able to identify all types of carbohydrate-binding sites. Carbohydrate ligands are diverse in size, geometry and other physicochemical characteristics [2], and this diversity is mirrored in the features of carbohydrate-binding sites in proteins. A few recent studies have developed more targeted approaches that apply structure-based methods to specific classes of CBPs [10,11]. At a cost of lower generality, approaches that focus on structural motifs of particular functional classes of CBPs may achieve predictions with better ligand specificities and greater overall accuracies.A useful structural and functional classification of CBPs is described by Boraston et al. [1]. Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) were divided into three main types (type A, B and C) based on their structural and functional characteristics, where members of each class are not necessarily related and do not share a common sequence pattern. Type A CBMs, which bind insoluble carbohydrates, possess a unique structural signature of three surface aromatic residues whose side-chains are arranged in a coplanar orientation to dock to a crystalline carbohydrate surface. In the binding sites of type B (glycan-chain binding) CBMs, there are typically two coplanar aromatic residues which form a ""sandwich"" or ""clamp"" around the glycan ligand. Through hydrophobic stacking (CH-Π) interactions [12,13], aromatic sidechains of Type A and B CBMs bind to their respective glycan ligands, which are polysaccharides or oligosaccharides. Smaller monosaccharides, however, are the targets of type C CBMs, which do not necessarily possess coplanar aromatic motifs. The use of aromatic motifs as structural signatures of CBPs is consistent with computational and experimental analyses of carbohydrate-binding sites. Malik et al. [3], who scored amino acid propensities in known carbohydrate-binding sites, found that Trp is extremely overrepresented (331%). Mutations of aromatic residues such as Trp have also been shown to significantly decrease carbohydrate-binding activities [14-17]. Ultimately, these studies indicate that Trp and Tyr are highly prevalent in carbohydrate-binding sites, while Phe and His are found less frequently. The abundance of Trp is partially due to it having the largest surface area of all amino acids for potential hydrophobic interactions. The relative abundance of Tyr over Phe is explained by the ability of Tyr to form additional H-bonds and electrostatic interactions because of its hydroxyl group. Thus, even within aromatic residues, subtle sidechain differences have the potential to affect carbohydrate-recognition.While binding sites like those found in type C CBMs may be more structurally diverse and thus harder to identify using a structural signature, aromatic motifs found in type A and B CBM binding have the potential to be used as 3 D motifs in structural database screening to identify novel carbohydrate-binding sites [10]. In this work, we expand on a previous 3D-motif approach [10] to perform a comprehensive PDB-wide screen for coplanar aromatic surface motifs. The primary goal is to determine whether such motifs are significantly enriched in carbohydrate-related proteins and can be used to identify novel CBPs and binding sites not found in existing CBP families. A novel prediction (pathogenesis-related protein, PR-5d) is then analyzed computationally and tested experimentally.PR-5d refers to the tobacco pathogenesis-related protein, which is a member of the larger PR-5 family, including the proteins thaumatin and osmotin. Anti-fungal activity has been demonstrated for PR-5d [18] and related PR-5 proteins [19,20], but the structural basis of this activity is still unclear. Membrane pore-formation has been suggested as one possible anti-fungal mechanism [18]. Carbohydrate-binding and hydrolytic functions have also been observed for a number of PR-5 proteins (e.g., ß-1, 3-glucan interactions in thaumatin-like proteins [21,22]). Carbohydrate interactions are consistent with structural modelling studies of PR-5 proteins, which have demonstrated that PR-5 proteins contain highly acidic clefts suitable for carbohydrate hydrolytic function [22,23]. This suggests that the mechanism may involve interactions between PR- 5 proteins and pathogen cell wall carbohydrates. The PR-5d surface motif predicted in this study is therefore of particular interest because pathogen-specific insoluble-carbohydrate binding may represent a previously unknown mechanism by which PR-5d acts on specific pathogens of tobacco and related species. Furthermore, the results of this work highlight a critical surface region on which subtle mutations may underlie important functional novelties in the PR-5 family. In a broader sense, this study highlights the potential of structural motif screening approaches to predict novel functions using large-scale structural data.To determine whether coplanar aromatic surface motifs like those found in type A and B CBMs are structural signatures of glycan-binding proteins, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was applied to a training set of coplanar aromatic motifs occurring in structures of known glycan-binding proteins. Positive cases used in training included 26 pairs of glycan-binding aromatic residues in known type A and B CBM binding sites from 18 different structures (Figure ​(Figure1).1). Negative cases used in training included 140,383 random pairs from the Nh3d reference dataset [24], further filtered to 7,830 pairs by selecting only those whose features were no worse than the worst-case values found in the positive cases (see thresholding section in Methods). This conservative approach is intended to identify and separate putative carbohydrate binding motifs from similar inactive aromatic groups on protein surfaces.Aromatic surface motifs in a training set of type A and B CBMs. Structures of 6 type A and 12 type B CBMs and their glycan-binding aromatic motifs (highlighted in red) and ligands (highlighted in green if present in the PDB structure). PDB ids and aromatic residue pairs used in training are listed for each structure.Based on coplanarity of aromatic sidechains, solvent accessibility, residue type, and distance, LDA was able to effectively separate the two classes based on the input features (Figure ​(Figure2).2). Twenty out of 26 (77%) of the positive cases scored greater than 95% of background scores, and 24 out of 26 (92%) scored greater than 90% of the background scores.LDA-based discrimination of selected aromatic pair motifs in known type A and B CBMs, and reference aromatic pairs from the Nh3d dataset passing the initial thresholds. Four features (distance, ASA, coplanarity, and residue type) were used in the discrimination. Parameter means and LDA statistics are listed on the right.The coefficients of linear discriminants, which provide an indication of the contribution and relationship of each variable to the discrimination, are shown in Figure ​Figure2.2. The signs of each coefficient are as expected; the distance parameter is negative indicating a preference for aromatic pairs in closer proximity; solvent accessibility (asaavg) is positive indicating a preference for greater surface exposure; and theta is negative indicating that lower angles (higher coplanarity) is preferred. The residue-type parameter resscore was the strongest discriminating variable between aromatic motifs found in glycan-binding sites and random, aromatic surface motifs.After parameter fitting, the algorithm was applied to 15,970 non-redundant structures from the nrPDB dataset, with an initial 229,919 aromatic pairs from 15,047 different structures that passed the parameter thresholds. These were screened for pairs that received a raw LDA score greater than the 99th percentile score (~3.40) of all sites analyzed in the initial training set. This resulted in 1,304 high-scoring aromatic pairs from a total of 994 unique structures.To determine whether the proteins identified by screening are enriched in carbohydrate-related functions, GO terms for all structures were retrieved using the GOA database [25], and GO terms for proteins identified in the screen (which excluded structures from the training set) were assessed for statistical enrichment using the binomial test (see Methods). Out of 501 total GO associations for proteins in the set of 994 structures identified in the screen, 14 significantly enriched GO terms were detected according to the binomial test with a false-discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple testing [26] and conservative FDR cutoff of 0.05 (Table ​(Table1).1). Nine of these are associated with carbohydrate-related functions (Table ​(Table1).1). For example, out of 380 structures in the nrPDB annotated with GO: 0005975 (""carbohydrate metabolic process""), 95 of these were identified in the screen. Thus, a quarter of the structures with this annotation contain an aromatic pair motif that scores higher than the 99th percentile. Of 48 structures in the nrPDB that contain the term GO: 0030246 (carbohydrate-binding), 17 of these were identified. This is equivalent to a four-fold enrichment (p ~ 1.57e-29), and over five-fold enrichment (p ~ 1.9e-08) in carbohydrate metabolism and binding functions, respectively. When the screening threshold score is lowered, a larger proportion of structures from these GO categories are identified, but at the expense of more false positives. For example, 40, 31, and 24 of the 48 carbohydrate-binding structures were identified when searching for motifs scoring greater than the 75th, 90th, and 95th percentile scores, respectively. This demonstrates that many carbohydrate-binding proteins not identified in the top 99th percentile screen also possess similar aromatic motifs that are simply lower-scoring.Enriched GO functions in structures identified by motif screening.For some apparently enriched terms not directly related to carbohydrate-binding (e.g., 'cation-binding'), these terms are commonly linked with carbohydrate-related enzymes and thus exhibit significant enrichment in the dataset. For example, 1LWJ (T. Maritima 4-alpha-glucanotransferase/acarbose complex), is tagged with GO: 0005975 (carbohydrate metabolic process) as well as GO: 0003824 (catalytic activity), and GO: 0043169 (cation binding). All three of these terms showed significant enrichment (Table ​(Table11).Representative examples of several correctly identified glycan-binding sites in structures not included in the training set are shown in Figure ​Figure33 (top panel). In the selected structures, predicted aromatic motifs with raw LDA scores > 99th percentile have been highlighted along with their corresponding bound glycan. Each predicted binding site and most of the folds are unique, and the aromatic motifs have in these cases have arisen independently through convergent evolution.Selected binding site predictions obtained by PDB screening. Correctly identified binding motifs found in known glycan-binding proteins (top panel); novel predictions occurring in structural genomics proteins whose functions are unknown or incompletely characterized (bottom panel).Also shown are 17 predicted aromatic-motif binding sites occurring in structural genomics proteins whose functions are incompletely characterized or unknown (Figure ​(Figure3,3, bottom panel). While carbohydrates/glycans are likely targets of the predicted motifs, they may also be binding sites for other ligands (e.g., some nucleotide-binding sites also consist of an aromatic sandwich motif).The detected motifs are similar to those found in type A and B CBMs, and are predominantly Trp-rich coplanar strip or sandwich motifs. All examples shown in Figure ​Figure33 contain Trp/Trp motifs, as this was the most highly scored residue combination and thus occurs most frequently in the top percentile of scoring. All of the structural genomics proteins shown have different folds from the structures in the training set, with one exception. PDB ID 3hnm (a domain from a putative chitobiase) structurally aligned well with the CBM 22 xylan-binding domain (1dyo) according to VAST (E-value = 0.0453) [27], but has very a low sequence identity (5.2%) to this protein.In several of these cases, sequence or structural similarities also support the possibility of carbohydrate-binding functions. PDB ID 1u9c is in the same SCOP superfamily ('Class I glutamine amidotransferase-like') as A4 beta-galactosidase middle domain (PDB ID 1kwk). A BLAST search of 2i9i detected similarity to ""neuraminyllactose-binding hemagglutinin"" proteins (e.g., PDB ID 3bgh). PDB ID 2b06 has a nudix fold also found in GDP-mannose mannosyl hydrolase NudD (e.g., PDB ID 1rya). PDB ID 1pbj has a CBS-domain pair fold, and a similar site in PDB ID 2rif binds AMP. Lastly, 3cbw is a structure of beta-mannanase BsMan26A from Bacillus subtilis [28].The motifs shown in Figure ​Figure33 were identified using an LDA score threshold equivalent to the 99th percentile score. However, it is important to note that other known and candidate carbohydrate-binding structures had motifs scoring below this threshold. For example, the structural genomics proteins, PDB ID 3e5z (a putative gluconolactonase; predicted residues: W29, Y135) and PDB ID 3dsm (B. uniformis surface layer protein; predicted residues: W117, W162, Y207, W240, Y284, Y303) are likely to interact with carbohydrates and had predicted binding sites scoring highly (>95% score) but below the threshold.One of the top predictions was a surface motif in the pathogenesis-related protein PR-5d from tobacco. The putative binding site in PR-5d received a raw LDA score of ~3.80 (99.6th percentile) for the W34/W36 pair, ~3.69 (99.5th percentile) for the W36/W196 pair, and ~3.15 (98.6th percentile) for the W34/W196 pair. Thus, the motifs in PR-5d received extremely high scores, scoring higher than many of the glycan-binding sites from the training set. Compared to all proteins in the nrPDB analyzed in screening, this putative binding site had scores greater than 99.7% of cases.The crystal structure of tobacco PR-5d (PDB ID 1aun) is shown in Figure ​Figure4A.4A. The predicted binding site in PR-5d comprises three Trp residues (W34, W36, W196), which form a highly coplanar and accessible surface region reminiscent of coplanar aromatic surface motifs found in the binding sites of type A CBMs (Figure ​(Figure1).1). It forms a separate and distinct surface patch from the putative active site cleft (Figure ​(Figure4A4A).A predicted binding-site in PR-5d and experimental validation of PR-5d insoluble-carbohydrate binding activity using a cellulose pulldown assay and mass spectrometry. (A) The predicted Trp-rich binding surface in tobacco antifungal protein, PR-5d (PDB ID 1aun). A surface representation is also shown to illustrate the hydrolytic cleft region, which is distinct from the predicted binding site. (B) A silver stained gel of purified cellulose-binding proteins from tobacco (left). The marked band was excised from the corresponding position on a coomassie stained gel and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). MS sequencing identified two peptides matching the PR-5d sequence. MS statistics and sequence information is shown to the right of the gel, where CamC represents carbamidomethyl derivatives of cysteine residues.In addition to PR-5d, only 51 other structures out of 15,970 (< 0.3%) were found to contain type A CBM-like triplets with scores greater or equal to that of PR-5d. Such binding sites composed of three or more coplanar aromatic motifs were identified by grouping together pairs of high-scoring coplanar aromatics that share a common residue.Given previous associations between the hydrolytic cleft and glycan binding [21-23], it is possible that motifs within or near the hydrolytic cleft of PR-5d also contribute to cellulose binding. In addition to W34/W36/W196, a weaker scoring pair was detected near the hydrolytic cleft (F91 and F96). This site received an LDA score of 0.505, placing it in the 86th percentile of all scores. Though this site and other motifs in the hydrolytic cleft are suitable for binding glycan chains, they do not possess the common pattern of type A CBM binding sites, and are much less likely to be capable of binding to a crystalline-cellulose surface.The structural analysis indicates that PR-5d possesses a significant structural signature of carbohydrate-binding proteins, the W34/W36/W196 motif that is similar to insoluble-carbohydrate binding motifs found in known type A CBMs. Thus, the binding activity of PR-5d towards insoluble cellulose was tested experimentally using a cellulose pulldown assay of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacam) proteins, followed by mass spectrometry. A similar experiment performed with insoluble chitin was also performed in a previous study, which identified a chitinase CBM but not PR-5d [10]. Tobacco plants were first treated with salt in order to cause an ethylene-induced stress response in order to induce PR-5d gene expression (previously shown in Sato et al. [29]) and obtain a larger PR-5d yield than that expected under normal conditions. In the cellulose-pulldown assay, tobacco protein extract was mixed with insoluble cellulose, and the mixture was washed stringently in order to remove non-cellulose-binding proteins and purify only proteins with strong binding activity towards insoluble cellulose. The cellulose-binding fraction was then analyzed with SDS-PAGE, stained with both coomassie and silver stain, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The stringent conditions resulted in several faint bands on the coomassie stained gel, which were more easily visualized using silver stain (Figure ​(Figure4B).4B). A band at the expected size (~23 kDa) of PR-5d was present, which was then excised and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). MS analysis identified two peptides, which were identified as the top-scoring match to the sequence of the tobacco PR-5d protein (Figure ​(Figure4B).4B). The identification of PR-5d in the cellulose-binding fraction demonstrates that PR-5d has insoluble-cellulose-binding activity and validates the computational prediction.To further support the functional importance of the cellulose-binding motif, patterns of residue conservation across species were investigated. Close homologs of PR-5d were retrieved via a BLAST search of the NCBI nr protein database and a multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree was constructed. The predicted aromatic motif residues and corresponding residues from other related PR-5 proteins were then mapped onto the phylogeny in order to phylogenetically trace the origin of the W34/W36/W196 motif in PR-5d.Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PR-5d is a member of a highly conserved clade of PR-5 proteins exclusive to the Solanaceae family of plants including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), potato (S. tuberosum), chili pepper (Capsicum annuum), and several species of tobacco (N. tabacum) (Figure ​(Figure5).5). This clade of PR-5d proteins, extremely well supported by a bootstrap value of 98/100, all share the W34/W36/W196 motif, which is not present anywhere else in the phylogeny (Figure ​(Figure5).5). The 100% conservation indicates the functional importance of this clade-defining motif, and suggests it may be a potential evolutionary and functional determinant of this group of Solanaceae PR-5 proteins.Phylogenetic analysis of PR-5d and the W34/W36/W196 aromatic surface motif. The tree of PR-5d and related proteins is a subtree from a larger neighbor-joining tree of PR-5 related proteins. Bootstrap values are indicated for two key clades. The residues in alignment positions 34, 36, and 196 (relative to the PR-5d sequence) have been mapped onto the tree, and demonstrate that the conserved putative binding site (W34/W36/W196) likely originated in an ancestral PR-5d protein in an ancestral species of the Solanaeceae family. The scale bar indicates units of number of amino acid substitutions per site.Solanaceae plants are common targets of the deadly plant pathogen, Phytophthora (Greek for ""plant-destroyer""). The clade-defining, putative binding site towards insoluble-polysaccharides in the plant-defense protein, PR-5d, may be an evolutionary adaptation towards defense against Phytophthora. Unlike fungi, which are commonly studied targets of PR-5 proteins, a distinguishing feature of Phytophthora infestans and other oomycetes is that they possess a cell wall containing insoluble cellulose [30,31]. Previous studies have shown that PR-5 related proteins such as tobacco osmotin are active against Phytophthora infestans [19,32]. According to the tree, tobacco osmotin and related osmotin-like proteins are indeed the most closely related sequences to the PR-5d subfamily (several of these proteins are labelled in Figure ​Figure5).5). The occurrence of the W34/W36/W196 motif may therefore represent a functional innovation in response to Phytophthora invasion and infection, providing additional indirect support for the mechanistic importance of this motif.Through this work, it has been shown that key features of surface aromatic motifs (residue type, distance, solvent-accessibility, and coplanarity) can be used to structurally distinguish known and novel glycan-binding proteins and their binding sites from random protein structures. This provides further support for approaches that use physicochemical and geometric features of protein surfaces to analyze and predict specific protein functions [33-35]. By performing a large-scale screen of the PDB using the 3 D pattern, existing carbohydrate-binding sites were correctly predicted as well as novel motifs in structural genomics proteins of unknown function. In addition, aromatic surface motifs were found to be significantly associated with carbohydrate-related functions. A high-scoring prediction (PR-5d) was studied structurally, phylogenetically and experimentally. The combined results suggest that the W34/W36/W196 surface motif in PR-5d may function as an insoluble-polysaccharide binding site that targets polysaccharides such as cellulose in pathogen cell walls. A likely target is the major plant pathogen, Phytophthora, which has a cell wall made of cellulose, and which commonly infects the Solanaceae species in which the PR-5d W34/W36/W196 motif is present.Type A and B CBMs: Representative structures of six type A CBMs and 12 type B CBMs were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), yielding a total of 17 diverse carbohydrate-binding structures. All structures have distinct folds or low pairwise sequence identity (BLASTp E-values greater than 0.01). Type A CBMs included 1cbh (CBM1), 1exg (CBM2), 1nbc (CBM3), 1aiw (CBM5), 1e8r (CBM10), and 2bh0, a recently solved structure of a bacterial expansin with similarity to plant beta-expansins (group 1 grass pollen allergens). This structure also has a binding site and activity analogous to type A CBMs [36]. Type B CBMs included 2xbd (CBM2), 1gui (CBM4), 1uxx (CBM6), 1gny (CBM15), 1j84 (CBM17), 1ac0 (CBM20), 1dyo (CBM22), 1of4 (CBM27), 1uww (CBM28), 1gwk (CBM29), 1uh2 (CBM34), and 1ux7 (CBM36). These structures were selected based on the scheme presented in Boraston et al. [1], a comprehensive review on CBMs.Nh3d reference dataset: The Nh3d version 3.0 dataset [24] was retrieved for use as the reference dataset. This dataset contains 806 structurally dissimilar protein chains from the PDB, and was built using the hierarchical CATH database classification. Nh3d was chosen because it was carefully constructed to contain structurally dissimilar protein chains without recognizable common ancestry, and so it lends itself to statistical, structural analysis. In addition, none of the proteins in this dataset are closely related (as determined through BLAST searches) to the sequences in the type A and B CBM dataset. nrPDB: For the purposes of screening, a large non-redundant database of 15,970 PDB structures was generated by retrieving a precomputed list of structures from the PISCES server [37]. The percentage identity cutoff was 90%, the resolution cutoff was 3.0 Å, and all R-factors were allowed. Homologs of the type A and B CBM structures were not included in this dataset.Aromatic residue pairs were selected within known structures from the type A and B CBM dataset based on previous literature and manual inspection (aromatic pairs listed in Figure ​Figure1).1). For type B CBMs, one pair of aromatic residues was used to describe a single ligand-binding site, and for type A CBMs composed of three aromatic residues, the two pairs with the shortest inter-residue distance were used. As a comparison reference dataset containing random protein structures, the Nh3D dataset was used. All aromatic pairs passing initial parameter thresholds (identical to those later described in Screening) were selected, and assumed as non-binding-sites for algorithm training.Four key features (coplanarity, residue type, solvent-accessibility, and distance) were computed for all pairs of aromatic residues (Trp, Tyr, Phe, His) and used in a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in an attempt to discriminate the known sites from the random sites (background). LDA generated a scoring function based on a linear combination of the input variables, that best separates the two classes of data. The linear discriminant function can be represented as:Here, Zip are the values of the discriminating variables; Bp are the coefficients; and Di is the score for the ith data point (in this case, putative binding site). We used the raw LDA score in subsequent searches for novel binding sites. The following features were used to train the parameters in LDA:Coplanarity: measured as the angle (0 to 90 degrees) between the normal vectors of both aromatic rings).Residue type: The score of each residue pair was set to the frequency of the pair plus a pseudocount of 0.5 (except for Phe because Phe was not observed at all). The scores for each residue pair were divided by the sum of total scores, resulting in (Trp/Trp = 0.431; Trp/Tyr = 0.293; Tyr/Tyr = 0.155; Trp/His = 0.052; His/His = 0.017; Any/Phe = 0).Distance: the Euclidean distance, sqrt[(x2-x1)2+(y2-y1)2+(z2-z1)2], between the centroids [(x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2)] of each aromatic ring.Solvent accessibility: the solvent accessible surface area (ASA) was calculated from a Voronoi tessellation [38]. To account for differences in inherent sidechain solvent accessibility between different aromatic residues, each value was divided by the maximum observed in the background dataset for that residue. The average relative ASA value of the two aromatic sidechains was then used as a final feature.Screening: In the screening phase, a separate database of 15,970 non-redundant structures (nrPDB) was screened for potentially novel binding glycan-binding sites and other binding-sites not included in the training set. This involved two steps:1) Thresholding: aromatic pairs with feature values outside the allowed range were removed. The allowed range was simply defined based on the minimum and/or maximum values observed for known binding sites in the training set (6.03 Å ≤ Distance ≤ 21.03 Å, Fractional solvent-accessibility relative to residue type ≥ 0.21, Coplanarity ≤ 83.55 degrees). The ASA cutoff, for instance, removed internal aromatic residues incapable of forming external interactions.2) Scoring: The LDA scoring function was used to score all remaining candidate binding sites. The score of any aromatic pair can be compared to the ""background"" distribution of scores, which reflects its potential for being a glycan- or other type of ligand-binding site.PDB GO annotations were downloaded from the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) database of the European Bioinformatics Institute http://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA. For structures identified by screening, GO term enrichment was tested for all GO categories associated with the identified structures. Binomial exact tests were used to compute the probabilities Pk of observing k or more instances of a particular GO term in the screen (n = 994). Assuming that the background probability p of observing a particular GO term is (total # occurrences/total # structures), the probability Pk is:Since this test was done for all N = 501 GO terms, we used false-discovery rates to correct for multiple statistical tests. The 501 P-values were first ranked in increasing order, and significant p-values were those for which the raw p-value is less than (rank × alpha/N) [26]. An FDR alpha value of 0.05 was used. The fold enrichment (fraction of GO term observed in the screen/fraction of GO terms in all structures) is also reported in Table ​Table11.Ten grams of root tissues from 3-week old tobacco plants were ground with liquid nitrogen and homogenized with 10 mL of extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton-X100). The suspension was sonicated 3 × 30 seconds with 30-second pauses between pulses at 200-300 W. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10000 × g at 4°C for 10 minutes. A protein concentration of 1 μg/μL was determined using the Bradford assay. 0.5 grams of Avicel® microcrystalline cellulose (~1 mL) that was purified from fibrous plants (FMC Corporation, Newark, DE) was equilibrated with 10 mL of extraction buffer. The whole 10 mL of lysate was then mixed with the equilibrated cellulose and incubated at 4°C for 3 hours. The mixture was applied to a Poly-Prep® chromatography column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Loosely bound proteins were removed by washing with 30 mL (~30 column volumes) of extraction buffer. The cellulose-binding proteins were eluted with 4 × 1 mL of 0.1% SDS, and the eluate was collected as the cellulose-binding fraction.The cellulose-binding fraction was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie blue G-250 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The strongest bands were excised and digested with trypsin as previously described [39]. The peptides were extracted from gel pieces by vortexing and dried in a SpeedVac (Instruments Inc., Hicksville, NY). The peptides were resuspended in 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Mass spectrometry was performed on an Applied Biosystems Q-TRAP system. Peak lists were generated and processed using Analyst software version 1.4.1 (Applied Biosystems). The protein was identified using PEAKS version 4.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, ON). The parental and fragment mass error are 0.2 Da and 0.1 Da, respectively. Fragments were predicted based on digestion with trypsin (one missed cleavage site allowed) and carbamidomethylation and methionine oxidation as fixed and variable modifications, respectively.As the Coomassie gel produced faint bands, a second SDS-PAGE gel was prepared and silver stained. The silver staining procedure was followed by the instruction of the PlusOne Protein Silver Staining Kit from GE Healthcare (cat # 17-1150-01).A BLAST search of tobacco PR-5d (PDB ID 1aun) was used to identify related sequences. All sequences with E < 0.001 that aligned to the query with sequence coverage > 90% were used to build a second alignment using MUSCLE [40]. Conserved regions of the alignment were used to generate a midpoint-rooted neighbor-joining tree using Seaview [41]. A major clade of PR-5d proteins containing the PR-5d subclade was then selected for further analysis.ACD and BJM conceived and designed the study, and ACD carried out the computational analyses. BAM assisted with design of experiments and techniques for isolation of plant proteins. ZC performed the affinity purification assay and mass spectrometry analysis. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.This work is supported by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) through grants to BJM, and a Canada Graduate Scholarship (CGS) to ACD.

PMC2926784,Genome sequence of the necrotrophic plant pathogen Pythium ultimum reveals original pathogenicity mechanisms and effector repertoire,False,"Pythium ultimum is a ubiquitous oomycete plant pathogen responsible for a variety of diseases on a broad range of crop and ornamental species.The P. ultimum genome (42.8 Mb) encodes 15,290 genes and has extensive sequence similarity and synteny with related Phytophthora species, including the potato blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Whole transcriptome sequencing revealed expression of 86% of genes, with detectable differential expression of suites of genes under abiotic stress and in the presence of a host. The predicted proteome includes a large repertoire of proteins involved in plant pathogen interactions, although, surprisingly, the P. ultimum genome does not encode any classical RXLR effectors and relatively few Crinkler genes in comparison to related phytopathogenic oomycetes. A lower number of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were present compared to Phytophthora species, with the notable absence of cutinases, suggesting a significant difference in virulence mechanisms between P. ultimum and more host-specific oomycete species. Although we observed a high degree of orthology with Phytophthora genomes, there were novel features of the P. ultimum proteome, including an expansion of genes involved in proteolysis and genes unique to Pythium. We identified a small gene family of cadherins, proteins involved in cell adhesion, the first report of these in a genome outside the metazoans.Access to the P. ultimum genome has revealed not only core pathogenic mechanisms within the oomycetes but also lineage-specific genes associated with the alternative virulence and lifestyles found within the pythiaceous lineages compared to the Peronosporaceae.Pythium is a member of the Oomycota (also referred to as oomycetes), which are part of the heterokont/chromist clade [1,2] within the 'Straminipila-Alveolata-Rhizaria' superkingdom [3]. Recent phylogenies based on multiple protein coding genes indicate that the oomycetes, together with the uniflagellate hyphochytrids and the flagellates Pirsonia and Developayella, form the sister clade to the diverse photosynthetic orders in the phylum Ochrophyta [2,4]. Therefore, the genomes of the closest relatives to Pythium outside of the oomycetes available to date would be those of the diatoms Thalassiosira [5] and Phaeodactylum [6], and the phaeophyte algae Ectocarpus [7].Pythium is a cosmopolitan and biologically diverse genus. Most species are soil inhabitants, although some reside in saltwater estuaries and other aquatic environments. Most Pythium spp. are saprobes or facultative plant pathogens causing a wide variety of diseases, including damping-off and a range of field and post-harvest rots [8-12]. Pythium spp. are opportunistic plant pathogens that can cause severe damage whenever plants are stressed or at a vulnerable stage. Some species have been used as biological control agents for plant disease management whereas others can be parasites of animals, including humans [13-15]. The genus Pythium, as currently defined, contains over a hundred species, with most having some loci sequenced for phylogeny [16]. Pythium is placed in the Peronosporales sensu lato, which contains a large number of often diverse taxa in which two groups are commonly recognized, the paraphyletic Pythiaceae, which comprise the basal lineages of the second group, the Peronosporaceae.The main morphological feature that separates Pythium lineages from Phytophthora lineages is the process by which zoospores are produced from sporangia. In Phytophthora, zoospore differentiation happens directly within the sporangia, a derived character or apomorphism for Phytophthora. In Pythium, a vesicle is produced within which zoospore differentiation occurs [12]; this is considered the ancestral or plesiomorphic state. There is a much wider range of sporangial shapes in Pythium than is found in Phytophthora (see [17] for more detailed comparison). Biochemically, Phytophthora spp. have lost the ability to synthesize thiamine, which has been retained in Pythium and most other oomycetes. On the other hand, elicitin-like proteins are abundant in Phytophthora but in Pythium they have been mainly found in the species most closely related to Phytophthora [18-20]. Many Phytophthora spp. have a rather narrow plant species host range whereas there is little host specificity in plant pathogenic Pythium species apart from some preference shown for either monocot or dicot hosts. Gene-for-gene interactions and the associated cultivar/race differential responses have been described for many Phytophthora and downy mildew species with narrow host ranges. In constrast, such gene-for-gene interactions or cultivar/race differentials have never been observed in Pythium, although single dominant genes were associated with resistance in maize and soybean against Pythium inflatum and Pythium aphanidermatum, respectively [21,22], and in common bean against P. ultimum var. ultimum (G Mahuku, personal communication). Lastly, in the necrotroph to biotroph spectrum, some Pythium spp. are necrotrophs whereas others behave as hemibiotrophs like Phytophthora spp. [23].P. ultimum is a ubiquitous plant pathogen and one of the most pathogenic Pythium spp. on crop species [13]. It does not require another mating type for sexual reproduction as it is self-fertile - that is, homothallic - but outcrossing has been reported [24]. P. ultimum is separated into two varieties: P. ultimum var. ultimum is the most common and pathogenic group and produces oospores but very rarely sporangia and zoospores, whereas P. ultimum var. sporangiiferum is a rare and less pathogenic group that produces both oospores and sporangia [12]. The isolate (DAOM BR144 = CBS 805.95 = ATCC 200006) reported in this study belongs to P. ultimum var. ultimum and was found to be the most representative strain [16,25,26]. We use P. ultimum to refer to P. ultimum var. ultimum unless stated otherwise.In this study, we report on the generation and analysis of the full genome sequence of P. ultimum DAOM BR144, an isolate obtained from tobacco. The genomes of several plant pathogenic oomycetes have been sequenced, including three species of Phytophthora (Ph. infestans, Ph. sojae, and Ph. ramorum [27,28]), allowing the identification and improved understanding of pathogenicity mechanisms of these pathogens, especially with respect to the repertoire of effector molecules that govern the outcome of the plant-pathogen interaction [27-30]. To initially assess the gene complement of P. ultimum, we generated a set of ESTs using conventional Sanger sequencing coupled with 454 pyrosequencing of P. ultimum (DAOM BR144) hyphae grown in rich and nutrient-starved conditions [31]. These transcriptome sequence data were highly informative and showed that P. ultimum shared a large percentage of its proteome with related Phytophthora spp. In this study, we report on the sequencing, assembly, and annotation of the P. ultimum DAOM BR144 genome. To gain insight into gene function, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing under eight growth conditions, including a range of abiotic stresses and in the presence of a host. While the P. ultimum genome has similarities to related oomycete plant pathogens, its complement of metabolic and effector proteins is tailored to its pathogenic lifestyle as a necrotroph.Using a hybrid strategy that coupled deep Sanger sequencing of variable insert libraries with pyrosequencing, we generated a high quality draft sequence of the oomycete pathogen P. ultimum (DAOM BR144 = CBS 805.95 = ATCC 200006). With an N50 contig length of 124 kb (1,747 total) and an N50 scaffold length of 773,464 bp (975 total), the P. ultimum assembly represents 42.8 Mb of assembled sequence. Additional metrics on the genome are available in Additional file 1.P. ultimum, Ph. sojae and Ph. ramorum differ in mating behaviour: P. ultimum and Ph. sojae are homothallic while Ph. ramorum is heterothallic. The outcrossing preference in Ph. ramorum is reflected in the 13,643 single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in this species versus 499 found in the inbreeding Ph. sojae [27]. Although the Ph. sojae genome size is twice that of P. ultimum, a large number (11,916) of variable bases (that is, high quality reads in conflict with the consensus) were present within the DAOM BR144 assembly, indicating that the in vitro outcrossing reported for P. ultimum [24] might be common in nature.The final genome annotation set (v4) contained 15,297 genes encoding 15,329 transcripts (15,323 protein coding and 6 rRNA coding) due to detection of alternative splice forms. Global analysis of the intron/exon structure revealed that while there are examples of intron-rich genes in the P. ultimum genome, the majority of genes tend to have few introns, with an average 1.6 introns occurring per gene that are relatively short (average intron length 115 bp), consistent with that of Ph. infestans (1.7 introns per gene, 124 bp average intron length). Coding exons in the P. ultimum genome tend to be relatively long when compared to other eukaryotes [32-40], having an average length of 498 bp, with 38.9% of the P. ultimum genes encoded by a single exon. This is comparable to that observed in P. infestans, in which the average exon is 456 bp with 33.1% encoding single exon genes.In eukaryotic genomes such as that of Arabidopsis thaliana and human, 79% and 77% of all genes contain an InterPro domain, respectively. In comparison, only 60% of all P. ultimum genes contain an InterPro protein domain, which is comparable to that observed with Phytophthora spp. (55 to 66%). This is most likely attributable to the higher quality annotation of the human and Arabidopsis proteomes and, potentially, the lack of representation of oomycetes in protein databases.Earlier transcriptome work with strain DAOM BR144 involved Sanger and 454 pyrosequencing of a normalized cDNA library constructed from two in vitro growth conditions [31]. When mapped to the DAOM BR144 genome, these ESTs (6,903 Sanger- and 21,863 454-assembled contigs) aligned with 10,784 gene models, providing expression support for 70.5% of the gene set. To further probe the P. ultimum transcriptome and to aid in functional annotation, we employed mRNA-Seq [41] to generate short transcript reads from eight growth/treatment conditions. A total of 71 million reads (2.7 Gb) were mapped to the DAOM BR144 genome and 11,685 of the 15,297 loci (76%) were expressed based on RNA-Seq data. Collectively, from the Sanger, 454, and Illumina transcriptome sequencing in which eight growth conditions, including host infection, were assayed, transcript support was detected for 13,103 genes of the 15,291 protein coding genes (85.7%). When protein sequence similarity to other annotated proteins is coupled with all available transcript support, only 190 of the 15,291 protein coding genes lack either transcript support or protein sequence similarity (Table S1 in Additional file 2).In total, 12,815 repeat elements were identified in the genome (Table S2 in Additional file 2). In general, the relatively low repeat content of the P. ultimum genome (approximately 7% by length) is similar to what would be expected for small, rapidly reproducing eukaryotic organisms [42,43]. While the repeat content is much lower than that of the oomycete Ph. infestans [28], the difference is likely due to the presence of DNA methylases identified by protein domain analyses in the P. ultimum genome, which have been shown to inhibit repeat expansion [44]. Interestingly, the oomycete Ph. infestans lacks DNA methylase genes, the absence of which is believed to contribute to repeat element expansion within that organism, with repeats making up > 50% of the genome [27,28,45].The P. ultimum DAOM BR144 mitochondrial genome is 59,689 bp and contains a large inverted repeat (21,950 bp) that is separated by small (2,711 bp) and large (13,078 bp) unique regions (Figure S1 in Additional file 3). The P. ultimum DAOM BR144 mitochondrion encodes the same suite of protein coding (35), rRNA (2), and tRNA (encoding 19 amino acids) genes present in other oomycetes such as Phytophthora and Saprolegnia [46-48]. However, the number of copies is different due to the large inverted repeat as well as some putative ORFs that are unique to P. ultimum (Additional file 1). No insertions of the mitochondrial genome into the nuclear genome were identified.Comparative genome analyses can reveal important differences between P. ultimum and the Peronosporaceae that may contribute to their respective lifestyles, that is, the non-host specific P. ultimum and the host specific Phytophthora spp. We utilized two approaches to probe the nature of gene complements within these two clades of oomycetes. First, using the generalized approach of examining PANTHER protein families [49], we identified major lineage-specific expansions of gene families. Second, through targeted analysis of subsets of the P. ultimum proteome, including the secretome, effectors, proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and pathogen/microbial-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs; for review see [50]), we revealed commonalities, as well as significant distinct features, of P. ultimum in comparison to Phytophthora spp.Several families involved in proteolysis were over-represented in P. ultimum compared to Phytophthora spp. (Table ​(Table1).1). This is primarily due to a massive expansion of subtilisin-related proteases (PTHR10795) in P. ultimum following the divergence from ancestors of Phytophthora. With regard to the total complement of serine proteases, the subtilisin family expansion in P. ultimum is somewhat counterbalanced by the trypsin-related serine protease family, which has undergone more gene duplication events in the Phytophthora lineage than the Pythium lineage. The metalloprotease M12 (neprolysin-related) family has also undergone multiple expansions, from one copy in the stramenopile most recent common ancestor, to three in the oomycete most recent common ancestor (and extant Phytophthora), then up to 12 in P. ultimum (data not shown).Major lineage-specific gene family expansions leading to differences in the P. ultimum gene complement compared to PhytophthoraE3 ligases are responsible for substrate specificity of ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis, and secreted E3 ligases have been shown to act as effectors for pathogens by targeting host response proteins for degradation [51,52]. The HECT E3 family of ubiquitin-protein ligases (PTHR11254) apparently underwent at least two major expansions, one in the oomycete lineage after the divergence from diatoms and another in the P. ultimum lineage (Figure S2 in Additional file 3; Table ​Table1).1). Most of the expansion in the P. ultimum lineage appears to be derived from repeated duplication of only two genes that were present in the Pythium-Phytophthora common ancestor. This expanded subfamily is apparently orthologous to the UPL1 and UPL2 genes from A. thaliana. Of the 56 predicted HECT E3 ligases in the P. ultimum genome (that had long enough sequences for phylogenetic analysis), 16 are predicted by SignalP [53] to have bona fide signal peptides, and another 10 have predicted signal anchors, a substantially larger number than reported for other oomycete genomes [54].Several gene families are significantly under-represented in the P. ultimum genome compared to Phytophthora (Table ​(Table1)1) and it appears that these are mostly due to expansions in the Phytophthora lineage rather than losses in the Pythium lineage, though the relatively long distance to the diatom outgroup makes this somewhat uncertain. These include the aquaporin family (PTHR19139), the phospholipase D family (PTHR18896; Additional file 1), four families/subfamilies of intracellular serine-threonine protein kinases, and three families involved in sulfur metabolism (sulfatases (PTHR10342), cysteine desulfurylases (PTHR11601) and sulfate transporters (PTHR11814)).As oomycete plant pathogens secrete a variety of proteins to manipulate plant processes [30,55], we predicted and characterized in detail the soluble secreted proteins of P. ultimum. The secretome of P. ultimum was identified by predicting secreted proteins using the PexFinder algorithm [56] in conjunction with the TribeMCL protein family clustering algorithm. The P. ultimum secretome is composed of 747 proteins (4.9% of the proteome) that can be clustered into 195 families (each family contains at least 2 sequences) and 127 singletons (Table S3 in Additional file 2; selected families are shown in Figure S3 in Additional file 3). Of these, two families and one singleton encode transposable-element-related proteins that were missed in the repeat masking process. The largest family contains 77 members, mostly ankyrin repeat containing proteins, of which only 3 were predicted to have a signal peptide. Notable families of secreted proteins include protease inhibitors (serine and cysteine), NPP1-like proteins (toxins), cellulose-binding elicitor lectin (CBEL)-like proteins with carbohydrate binding domains, elicitins and elicitin-like proteins, secreted E3 ubiquitin ligases (candidate effectors), cell-wall degrading enzymes, lipases, phospholipases, potential adhesion proteins, highly expanded families of proteases and cytochrome P450 (Table ​(Table2),2), and several families of 'unknown' function. A subset (88 proteins) of the secretome showed exclusive similarity to fungal sequences yet are absent in other eukaryotes (Table S4 in Additional file 2; see Table S1 in [57] for a list of organisms). These may represent shared pathogenicity proteins for filamentous plant pathogens, such as peroxidases (Family 68), CBEL-like proteins (Family 8), and various cell wall degrading enzymes and other hydrolases.Protein families implicated in plant pathogenesis: P. ultimum versus Phytophthora spp. or diatomsaData from manual curation/analyses. bData from PANTHER family analyses (MEROPS classification). cData from CAZy. dData from analysis of TRIBEMCL families. ND, not determined.Many plant pathogens, especially biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic ones, produce effector proteins that either enter into host cells or are predicted to do so [27,58,59]. The genomes of Ph. sojae, Ph. ramorum and Ph. infestans encode large numbers (370 to 550) of potential effector proteins that contain an amino-terminal cell-entry domain with the motifs RXLR and dEER [28,29], which mediate entry of these proteins into host cells in the absence of pathogen-encoded machinery [60,61]. RXLR-dEER effectors are thought, and in a few cases shown, to suppress host defense responses, but a subset of these effectors can be recognized by plant immune receptors resulting in programmed cell death and disease resistance. To search for RXLR effectors in the genome of P. ultimum, we translated all six frames of the genome sequence to identify all possible small proteins, exclusive of splicing. Among these, a total of 7,128 translations were found to contain an amino-terminal signal peptide based on SignalP prediction. We then used the RXLR-dEER Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [29] to search the translations for candidate effectors and, as a control, the same set of translations following permutation of their sequences downstream of the signal peptide (Figure ​(Figure1a).1a). Only 35 sequences with significant scores were found in the non-permuted set while an average of 5 were found in 100 different permuted sets. In comparison to the Ph. ramorum secretome, 300 hits were found without permutation. Examination of the 35 significant sequences revealed that most were members of a secreted proteinase family [62] in which the RXLR motif was part of a conserved subtilisin-like serine protease domain of 300 amino acids in length, and thus unlikely to be acting as a cell entry motif. A string search was then performed for the RXLR motif within the amino terminus of each translation, 30 to 150 residues from the signal peptide. In this case, the number of hits was not significantly different between the real sequences and the permuted sequences. The same result was obtained with the strings RXLX and RX[LMFY][HKR] (Figure ​(Figure1b).1b). HMMs have been defined to identify carboxy-terminal motifs conserved in about 60% of RXLR-dEER effectors [29,63]. Searching the secretome and the permutated secretome with this HMM also identified no significant numbers of candidate effectors (data not shown). Blast searches with the most conserved Phytophthora effectors likewise produced no hits.An original repertoire of candidate effector proteins in P. ultimum. (a) The number of candidate RXLR effectors estimated by Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches of predicted proteins with amino-terminal signal peptides. The numbers of false positives were derived from HMM searches of the permutated protein sequences. (b) The number of candidate RXLR effectors discovered by motif searching. The search was performed on the total set of six-frame translated ORFs from the genome sequences that encode proteins with an amino-terminal signal peptide. The motif RXLR and two more degenerate motifs, RXLX or RX[LMIFY][HKR], were required to occur within 100 amino acids of the amino termini. (c) The typical architecture of a YxSL[RK] effector candidate inferred from 91 sequences retrieved from P. ultimum, three Phytophthora genomes and A. euteiches. (d) The YxSL[RK] motif is enriched and positionally constrained in secreted proteins in P. ultimum and Phytophthora spp. The top graph compares the abundance of YxSL[RK]-containing proteins among secreted and non-secreted proteins from four oomycete genomes. The middle and bottom graphs show the frequency of the YxSL[RK] motif among non-secreted and secreted proteins, respectively, according to its position in the protein sequence. (e) Cladogram based on the conserved motifs region of the 91YxSL[KR] proteins, showing boostrap support for the main branches.Based on synteny analysis of surrounding genes, a small number of Phytophthora effectors share conserved genomic positions [27]. Synteny analysis (see below) was used to identify the corresponding positions in the P. ultimum genome, but no predicted secreted proteins were found in those positions in the P. ultimum genome. A paucity of predicted RXLR effector sequences was reported previously in the transcriptome of P. ultimum [31]; the one candidate noted in the transcriptome sequence dataset has proven to be a false positive, matching the negative strand of a conserved transporter gene in the genome sequence. Therefore, we conclude that the P. ultimum genome lacks RXLR effectors that are abundant in other oomycetes, although this analysis does not rule out the possible presence of other kinds of effectors (see below). Nonetheless, the lack of RXLR effectors in P. ultimum is consistent with the absence of gene-for-gene interactions, all known instances of which in Phytophthora spp. involve RXLR effectors with avirulence activities.In Phytophthora spp. the Crinkler (crn) gene family encodes a large class of secreted proteins that share a conserved amino-terminal LFLAK domain, which has been suggested to mediate host translocation and is followed by a major recombination site that forms the junction between the conserved amino terminus and diverse carboxy-terminal effector domains [28]. In sharp contrast to the RXLR effectors, the CRN protein family appears conserved in all plant pathogenic oomycete genomes sequenced to date. BLASTP searches of 16 well-defined amino-terminal domains from Ph. infestans against the P. ultimum predicted proteome identified 18 predicted proteins within P. ultimum (BLAST cutoff of 1 × 10-10; Table S5 in Additional file 2). Examination of protein alignments revealed considerable conservation of the P. ultimum LFLAK domain. We used P. ultimum CRN sequence alignments to build an HMM and through HMM searches identified two additional predicted proteins with putative LFLAK-like domains. We assessed the distribution of candidate CRN proteins within P. ultimum families and identified six additional candidates in Family 64. Further examination of candidates confirmed the presence of LFLAK-like domains (Table S5 in Additional file 2). Surprisingly, only 2 (approximately 7.5%) of the 26 predicted CRN proteins were annotated as having signal peptides (Table S5 in Additional file 2). Two additional CRNs (PYU1_T003336 and PYU1_T002270) have SignalP v2.0 HMM scores of 0.89 and 0.76, respectively, which although below our stringent cutoff of 0.9 may still suggest potential signal peptides. Several of the remaining genes have incomplete ORFs and gene models, suggesting a high frequency of CRN pseudogenes as previously noted in Ph. infestans [28]. All 26 amino-terminal regions were aligned to generate a sequence logo. These analyses revealed a conserved LxLYLAR/K motif that is shared amongst P. ultimum CRN proteins (Figure S4 in Additional file 3) and is followed by a conserved WL motif. The LxLYLAR/K motif is closely related to the F/LxLYLALK motif found in Aphanomyces euteiches [64]. Consistent with results obtained in other oomycete genomes, we found that the LxLYLAR/K motif was located between 46 and 64 amino acids after the methionine, followed by a variable domain that ended with a conserved motif at the proposed recombination site (HVLVxxP), reflecting the modular design of CRN proteins in the oomycetes (Figure S4 in Additional file 3). This recombination site, which is characteristic for the DWL domain, was found highly conserved in 11 of the putative P. ultimum CRN genes, consisting of an aliphatic amino acid followed by a conserved histidine, another three aliphatic amino acids, two variable amino acids and a conserved proline. In a phylogenetic analysis, these 11 genes were predominantly placed basal to the validated CRNs from Phytophthora (Figure S5 in Additional file 3). Although the CRN-like genes in Pythium are more divergent than the validated CRNs of Phytophthora (Figure S5 in Additional file 3), both the recombination site and the LxLYLAR/K-motif, which is a modification of the prominent LxLFLAK-motif present in most Phytophthora CRNs, show a significant degree of conservation, highlighting that the CRN family, greatly expanded in Phytophthora [28], had already evolved in the last common ancestor of P. ultimum and Phytophthora.In the absence of obvious proteins with an amino-terminal RXLR motif, we used other known features of effectors to identify candidate effector families in P. ultimum. Ph. infestans RXLR effectors are not only characterized by a conserved amino-terminal translocation domain but also by their occurrence in gene-sparse regions that are enriched in repetitive DNA [28]. Based on the length of the flanking non-coding regions, the distribution of P. ultimum genes is not multimodal as was observed in Ph. infestans (Figure S6 in Additional file 3). However, relative to the rest of the genes, P. ultimum secretome genes more frequently have long flanking non-coding regions (Figure S7 in Additional file 3). In addition, the secretome genes show a higher proportion of closely related paralogs, suggesting recent duplications in P. ultimum (Figure S7 in Additional file 3) and indicating that the secretome genes may have distinct genome organization and evolution as noted in Phytophthora spp. [28,57]. Using genome organization properties to identify families of secreted proteins in P. ultimum that could correspond to novel effector candidates, we sorted the 194 secretome families based on highest rate of gene duplication, longest flanking non-coding region, and lowest similarity to Ph. infestans proteins (see Figure S8 in Additional file 3 for examples). One relatively large family of secreted proteins, Family 3, stood out because it fulfilled the three criteria and included proteins of unknown function. BlastP similarity searches identified similar sequences only in oomycete species (Phytophthora spp. and A. euteiches). Furthermore, of the 44 family members in P. ultimum for which transcripts could be detected, 32 (73%) were induced more than 2-fold during Arabidopsis infection compared to mycelia, with 5 members induced more than 40-fold. In total, we identified a set of 91 predicted secreted proteins with similarity to Family 3 proteins from the various oomycete species (Additional file 4). Multiple alignments of these proteins, along with motif searches, identified a YxSL[RK] amino acid motif (Figure ​(Figure1c).1c). This motif is at least two-fold enriched in secreted proteins compared to non-secreted proteins in four oomycete species (Figure ​(Figure1d).1d). In addition, the YxSL[RK] motif is positionally constrained between positions 61 and 80 in secreted oomycete proteins only (Figure ​(Figure1d).1d). The 91 YxSL[RK] proteins show a modular organization with a conserved amino-terminal region, containing four conserved motifs, followed by a highly variable carboxy-terminal region (Figure ​(Figure1c;1c; Figure S9 in Additional file 3) as reported for other oomycete effectors [30]. Phylogenetic analyses of the YxSL[RK] family revealed four main clades and suggest an expansion of this family in Phytophthora spp. (Figure ​(Figure1e1e).The YxSL[RK] motif appears to be a signature for a novel family of secreted oomycete proteins that may function as effectors. It is intriguing that the YxSL[RK] motif shares some similarity in sequence and position with the canonical RXLR motif, a resemblance increased by the fact that the variable amino acid is a basic amino acid (lysine) in 28 out of the 91 family members. Whether the YxSL[RK] motif defines a host-translocation domain as noted for RXLR effectors remains to be determined.Detection of pathogens through the perception of PAMPs/MAMPs leads to the induction of plant immune responses (for review, see [50]). Oomycetes produce various and specific molecules able to induce defense responses like elicitins (for review, see [65]), but only two oomycete cell-surface proteins containing a MAMP have been characterized: a transglutaminase [66] and a protein named CBEL [67]. Genes encoding both of these cell-surface proteins were detected in P. ultimum (Additional file 1), suggesting that P. ultimum produces typical oomycete MAMPs, which can be efficiently perceived by a wide range of plant species. The occurrence of PAMPs/MAMPs in P. ultimum suggests that this pathogen must have evolved mechanisms to evade PAMP-triggered immunity. This could occur through a necrotrophic mechanism of infection or using the candidate effector proteins described above.A total of 180 candidate glycoside hydrolases (GHs) were identified in P. ultimum using the CAZy annotation pipeline [68]. This number is apparently similar to those reported previously for Ph. ramorum (173), Ph. sojae (190), and Ph. infestans (157) [27,28]. However, when the CAZy annotation pipeline was applied to Ph. sojae, Ph. ramorum and Ph. infestans, 301, 258 and 277 GHs were found, respectively, nearly twice the number present in P. ultimum (Table ​(Table2).2). Among these we identified putative cellulases belonging to families GH5, GH6 and GH7. All six GH6 candidate cellulases harbor secretion signals. Only one GH6 protein contains a CBEL domain at the carboxyl terminus. Three contain a transmembrane domain and one contains a glycosylphosphatidylinisotol anchor, features suggesting that these proteins may be targeting the oomycete cell wall rather than plant cell walls. The P. ultimum strain studied here could not grow when cellulose was the sole carbon source (Table ​(Table3;3; Figure S10 in Additional file 3).Growth comparison of P. ultimum DAOM BR 144 on different carbon sources and the pH of the medium after 7 daysThe symbols indicate poor growth (+), moderate growth (++), good growth (+++), very good growth (++++), or growth less than or equal to the no-carbon medium (-). The data are the average of the two duplicates used for this experiment.Cutinases are a particular set of esterases (CAZy family CE5) that cleave cutin, a polyester composed of hydroxy and hydroxyepoxy fatty acids that protects aerial plant organs. No candidate cutinases could be found in the P. ultimum genome. Cutinase activity was reported in culture filtrates of P. ultimum, but its growth was not supported on apple cutin [69] and low levels of fatty acid esterase were detected in P. ultimum only in 21-day-old culture [70]. The absence of recognizable cutinases suggests these enzymes are not critical for penetration and infection by P. ultimum, which attacks young, non-suberized roots and penetrates tissues indirectly through wounds. This contrasts with the number of putative cutinases identified in several Phytophthora spp. [27,71-73], which presumably promote penetration of leaf and stem tissues that are protected by a thick cuticle or colonization of heavily suberized root and bark tissue.The xylan degrading capacity of P. ultimum appears to be limited, if not totally absent. No members of the GH10 and GH11 families encoding endoxylanases essential for xylan degradation could be found. Furthermore, families involved in the removal of xylan side chains or modifications such as GH67, CE3, and CE5 are absent while families CE1 and CE2 contain only a limited number of members. The lack of significant xylan digestion was confirmed by the absence of growth when xylan was used as a carbon source (Table ​(Table3;3; Figure S10 in Additional file 3), consistent with previous work on P. ultimum and other Pythium spp. [70].Pectinases play a key role in infection by Pythium spp. [74]. Twenty-nine candidate pectin/pectate lyases (PL1, PL3 and PL4 families) are present in P. ultimum while the genomes of Phytophthora spp. [27,28] encode even larger PL families (Table ​(Table2).2). In P. ultimum, the set of pectin lyases is complemented by 11 pectin hydrolases from family GH28, several of which having been functionally characterized in various Phytophthora spp. [75-78]. P. ultimum lacks pectin methylesterases as well as genes encoding family GH88 and GH105 enzymes and therefore cannot fully saccharify the products of pectin/pectate lyases, consistent with previous reports of incomplete pectin degradation and little or no galacturonic acid production during P. ultimum infection of bentgrass [79]. The data from the carbon source utilization experiment (Table ​(Table3;3; Figure S10 in Additional file 3) show only limited growth on medium with citrus pectin as the sole carbon source.We also observed that the P. ultimum genome encodes candidate GH13 α-amylases, GH15 glucoamylase and a GH32 invertase, suggesting that plant starch and sucrose are targeted. The growth data confirm these observations, with excellent growth on soluble starch and sucrose (Figure S10 in Additional file 3).The CAZy database also contains enzymes involved in fungal cell wall synthesis and remodeling. Cell walls of oomycetes differ markedly from cell walls of Fungi and consist mainly of glucans containing β-1,3 and β-1,6 linkages and cellulose [80-82]. The P. ultimum genome encodes four cellulose synthases closely related to their orthologs described for Ph. infestans [82]. The genome also specifies a large number of enzyme activities that may be involved in the metabolism of β-1,3- and β-1,6-glucans (Additional file 1), as well as a large set of candidate β-1,3-glucan synthases likely involved in synthesis of cell wall β-glucans and in the metabolism of mycolaminaran, the main carbon storage compound in Phytophthora and Pythium spp. [81,83,84].Metalaxyl and its enantiopure R form mefenoxam have been used widely since the 1980s for the control of plant diseases caused by oomycetes [17,85]. The main mechanism of action of this fungicide is selective inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis by interfering with the activity of the RNA polymerase I complex [86]. P. ultimum DAOM BR144 is sensitive to mefenoxam at concentrations higher than 1 μl/l (data not shown) and 45 genes were expressed five-fold or more when P. ultimum was exposed to it (Table S6 in Additional file 2). Active ABC pump efflux systems are important factors for drug and antifungal resistance in Fungi and oomycetes [87-91]. Although the substrates transported by ABC proteins cannot be predicted on the basis of sequence homology, it is clear that these membrane transporters play a key role in the adaptation to environmental change. Three pleiotropic drug resistance proteins (ABC, subfamily G) were strongly up-regulated (> 27-fold) in response to mefenoxam. These genes arose from a tandem duplication event but remain so similar that it is possible that only one of these genes is actually up-regulated under these conditions due to our inability to uniquely map mRNA-seq reads when there are highly similar paralogs. A fourth gene and a member of the multidrug resistance associated family was also up-regulated more than nine-fold. Notably, the ABC transporters in P. ultimum that were up-regulated are distinct from those that were up-regulated in Ph. infestans in response to metalaxyl [92], indicating that a unique set of ABC transporters may be involved in the response to the fungicide in P. ultimum. Three genes coding for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase were more than 18-fold up-regulated in response to mefenoxam compared to the control, but not in the other tested conditions. Ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated proteolysis is activated in response to stress - such as nutrient limitation, heat shock, and exposure to heavy metals - that may cause formation of damaged, denatured, or misfolded proteins [93,94]. Thus, increased expression of these enzymes in P. ultimum exposed to mefenoxam might be related to decreased synthesis of rRNA and expression of aberrant proteins.P. ultimum does not typically exhibit release of zoospores from sporangia in culture [12] but zoospore release directly from aged oospores has been reported [95]. Comparative genomics with well studied whiplash flagellar proteins from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and other model organisms indicates that indeed P. ultimum does have the necessary genetic complement for flagella. Orthologs of tinsel flagellar mastigoneme proteins have also been identified in P. ultimum through comparison to those studied in Ochromonas danica, a unicellular member of the Straminipila kingdom. Overall, approximately 100 putative whiplash and tinsel flagellum gene orthologs were identified in P. ultimum (Table S7 in Additional file 2) with corresponding orthologs present in Ph. infestans, Ph. sojae, and Ph. ramorum. Expression of flagellar orthologs was observed in 8 growth conditions used in whole transcriptome sequencing, although 14 putative flagellar orthologs for axonemal dynein and kinesin and intraflagellar transport did not show expression in any condition.Perhaps the most remarkable discovery relative to gene family expansion is that there are four P. ultimum genes that encode cadherins. Previously, members of this gene family have only been found in metazoan genomes (and the one fully sequenced genome from the clade of nearest relatives, the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis). Cadherins are cell adhesion proteins that presumably evolved at the base of the clade containing metazoans and choanoflagellates [96]. Cadherin-related proteins are encoded in several bacterial genomes, but these bacterial proteins lack important calcium ion-binding motifs (the LDRE and DxND motifs) found in the extracellular (EC) repeat domains of 'true' cadherins [97]. The cadherin genes in P. ultimum do contain these motifs, and this is therefore the first report of true cadherins in a genome outside the metazoans/choanoflagellates. In metazoans, but not in choanoflagellates, some cadherins also contain an intracellular catenin-binding domain (CBD) that connects intercellular binding via EC domains to intracellular responses such as cytoskeletal changes. A search of predicted gene models with the PANTHER HMMs for cadherins (PTHR10596) identified two genes containing cadherin EC domains in the Ph. infestans genome, but none in the Ph. ramorum, Ph. sojae and Phaeodactylum tricornutum genomes. The identification of cadherin EC domains in both P. ultimum and Ph. infestans led us to postulate that such genes may also exist in other Phytophthora genomes that were not found in the original analysis of these genomes. Indeed, a TBLASTN search of genomic DNA using the predicted P. ultimum cadherin domain-containing proteins identified one putative cadherin-containing ORF in the Ph. sojae genome and four in the Ph. ramorum genome. The P. ultimum cadherin genes contain between 2 and 17 full-length cadherin EC domains, as predicted by the Pfam database [98] at the recommended statistical significance threshold, and likely a number of additional cadherin domains that have been truncated and/or have diverged past this similarity threshold. The genes from the Phytophthora genomes each contain between one and seven intact cadherin EC domains, though we did not attempt to construct accurate gene models for the Phytophthora genes. None of the oomycete cadherins appear to have the catenin-binding domain, nor do these genomes appear to encode a β-catenin gene, so like in M. brevicollis, the β-catenin-initiated part of the classical metazoan cadherin pathway appears to be absent from oomycetes.In order to explore the evolution of these domains in the oomycetes, we performed a phylogenetic analysis. The first (amino-terminal) cadherin EC domain has been used to explore gene phylogeny among the cadherins [96,99], and to facilitate comparison we used both neighbor joining [100] and maximum likelihood (using the PhyML program [101,102]) to estimate a phylogenetic tree for these same sequences together with all of the intact cadherin domains from the P. ultimum and Ph. infestans genomes (Figure ​(Figure2).2). To generate a high-quality protein sequence alignment for phylogeny estimation, we used the manual alignment of Nollet et al. [99] as a 'seed' for alignment of other sequences using MAFFT [102]. We found that all of the oomycete domains fall within a single clade. However, this clade is broad and also contains several cadherins from the choanoflagellate M. brevicollis, as well as some of the more divergent metazoan cadherins (Cr-2 and Cr-3 subfamilies). In general, the branches in this clade are very long, making phylogenetic reconstruction somewhat unreliable (all branches with bootstrap values > 50% are marked with a circle in Figure ​Figure2).2). Nevertheless, most of the cadherin domains found in P. ultimum are reliably orthologous to domains in one or more Phytophthora species, suggesting descent from a common ancestor by speciation. The most notable example is for the genes PITG_09983 and PYU1_T011030, in which a region spanning three consecutive EC repeats appears to have been inherited by both species from that common ancestor (apparently followed by substantial duplication and rearrangement of individual cadherin domains). These repeats are also apparently orthologous to repeats in both Ph. sojae and Ph. ramorum. The oomycete cadherins may have been initially obtained either vertically (by descent from the common ancestor with metazoans) or horizontally (by transfer of metazoan DNA long after divergence). No cadherins have been found in genomes sequenced from other clades more closely related to either oomycetes (for example, diatoms and alveolates) or the metazoan/choanoflagellates (for example, Fungi and amoebozoa). This means that, if cadherins were present in the most recent common ancestor of oomycetes and metazoans, these genes must have been lost independently in all of these other diverging lineages. Given the data currently available, it is more probable that at least one horizontal cadherin gene transfer event occurred from a choanoflagellate or metazoan to an oomycete ancestor, prior to the divergence of Pythium from Phytophthora. The source of the metazoan DNA may have been a host of the ancestral oomycete, or possibly introduced by a virus. Nevertheless, the subsequent preservation of cadherin domains in at least two lineages of oomycetes over a substantial period of time suggests that the genes are likely to perform an important function, which remains to be explored.Phylogenetic tree of the cadherin family, showing all members of the novel oomycete subfamily (green) and their relationships to representative metazoan and choanoflagellate cadherins. The major clades of cadherins [96] are colored: C-1 (blue), Cr-1a and Cr-1b (red), C-2 (purple), and Cr-3 (orange). Most of the oomycete cadherins fall within a fairly distinct subfamily (green), though this subfamily has many long branches and also includes some cadherins from the choanoflagellate M. brevicollis (labeled starting with 'MB') that are also highly diverged from other cadherins. Reliable branches (bootstrap > 50%) are labeled with a circle. All full-length oomycete cadherin domains are shown, from P. ultimum (labeled starting with 'Pu' and ending with the number of the repeat relative to the amino terminus), Ph. infestans (labeled starting with 'Pi'), Ph. sojae (Ps) and Ph. ramorum (Pr). Other cadherins are from the human genome ('Hs') unless labeled starting with 'Dm' (Drosophila melanogaster) or 'Ce' (Caenorhabditis elegans). The figure was drawn using the iTOL tool [143].A phylogenetic approach (PHRINGE [103]) was used to identify P. ultimum proteins orthologous to proteins encoded in the genomes of Ph. infestans, Ph. sojae, and Ph. ramorum. Of the 15,322 proteins predicted from the P. ultimum genome sequence, 12,230 were identified as orthologous to a protein in at least one Phytophthora genome sequence. A total of 11,331 proteins were identified as orthologs common to all three Phytophthora spp., and of these, 8,504 had identifiable orthologs in P. ultimum. PHRINGE was also used to examine the conservation of gene order (synteny) between the Phytophthora and P. ultimum genomes. As previously described [27], the gene order of orthologs is very highly conserved among Phytophthora spp. In P. ultimum the ortholog content was very similar between broad regions of the P. ultimum and Phytophthora genomes, but the local gene order was greatly rearranged, primarily as a result of inversions. Only short runs of up to 10 orthologs were found to be collinear, whereas runs of more than 100 could be identified between the Phytophthora spp. Figure ​Figure33 shows an example spanning a well-assembled region of the Ph. infestans, Ph. ramorum and P. ultimum genome sequences. In Ph. ramorum, the region spans 1.18 Mb and 383 predicted genes and in P. ultimum the region spans 1.15 Mb and 435 predicted genes. Of these genes, 286 are identified as orthologs. In the Ph. ramorum sequence there are an additional 38 genes with orthologs in Ph. infestans but not in P. ultimum. Due to a much larger number of repeat sequences, and expanded gene numbers, the corresponding region in Ph. infestans spans 2.38 Mb and 499 predicted genes, but the order of the orthologous genes is highly conserved with that of Ph. ramorum. The Ph. sojae genome shows similar conservation of gene order in this region but for simplicity is not shown.Rearrangements in gene order in the P. ultimum genome relative to Phytophthora genomes. Vertical brown bars indicate orthologs shared among P. ultimum, Ph. infestans and Ph. ramorum. Gold bars indicate orthologs shared only between Ph. infestans and Ph. ramorum. Turquoise bars indicate genes with orthologs in other regions of the compared genomes (that is, non-syntenic orthologs). Grey bars indicate genes without orthologs. Gray and red shaded connections indicate blocks of syntenic orthologs with the same or opposite relative transcriptional orientations, respectively. Non-coding regions of the genome are not depicted.Analysis of the P. ultimum genome sequence suggests that not all oomycete plant pathogens contain a similar 'toolkit' for survival and pathogenesis. Indeed, P. ultimum has a distinct effector repertoire compared to Phytophthora spp., including a lack of the hallmark RXLR effectors, a limited number of Crinkler genes, and a novel YxSL[RK] family of candidate effectors. The absence of any convincing RXLR effectors from the predicted proteome of P. ultimum, first noted by Cheung et al. [31] and rigorously confirmed here, provides a striking contrast to the Phytophthora genomes. RXLR effectors are also absent from the proteome of A. euteiches, a member of the Saprolegniales, which was predicted from an EST collection [64]. It is possible that RXLR effectors are confined to oomycete pathogens in the family Peronosporaceae, and represent an adaptation to facilitate biotrophy. The absence of RXLR effectors from P. ultimum (and possibly all other species of the genus) may be functionally associated with the very broad host range of Pythium pathogens. It also correlates with the lack of gene-for-gene resistance against Pythium and the fact that Pythium pathogens are generally restricted to necrotrophic infection of seedlings, stressed plants, and plant parts (for example, fruit) with diminished defenses against infection. In contrast to the RXLR effectors, the genome of P. ultimum does encode members of the Crinkler class of effectors, albeit not at the numbers present in Phytophthora genomes. These effectors may also enter host cells, and can trigger cell death [28]. They are also found in A. euteiches [64] and may represent a basal family of effectors that contribute to necrotrophy. This study uncovered a third family of secreted proteins conserved across all oomycetes sequenced so far with characteristics that suggest they might act inside host cells. These characteristics include high sequence variability, small size, hydrophilic nature, and a conserved RXLR-like motif (YxSL[KR]) with several family members specifically and highly expressed during infection. However, as yet no experimental data support this hypothesis.The repertoire of metabolic genes within the P. ultimum genome reflects its pathogenic lifestyle (Figure ​(Figure4).4). P. ultimum is an opportunistic pathogen of young seedlings and plant roots with little or no cuticle or heavily suberized tissue, consistent with lack of cutinase encoding genes. It is a poor competitor against secondary invaders of damaged plant tissues and soil organisms with better saprobic ability [13]. The P. ultimum genome contains a suite of GHs that fits well with an organism in this ecological niche. The genome encodes cellulases and pectinases that facilitate initial penetration and infection of the host, but it does not appear to use these plant polysaccharides as a major carbon source in culture and it lacks the ability to effectively degrade other complex polysaccharides such as xylan [70] (Table ​(Table3)3) and chitin [74,104]. As a primary pathogen that usually initiates infection, P. ultimum probably has first-hand access to easily degradable carbohydrates such as starch and sucrose. Following depletion of these carbon sources, it appears to focus on quick reproduction and production of survival structures [13] rather than switching its metabolism to the more difficult carbon sources such as plant cell wall polysaccharides. Intriguingly, the arsenal of P. ultimum enzymes targeting plant carbohydrates is strikingly similar to that found in the genome of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita [105], a root pathogen that also lacks xylanases yet has a strong pectin degrading capacity. In summary, access to the P. ultimum genome sequence has reinforced earlier hypotheses on pathogenesis and survival mechanisms in oomycete plant pathogens and has advanced our understanding of events at the plant-pathogen interface, especially during necrotrophy.The P. ultimum genome contains genes encoding enzyme activities necessary for the degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides and storage sugars (blue ticks indicate the polysaccharides targeted by P. ultimum enzymes). Some activities are equally relevant for P. ultimum's own cell wall metabolism. Degradation of the plant cell wall relies essentially on the action of cellulases and pectinases. Significantly, the absence of identified enzymes with xylanase, pectin methylesterase or cutinase activities is in agreement with previous studies of P. ultimum and other Pythium spp. [70,104,144]. For Pythium's pathogenic action, penetration is primarily limited to wounded tissue, or to young roots and germinating seedlings with little or no suberized tissue. Penetration and root rot, for some Pythium spp., is limited to the first layers of cells (RC and EC) [104]. Other genes, including those coding for transporters, elicitin-like, and stress proteins, were upregulated when P. ultimum was grown in contact with A. thaliana seeds. CC, cortical cells; EC, epidermal cells; RC, root cap; H, hyphae. (Figure adapted from [104,144-146].)P. ultimum (DAOM BR144 = CBS 805.95 = ATCC 200006) was sequenced using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach. Sequencing of three Sanger libraries generated 263,715 quality filtered reads (281,088 attempted reads). Three full runs of 454 FLX standard pyrosequencing [106] generated 1,296,941 reads. These were assembled by a 'shredding' pipeline [107] that generates pseudo-Sanger reads from the contigs of a Newbler assembly [106] of 454 reads and then assembles all of the reads with Celera Assembler [108]. This yielded 2,659 contigs in 714 scaffolds with an N50 contig size of 40,520 bp. The 1,945 intra-scaffold gaps were subjected to AutoClosure, an in-house pipeline that automates primer design, template re-array, and reaction orders. This produced 6,468 reads, of which 5,014 passed quality filtering. Subsequently, the Celera Assembler software was modified to accept 454 reads without shredding [109] and Celera Assembler 5.2 was run on the Sanger shotgun, 454 shotgun, and Sanger AutoClosure reads together. Contigs for the mitochondrial genome were identified and annotated separately with 16,277 sequences assembled for a greater than 200-fold coverage. The whole genome shotgun project has been deposited at NCBI [GenBank:{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ADOS00000000"",""term_id"":""298575364"",""term_text"":""ADOS00000000""}}ADOS00000000] along with the 454 reads [SRA:SRX020087], the mitochondrial genome [GenBank:{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GU138662"",""term_id"":""269810812"",""term_text"":""GU138662""}}GU138662], and the Sanger reads (NCBI Trace Archive under species code 'PYTHIUM ULTIMUM DAOM BR144'). The version described in this paper is the first version [WGS:{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ADOS01000000"",""term_id"":""298575364"",""term_text"":""gb||ADOS01000000""}}ADOS01000000].The P. ultimum genome annotations were created using the MAKER program [110]. The program was configured to use both spliced EST alignments as well as single exon ESTs greater than 250 bp in length as evidence for producing hint-based gene predictions. MAKER was also set to filter out gene models for short and partial gene predictions that produce proteins with fewer than 28 amino acids. The MAKER pipeline was set to produce ab initio gene predictions from both the repeat-masked and unmasked genomic sequence using SNAP [111], FGENESH [112], and GeneMark [113]. Hint-based gene predictions were derived from SNAP and FGENESH.The EST sequences used in the annotation process were derived from Sanger and 454 sequenced P. ultimum DAOM BR144 ESTs [31] considered together with ESTs from dbEST [114] for Aphanomyces cochlioides, Phytophthora brassicae, Phytophthora capsici, Phytophthora parasitica, Ph. sojae, Ph. infestans, and Pythium oligandrum. Protein evidence was derived from the UniProt/Swiss-Prot protein database [115,116] and from predicted proteins for Ph. infestans [28], Ph. ramorum [27], and Ph. sojae [27]. Repetitive elements were identified within the MAKER pipeline using the Repbase repeat library [117] and RepeatMasker [45] in conjunction with a MAKER internal transposable element database [118] and a P. ultimum specific repeat library prepared for this work (created using PILER [119] with settings suggested in the PILER documentation). Ab initio gene predictions and hint-based gene predictions [110] were produced within the MAKER pipeline using FGENESH trained for Ph. infestans, GeneMark trained for P. ultimum via internal self-training, and SNAP trained for P. ultimum from a conserved gene set identified by CEGMA [110].Following the initial MAKER run, a total of 14,967 genes encoding 14,999 transcripts were identified, each of which were supported by homology to a known protein or had at least one splice site confirmed by EST evidence. Additional ab initio gene predictions not overlapping a MAKER annotation were scanned for protein domains using InterProScan [120-122]. This process identified an additional 323 gene predictions; these were added to the annotation set, producing a total of 15,290 genes encoding 15,322 transcripts (referred to as v3). Selected genes within the MAKER produced gene annotation set were manually annotated using the annotation-editing tool Apollo [123]. The final annotation set (v4) contained 15,297 genes encoding 15,329 transcripts, including six rRNA transcripts.Putative functions were assigned to each predicted P. ultimum protein using BLASTP [124] to identify the best homologs from the UniProt/Swiss-Prot protein database and/or through manual curation. Additional functional annotations include molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) calculated using the pepstats program from the EMBOSS package [125], subcellular localization predicted with TargetP using the non-plant network [126], prediction of transmembrance helices via TMHMM [127], and PFAM (v23.0) families using HMMER [128] in which only hits above the trusted cutoff were retained. Expert annotation of carbohydrate-related enzymes was performed using the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme database (CAZy) annotation pipeline [68].Eight cDNA libraries were constructed to assess the expression profile of P. ultimum. Initially, plugs of 10% V8 agar containing P. ultimum strain DAOM BR144 were incubated for 1 day in yeast extract broth (YEB; 30 g/l sucrose, 1 g/l KH2PO4, 0.5 g/l MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g/l KCl, 10 mg/l FeSO4·7H2O, 1 g/l yeast extract) at 25°C with shaking (200 rpm). Approximately 50 mg of hyphae growing out of the plugs were then transferred to flasks containing media for the various expression assays. Mycelium was grown under the following conditions: 1, nutrient-rich YEB medium for 3 days at 25°C with shaking (200 rpm) and nutrient-starved Plich medium (S Kamoun, unpublished) for 10 days at 25°C in standing culture, as previously described [31]; 2, YEB medium under hypoxic conditions (oxygen concentration of 0.2%) for 1 and 3 days in standing liquid culture at 25°C; 3, YEB medium for 2 days at 25°C with shaking (200 rpm) followed by the addition of 1 and 100 μl/l of the fungicide mefenoxam (Subdue MAXX™, Novartis Crop Production, Greensboro, NC, USA) and subsequent incubation for an additional 0.25, 3 and 6 hours at the same temperature and with agitation; 4, YEB medium for the same time periods but without the addition of mefenoxam was included (mefenoxam control); 5, YEB medium for 2 days at 25°C with shaking (200 rpm) followed by a cold stress of 0°C with shaking (200 rpm) for 0.25, 3 and 6 hours; or 6, YEB medium for 2 days at 25°C with shaking (200 rpm) followed by exposure to heat stress of 35°C for 0.25, 3 and 6 hours; 7, YEB medium for 2 days at 25°C followed by exposure to 25°C for 0.25, 3 and 6 hours (temperature control); 8, 0.1% V8-juice medium containing surface-sterilized A. thaliana ecotype Columbia Col-0 seeds. Approximately 200 seeds were placed in the liquid medium at 25°C with shaking (200 rpm) for 1, 2 and 7 days. Mycelium of P. ultimum was then added and allowed to grow in contact with the seeds for 3 days.For each condition listed above, mycelium was harvested, macerated in liquid nitrogen and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described [31]. RNA was treated with DNAse (Promega RQ1 RNase-Free DNase, Madison, WI, USA) and 10 μg RNA was used to construct cDNA using the mRNA-Seq Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), which was sequenced with Illumina Genome Analyzer (GA) II using version 3 sequencing reagents for 41 cycles. Base calling was carried out using the Illumina GA pipeline v1.4.For each library, the filtered reads from the Illumina GA II pipeline were mapped using Tophat, a splice-site-aware short read mapper that works in conjunction with Bowtie short read aligner [129]. Reads were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive [SRA:SRP002690]. The minimum and maximum intron sizes were 5 bp and 15 kbp, respectively, for each Tophat run. The final annotation GFF3 file was provided to Tophat and expression values were calculated using reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (RPKM) [130]. The minimum RPKM for all eight conditions was 0, the median RPKM ranged from 5 to 8, while the maximum RPKM ranged from 10,182 in the YEP+Plich library to 32,041 from the 35°C temperature treatment. Using a RPKM value of 2.5 (approximately half of the median RPKM of all genes in each library) as a cutoff for expression, loci with differential expression in treatment versus control were identified (comparisons: hypoxia versus YEB+Plich; Arabidopsis versus YEB+Plich; mefenoxam treatment versus mefenoxam control; heat treatment versus temperature control; cold treatment versus temperature control; Table S6 in Additional file 2). The fold changes were calculated for loci with RPKM ≥ 2.5 in both treatment and control samples. Loci with control values < 2.5 RPKM but with expression in treatment conditions were flagged as 'U' as a true ratio could not be calculated. Loci with treatment values < 2.5 RPKM but with expression in control conditions were flagged as 'D' as a true ratio could not be calculated. Loci with RPKM < 2.5 in both treatment and control samples were flagged as 'N'.The secretome of P. ultimum was identified using SignalP V2.0 program following the PexFinder algorithm as described previously [56]. In addition, sequences that were predicted to contain transmembrane domains or organelle targeting signals were omitted from the secretome. Each sequence in the secretome was searched against two 'Darwin' databases [57] that were compiled from > 50 eukaryote whole proteomes from major phylogenetic branches using BLASTP with an E-value cutoff of 1 × 10-3. One database contained sequences only from Fungi and the other contained the sequences from other organisms excluding the Fungi and oomycetes. Protein sequences of the secretome were clustered into families along with their related non-secretory proteins by using the TRIBE-MCL algorithm [131] using BLASTP with an E-value cutoff of 1 × 10-10. Each family was named according to the existing annotation of the member sequences. Families and singletons were searched against Pfam-A release 24.0 using the HMMER3 beta 3 hmmsearch with trusted cutoffs to detect any transposable-element-related proteins that may have been missed in the repeat masking process. Families or singletons where at least 50% of the members matched transposon-associated Pfam domains were manually curated to identify and exclude true transposon-related sequences from the secretome.For the analysis of genome organization, P. ultimum predicted genes were binned according to the length of their flanking non-coding regions (FIRs). FIRs were computed using predicted gene coordinates on scaffolds. Binning according to 5' FIRs and 3' FIRs was performed along the x-aixs and y-axis, respectively, using conditional counting functions. Logarithmic size was chosen for the bins in order to allow a maximum dispersion of the values. A color code was used to represent the number of genes or average values in bins. Average values were computed for bins containing a minimum of three genes.Motif searches were done using the MEME [132] prediction server with default parameters except the following: min width = 4; max width = 12; min sites = 10. Sequences with homology to gene models in oomycetes genomes were identified by BLAST analysis against the NR database and aligned using MUSCLE [133]. For phylogenetic inference of the CRN genes, alignments were done using RevTrans [134] with the dialign-T algorithm. Molecular phylogenetic reconstructions were done using RAxML [135] version 7.0. Sequence logos were constructed on the basis of the RevTrans alignment using WebLogo [136].In order to find substantial expansions and contractions of gene families observed in other eukaryotes, we used the PANTHER Classification System [49,137,138]. We first scored all predicted proteins from the P. ultimum genome against the PANTHER HMMs, and created a tab-delimited file with two columns: the P. ultimum protein identifier and the PANTHER HMM identifier from the top-scoring HMM (if E-value < 0.001). We created similar files for three Phytophthora genomes (Ph. infestans, Ph. ramorum, and Ph. sojae), and a diatom genome (P. tricornutum) for comparison. We removed protein families of probable viral origin or transposons (PTHR19446, PTHR10178, PTHR11439, PTHR23022, PTHR19303). This left 7,762 P. ultimum proteins in PANTHER families, 8,169 from Ph. infestans, 7,667 from Ph. ramorum and 7,701 from Ph. sojae. We then uploaded the tab-delimited files to the PANTHER Gene List Comparison Tool [137,139] and analyzed the list for under- and over-representation of genes with respect to molecular functions, biological processes, and pathways. For each class that was significantly different (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05) between P. ultimum and all of the Phytophthora genomes, we determined the protein family expansions or contractions that made the biggest contributions to these differences (Table ​(Table1).1). Finally, we determined likely gene duplication and loss events that generated the observed protein family expansions and contractions by building phylogenetic trees of each of these families using the 48 genomes included in the trees on the PANTHER website [140], in addition to the five stramenopile genomes above (P. ultimum, Ph. infestans, Ph. ramorum, Ph. sojae, P. tricornutum). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the GIGA algorithm [141], which infers the timing of likely gene duplication events relative to speciation events, allowing the reconstruction of ancestral genome content and lineage-specific duplications and losses. Using v3 of the annotation (MAKER output without manual curation), P. ultimum genes orthologous to genes in Ph. infestans, Ph. sojae and Ph. ramorum were identified using PHRINGE ('Phylogenetic Resources for the Interpretation of Genomes') [103] in which the evolutionary relationships among all oomycete protein families are reconstructed.Growth was compared on different media. Carbon sources were added to Minimal Media (MM; per liter: 0.5 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g K2HPO4, 4 × 10-4 g MnSO4, 4 × 10-4 g ZnSO4, 1.05 g NH4Cl, 6.8 ml 1M CaCl2·2H2O, 2 ml 1M MgSO4·7H2O, 4 × 10-3 g FeSO4 and 1% (w/v) agarose) at the following concentrations: 1% (w/v) for cellulose, soluble starch, citrus pectin and birchwood xylan and 25 mM for D-glucose, D-fructose, D-xylose, cellobiose, sucrose and L-arabinose. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.0 and the medium was autoclaved at 121°C for 20 minutes. CaCl2, MgSO4, and monosaccharides were autoclaved separately from the rest of the medium and FeSO4 was sterile filtered (Whatman 0.2 μm millipore filter, Dassel, Germany). All of these components were added to the autoclaved medium before it solidified. The growth of P. ultimum DAOM BR144 was compared on the different media mentioned above; Minimal Media without a carbon source was used as the negative control in this experiment. The strain was initially grown on Potato Carrot Agar [142]. A small agar plug containing mycelium (1 mm diameter) was transferred from the edge of a vigorously growing 1-day-old colony to the center of the Petri dishes with the different media. The cultures were incubated in the dark at 21°C. Mycelium density and colony diameter were measured daily for the first 5 days and again after 7 days. Colony morphology pictures were taken, and pH was measured after 7 days. The growth test was conducted twice for each strain.bp: base pairs; CBEL: cellulose-binding elicitor lectin; CRN"" Crinkler; EC: extracellular; EST: expressed sequence tag; FIR: flanking non-coding region; GH: glycoside hydrolase; HMM: Hidden Markov Model; MAMP: microbial-associated molecular pattern; ORF: open reading frame; PAMP: pathogen-associated molecular pattern; RPKM: reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads; YEB: yeast extract broth.CAL, NT, and CRB directed the project, performed analyses, and drafted the manuscript.

PMC2930009,"Abundance and Diversity of Dockerin-Containing Proteins in the Fiber-Degrading Rumen Bacterium, Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1",False,"The cellulosome is a multi-enzyme machine, which plays a key role in the breakdown of plant cell walls in many anaerobic cellulose-degrading microorganisms. Ruminococcus flavefaciens FD-1, a major fiber-degrading bacterium present in the gut of herbivores, has the most intricate cellulosomal organization thus far described. Cellulosome complexes are assembled through high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interactions. More than two-hundred dockerin-containing proteins have been identified in the R. flavefaciens genome, yet the reason for the expansion of these crucial cellulosomal components is yet unknown.We have explored the full spectrum of 222 dockerin-containing proteins potentially involved in the assembly of cellulosome-like complexes of R. flavefaciens. Bioinformatic analysis of the various dockerin modules showed distinctive conservation patterns within their two Ca2+-binding repeats and their flanking regions. Thus, we established the conceptual framework for six major groups of dockerin types, according to their unique sequence features. Within this framework, the modular architecture of the parent proteins, some of which are multi-functional proteins, was evaluated together with their gene expression levels. Specific dockerin types were found to be associated with selected groups of functional components, such as carbohydrate-binding modules, numerous peptidases, and/or carbohydrate-active enzymes. In addition, members of other dockerin groups were linked to structural proteins, e.g., cohesin-containing proteins, belonging to the scaffoldins.This report profiles the abundance and sequence diversity of the R. flavefaciens FD-1 dockerins, and provides the molecular basis for future understanding of the potential for a wide array of cohesin-dockerin specificities. Conserved differences between dockerins may be reflected in their stability, function or expression within the context of the parent protein, in response to their role in the rumen environment.Cellulolytic ruminococci play a major role in the breakdown of plant cell wall material in the rumen and in the hindgut of mammals [1]–[5]. Although their cellulolytic enzyme systems have been investigated for many years [6]–[16] the mechanisms by which they achieve plant cell wall breakdown are only now becoming clear. Recent work on two Ruminococcus flavefaciens strains, 17 and FD-1 has revealed a cellulosomal type of enzyme complex, in which a number of the known hydrolytic enzymes have been shown to associate with scaffolding proteins ScaA and ScaB, via specific cohesin-dockerin interactions [17]–[20]. The system in R. flavefaciens, however, appears more complex than those reported previously in cellulolytic Clostridium species [21]–[23] and comprises numerous cohesin-containing scaffoldins (ScaA, ScaB, ScaC and ScaE) together with interacting enzymes and dockerin-containing proteins [24]. The major structural components of the R. flavefaciens cellulosome are encoded by the sca gene cluster, whose presence has been demonstrated in five different strains of this species [25].Notably, not all types of dockerins found in enzymes from R. flavefaciens interact with ScaA or ScaB, and there are indications that additional cohesin-dockerin specificities and additional scaffolding proteins are involved in assembling these enzymes into complexes [19]. In this context, ScaA was shown to interact with the small adaptor protein, ScaC, which carries a divergent cohesin that recognises a range of thus far unidentified proteins, distinct from those recognised by the ScaA cohesins [26].The anchoring of the cellulosome complex to the bacterial cell envelope has also been found to differ from the clostridial cellulosome model. A novel single-cohesin scaffolding protein, ScaE, has a C-terminal anchoring domain with a canonical LPXTG motif that is bound covalently to the bacterial peptidoglycan via a sortase-mediated mechanism [27]. The C-terminal dockerin of ScaB interacts specifically with the cohesin of the bacterial cell-wall anchored ScaE, thereby associating the entire complex to the cell surface. Another key feature of the R. flavefaciens system is that identifiable carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are absent from the known scaffolding proteins, but the sca gene cluster encodes a distinct cellulose binding protein, CttA, which is also bound to ScaE via a C-terminal dockerin [28].To date, the bulk of our understanding of the R. flavefaciens cellulosome system has come from analysis of the sca gene cluster. More extensive analysis of the R. flavefaciens FD-1 genome [24] indicated that it harbours the largest number of dockerin-containing components known so far, and explored the expression of cellulolytic enzymes via functional microarray analysis. In the present communication, we have analyzed the draft genome sequence of R. flavefaciens FD-1, in order to profile the full spectrum of cohesin-dockerin types and the full range of interacting dockerin-containing proteins involved in the assembly of cellulosome-like complexes. In this context, we report herein an analysis of an unprecedented number of dockerin sequences and their flanking regions that have been detected in the R. flavefaciens FD-1 draft genome. The sequences of dockerins were thus examined and classified into nine groups with distinct sequence features. In addition, the characteristics of the parent proteins were examined with respect to their modular architecture with a focus on carbohydrate-active modules and gene expression levels. Altogether, the results demonstrate the abundance and variability of the dockerins and suggest the potential for a wide array of cohesin-dockerin specificities.
R. flavefaciens FD-1 genomic DNA was sequenced at the ‘University of Illinois in-house genomic facility’ using a shotgun sequencing approach. Details of the genome assembly and statistics can be seen in Berg Miller et al
[24].Contigs from the R. flavefaciens FD-1 genome were used to create a local database of nucleotides and translated open reading frames were generated using the heuristic model of GeneMark™-Gene prediction software programs (http://exon.biology.gatech.edu/GeneMark/). A local BLAST search engine (http://www.ncbi.com) was used at the Rowett Research Institute computer facility (openMosix Beowulf cluster) to retrieved dockerin-containing signature sequences [29]. In each case, the search was initiated with a 60-amino-acid sequence of the R. flavefaciens strain 17 dockerin from Cel44A (formerly known as EndB, {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q934F9"",""term_id"":""75450425"",""term_text"":""Q934F9""}}Q934F9), ScaA ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q9AE53"",""term_id"":""123317832"",""term_text"":""Q9AE53""}}Q9AE53), ScaB ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q9AE52"",""term_id"":""75462332"",""term_text"":""Q9AE52""}}Q9AE52), Ce3B ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q9RLB8"",""term_id"":""75420533"",""term_text"":""Q9RLB8""}}Q9RLB8) and Xyn11E ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q9L3K3"",""term_id"":""75416283"",""term_text"":""Q9L3K3""}}Q9L3K3).Sequences were then further analyzed individually to identify obvious modular structures and BLAST searches were carried out on individual modules or entire polypeptides accordingly. Annotation was carried out using the aid of CD-search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi), Pfam domain database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/), Carbonydrate active enzyme-CAZY (http://www.cazy.org/) and Interpro database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/-interpro/). Low-scoring hits were inspected individually by comparing them against known dockerin sequences for alignment of conserved amino acids.Dockerins were first compared with each other using BLAST searches, and sequences with significant similarity (E values below 10−8) were grouped together. Sequences in each group were aligned (using ClustalW [30] and Dialign [31]) for careful inspection of their features. The similarity of the sequences was manually examined along different segments of the dockerin, including the two Ca2+-binding repeats, putative helices and linkers. Logos of the sequences in each group were created with Weblogo v.2.8.2 (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/). Searches for homologs were done using BLAST against the non-redundant databases.The change in gene expression of R. flavefaciens FD-1 was determined by Berg Miller et al
[24] for cultures grown on either cellulose [0.1% w/v pebble milled cellulose (filter paper)] or cellobiose (0.4% w/v) as a carbon and energy substrate. Microarray data was obtained from Table S9 in Berg Miller et al
[24].In order to identify dockerin-containing proteins in the R. flavefaciens FD-1 draft genome, we applied BLAST searches using homologous dockerins, and revealed 205 putative ORFs with complete dockerin modules, and 17 additional partial domains. The protein sequences of the dockerins are very diverse, and the sequence similarity between them ranges from 20 to 98%. However, most dockerin modules include all the characteristic segments as described earlier [32], including two Ca2+-binding repeats (segments b1 and b2) and their flanking regions (putative helices c1 and c2, and segments d and e) (Fig. 1). Notably, almost all dockerins begin with the canonically conserved Gly residue, with the exception of three dockerins ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ORF00614"",""term_id"":""1178789613"",""term_text"":""ORF00614""}}ORF00614, {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ORF01191"",""term_id"":""1178790199"",""term_text"":""ORF01191""}}ORF01191 and {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ORF02267"",""term_id"":""1178791296"",""term_text"":""ORF02267""}}ORF02267), which start with either Pro, Arg or Ser, respectively.The 222 dockerins were clustered into groups according to their conserved sequence features, and their sequence logo is presented. Segments along the dockerin modules (b–e at top) are labelled according to Pagés et al [32]. The length of the second repeat is marked for each group.Examination of the sequence conservation along the dockerin modules allowed further classification of the dockerins into five major groups and four sub-groups (Fig. 1, and Table S1). Dockerins in each group share common patterns of residues with significant sequence similarity, together with unique and conserved sequence features which were manually refined. These include common residues of the Ca2+-binding repeats or in their flanking regions, which distinguish between the groups.The largest number of dockerins (96) are clustered into group 1 (Fig. 1), which is further divided into four subgroups (a–d), based on conserved sequence features which distinguish the dockerins in each group. Group 1 dockerins include the characteristic sequences VxIMQxxxNP in segments c1, and ALxIQKxxL in segments c2. They have exceptional features compared to all other dockerins: they contain the longest region linking between the Ca2+-binding repeats, (segment d, 37–45 aa long), where the sequences in group 1b are the longest because of an insertion sequence within it. Group 1 dockerins have an atypical number of conserved residues in the second Ca2+-binding repeat (segment b2), which is usually 12 residues long. However, in group 1a, 1b and 1c in this Ca2+-binding repeat is 13 residues long and in group 1d it is 11 residues long. A BLAST search with all group 1 dockerins against all known dockerins shows that they are exclusive to R. flavefaciens, because their only homologs are dockerins from R. flavefaciens strain 17. Representatives of this group of dockerins from both FD-1 and R17 strains were previously shown to bind to the cohesins present in ScaA, and to additional ScaA-type cohesins that are also present in ScaB in R. flavefaciens FD-1
[18], [20]. Of special interest is the cohesin-carrying protein ScaC ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ORF03113"",""term_id"":""1178792165"",""term_text"":""ORF03113""}}ORF03113) [20], [26], which is mostly similar to group 1b dockerins, although it contains two insertions that are absent from the other group members.
Group 2 dockerins include a small number of sequences, which are not similar to any other known dockerin from the non-redundant database. Only the first Ca2+-binding repeat was identified in these dockerins, and the dockerin itself was located at the C-terminus of each protein. Therefore, they may be either partial, and thus non-functional, or they can represent a new type of a single-binding mode of attachment to cohesins.Unlike the group 2 sequences, group 3 contains full-length dockerin modules, some of which are “clostridial” in nature, i.e., homologous to dockerins of Clostridium cellulovorans, C. papyrosolvens and C. cellulolyticum (gi numbers: {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ZP_04807887.1"",""term_id"":""242263276"",""term_text"":""ZP_04807887.1""}}ZP_04807887.1, {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ZP_05497793.1"",""term_id"":""256757054"",""term_text"":""ZP_05497793.1""}}ZP_05497793.1 and {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""YP_002505573.1"",""term_id"":""220928664"",""term_text"":""YP_002505573.1""}}YP_002505573.1, respectively). Group 3 dockerins exhibit unusually high sequence variation in segments c1 and d. Interestingly, one of its dockerins is a CE3B homologue, known to bind the cohesin of the ScaC adaptor protein [20]. In future work, it will be interesting to determine whether other group 3 dockerins also exhibit specificity of binding to the ScaC cohesin.
Group 4 dockerins are exclusive in R. flavefaciens FD-1, and do not have any known homologs in other bacteria. Comparison of the two repeating segments of the dockerins shows that group 4a and 4b dockerins are the only groups with internal sequence symmetry (Fig. 2). Dockerins of group 4a are similar to those from ScaB and CttA [28]. Newly recognised ScaB and CttA dockerins from R. flavefaciens 17 have been shown to bind to the cohesin of the cell-wall attached ScaE protein [20], [27], [28]. Group 4a dockerins are diverged from group 4b, which contain a shorter d segment, and also have a distinct conserved pattern in segments c1 and c2 (Fig. 1).The two putative calcium-binding repeats within each sequence were aligned for two representative dockerin sequences. Identical residues are shown in bold font.The six group 4b dockerins exhibit an interesting genomic organization. Five similar dockerins are arranged at the C-terminus of five ORFs ({""type"":""entrez-protein-range"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ORF01263-ORF01267"",""start_term"":""ORF01263"",""end_term"":""ORF01267"",""start_term_id"":""1178790272"",""end_term_id"":""1178790277""}}ORF01263-ORF01267), which are located head-to-tail in the same loci on the genome and may be regulated in a probable operon. These dockerin-containing proteins include a putative transglutaminase-like domain, and a signal peptide (Table 1). Interestingly, the C-terminal part of each protein is conserved among the five proteins (including regions upstream of the dockerin), while the N-terminal part is variable. Notably, their first Ca2+-binding repeat may be extended from 12 aa to 15 aa, due to the presence of a conserved Asp in position 16 of the dockerin. The additional group 4b dockerin ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ORF01696"",""term_id"":""1178790713"",""term_text"":""ORF01696""}}ORF01696) is similar to the other sequences, however, it is not in the same loci with them.The dockerin of the ScaA protein is classified in its own group (group 5) as a single member and has unique sequence features, which differ from those of all other groups. The classification of a single dockerin in a single group is warranted in this case, owing to the central role that the parent protein plays in cellulosome architecture and the inclusion of its gene in the major scaffoldin gene cluster. Comparison of the ScaA dockerin among other R. flavefaciens strains (Fig. 3) shows a conserved N-terminus and a few variable positions at its C-terminus.Protein sequences were adapted from Jindou et al [25]. The N-terminal parts of the sequences are more conserved than the C-terminal part, and the second calcium-binding repeat could not be recognised. Thus, the labels of the dockerin modules (b–e at top) are approximated.In the group 6a dockerins, conserved Phe (in segments b1 and b2) and Trp (in c1 and d) residues were detected. Not all of these residues are conserved in group 6b, which contains dockerins with the shortest d segment of all dockerins (32 residues). Dockerins from these groups are homologous to a few dockerins from Clostridium and Ruminococcus species.After categorization of the R. flavefaciens dockerins into the above groups and sub-groups, only eight additional dockerins remained, which could not be attributed to any of the groups, owing to the very low sequence similarity.Inspection of the microarray data [24]) revealed the overall status of gene expression levels in the different dockerin groups (Fig. 4). As reported earlier, the expression levels of the majority (60%) of the dockerin-containing genes remained unaffected. However, as shown in the figure, most of the groups exhibit both up- and down-regulated genes. In some cases (i.e., groups 1c, 4b, 6a, 6b and the miscellaneous group of dockerins), no down-regulated genes were observed. In others, a bias towards up- (groups 1b and 3) or down-regulated genes (groups 1d and 2) was apparent. Interestingly, the genes in group 1a are almost equally distributed among the three categories (up, down and unaffected).Number of up-regulated (green), down-regulated (red) or unaffected (blue) genes is marked for each group of dockerins. Expression data were determined for cultures grown on either cellulose [0.1% w/v pebble milled cellulose (filter paper)] or cellobiose (0.4% w/v) as a carbon and energy substrate, based on Berg Miller et al
[24], where fold changes greater than or equal to 2-fold were considered up-regulated and fold changes less than or equal to 0.5-fold were considered down-regulated.In several cases, genes of a single group appeared to be clustered into the same genomic locus (Table 1). This pattern was observed for certain genes in groups 1a, 1b, 4a, 4b, 6a and 6b, but not for those in groups 1c, 1d, 2 and 3. Some of these vicinal genes may be co-regulated, based on the microarray data [24], and these gene clusters may thus comprise operons.Most of the ORFs of proteins containing complete dockerin modules have an N-terminal signal peptide. Among the predicted complete gene products, dockerins were typically located at the C-terminus (in 156 proteins), while in 32 other proteins the dockerins were internal, and in 19 cases were located at the N-terminus (following the signal peptide).The occurrence of both catalytic and non-catalytic (structural) modules in dockerin-containing proteins was analyzed further, within the context of the different dockerin groups (Table 2 and Fig. 5). In total, ∼50% of the dockerins were detected together with carbohydrate-active enzymes, including glycoside hydrolase modules, polysaccharide lyases and carbohydrate esterases. The total number of modules in the different categories of Table 2 exceeds the number of sequences (222) owing to the multi-modular nature of the dockerin-containing proteins. Unlike the other known genomes from cellulosome-producing bacteria, a significant number of dockerins were associated with protein modules annotated as putative peptidases. Moreover, numerous CBMs and cohesin-containing structural proteins (scaffoldins) were distributed among the dockerin-bearing proteins. Most of these modules appeared in dockerin-containing proteins, whose dockerins belong to groups 1a, 1b, 3 and 6. Notably, a great number of domains/modules of unknown function were observed. However, the distribution of different modules varied among the dockerin groups, as described below.Dockerin groups are shown on the x axis (number of encoded proteins carrying each type of dockerin in parentheses). UNK, unknown function; LRR, leucine rich repeats; CBM, carbohydrate binding modules; PEP, peptidases; CE, carbohydrate esterases; PL, pectate lyases; GH, glycoside hydrolases The small number of dockerins of group 2 and 5 not shown (but see Table 2).In terms of the content of carbohydrate-active enzymes [33], groups 1a, 1b and 3 were significantly enriched in the numbers of glycoside hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases and associated CBMs. Notably, most if not all of the genuine dockerin-containing cellulases (i.e., confirmed endo- and exoglucanases) were members of group 1a and 1b, and most of these were associated with group 1a. Group 1a dockerin-containing enzymes included the sole critical GH48 exoglucanase, four GH9 endoglucanases and six GH5 cellulases (an additional GH5 enzyme is annotated as a xylanase). Group 1a also contained most of the family 10 and 11 xylanases, two GH26 mannanases and a GH44 enzyme (related to the well-documented EndB enzyme from R. flavefaciens strain 17 [17]). Group 1b contained the remainder of the cellulases; two from family 5 and three from family 9. The other enzymes that bear group 1b dockerins were annotated as hemicellulases, including the lone GH74 xyloglucanase. In contrast, all of the parent enzymes associated with the group 3 dockerins were putative hemicellulases. Similarly, most or all of the group 6a and 6b dockerin-containing enzymes were annotated as hemicellulases from various families.Most (14 out of 20) of the proteins carrying carbohydrate esterase (CE) modules were classified as multifunctional proteins (Table 3), which will be discussed in the subsequent section. Conversely, most (8 of 11) of the dockerin-bearing polysaccharide lyases (PLs) did not carry an additional catalytic module. In both cases, their distribution into the dockerin groups was rather similar to that of the GH-bearing enzymes. None of the dockerins in this category belonged to groups 1c, 1d, 2, 4a or 4b.One of the intriguing features apparent in the R. flavefaciens cellulosome is the relatively high number of putative proteases in dockerin-containing proteins, which contrasts sharply with the genome of C. thermocellum. Interestingly, about half of these appended dockerins belong to group 4. Significantly, 5 of the 6 dockerins from group 4b are attached to the proteins annotated as transglutaminase-like enzymes as described above.Even more intriguing is the number of dockerin-containing proteins that contain regions lacking similarity to known proteins and thus designated “unknown”. This includes 118 different proteins representing 155 putative domains of unknown function. Again, the presence of such a large number of unknown domains in putative cellulosomal proteins of R. flavefaciens is in stark contrast to the genome of C. thermocellum, in which only eight unknown dockerin-containing proteins are evident.Dockerin-containing proteins that contained more than one catalytic module (i.e., GH, PL and/or CE) were observed mainly in groups 1a, 1b and 3, and were particularly apparent among dockerin-carrying xylanases and other hemicellulases (Table 3). Most of these proteins were up-regulated in cells grown on microcrystalline cellulose (versus cellobiose), sometimes to excess, and none were down-regulated. These observations underscore the significance of this complex set of multi-functional enzymes and their importance in the degradation of recalcitrant cellulosic plant cell wall polysaccharides, in this fiber-degrading rumen bacterium.By definition, cellulosomal cohesin-containing proteins are classified as scaffoldins that play a structural role in cellulosome architecture. Not all of the putative cohesin-containing scaffoldins contain dockerins, and several suspected R. flavefaciens cohesin modules remain unconfirmed. Only two of these scaffoldins, ScaC and a ScaE-like protein, contain dockerins that are members of a group (1b), which would presumably bind large numbers of carbohydrate-active enzymes. The others are distributed in groups, in which such enzymes are either rare or lacking altogether. Four confirmed cohesin-carrying proteins that are encoded by the sca gene cluster were described in previous publications [22]
[25]. The general organization of the gene cluster in the different R. flavefaciens strains is identical, although the sequences and modular structure of the proteins differ. The scaffoldin proteins encoded by the sca gene cluster constitute the backbone of cellulosome architecture in this bacterium. Three of them, ScaA, ScaB and ScaC, carry C-terminal dockerins, while ScaE carries a cell surface attachment signal motif, but no dockerin. In contrast to ScaC, the dockerins of ScaA and ScaB belong to groups 5 and 4, respectively.Genomic analysis of R. flavefaciens FD-1 has revealed the most diversified and elaborate cellulosome complex thus far discovered. The cellulosome of this bacterial strain possesses an unprecedented number of dockerin-containing proteins (at least 222), when compared with other cellulolytic bacteria. The genome of C. thermocellum, for example, contains only about 76 dockerin-carrying cellulosome components [22], and that of the mesophilic strain C. cellulolyticum contains 71 putative dockerins (unpublished results). Unlike the dockerins of both the C. thermocellum and C. cellulolyticum cellulosomes, where the great majority are very similar in their sequences, the dockerin sequences of the R. flavefaciens FD-1 cellulosome can be divided into distinctive groups based on sequence divergence.Due to the wealth of the latter sequences, the various sequence features have been approached here by both bioinformatics tools and manual inspection, in order to provide further insight into their interrelationship and possible function. Some of the groups clearly have distinct sequence patterns, which are conserved within a few dozen dockerin modules, even though the latter originate from different parent proteins. The distribution of catalytic modules, binding modules and dockerin sequences predicted from the R. flavefaciens FD-1 draft genome confirms a dominant role for cellulosome organization among extracellular enzymes that are concerned with plant cell wall breakdown by this bacterium.The general role that is recognised for dockerins and cohesins is in mediating specific protein-protein interactions that result in the assembly of the multienzyme cellulosome complex. In another strain of this species, R. flavefaciens 17, previous studies have shown direct functional evidence for four specific interactions: (i) EndB-type dockerins with ScaA-type cohesins; (ii) the ScaB dockerin with the ScaE cohesin; (iii) the ScaA dockerin with ScaB-type cohesins; and (iv) the CE3B dockerin with the ScaC cohesin (Jindou et al 2006). However, these interactions likely represent but a portion of the total set of interactions, since the genome of strain 17 has yet to be sequenced; our current knowledge of the different types of cohesin-dockerin pairs is thus confined to the relatively small number of cellulosomal components thus far sequenced and the paucity of relevant experimental evidence thus far accumulated. Genome sequencing of R. flavefaciens FD1 has served both to broaden greatly the number of sequences available for this species and to emphasise that the known homologous sequences between the two strains are decidedly different. Homologs of some of the R. flavefaciens 17 dockerins were found to belong to distinct dockerin groupings characterised for R. flavefaciens FD-1. Thus, the EndB dockerin of strain 17 belongs to group 1, the ScaB dockerin to group 4a, the CE3B dockerin to group 3 and the ScaA dockerin to group 5.The uniquely large number of R. flavefaciens FD-1 dockerins and their patterns of conservation may reflect a mechanistic diversity of different cohesin-dockerin interactions. Truncated dockerins (such as these classified in group 2) may be active via a single-binding mode, while other types of dockerins may be recruited to specific polysaccharide-degrading functions of the bacterium, which are exclusive to the ruminal environment and were therefore not developed in other cellulolytic bacteria. It is also logical to assume that many dockerins were presumably subjected through evolution to strong selection forces and were duplicated within each group (for example in group 4b), thereby expanding the repertoire of dockerins in R. flavefaciens. Different cohesin-dockerin pairings may then reflect different evolutionary origins, with adaptive changes in R. flavefaciens helping to organise these different components into enzyme complexes that function effectively on a wide variety of plant cell wall material under the changing conditions of the rumen environment. Moreover, the different cohesin-dockerin pairings could play a critical role in structuring the complexes and in regulating the inclusion of the parent protein (notably the enzymes) into the complex in response to environmental signals. The numerical ratio in the same bacterium of a few dozens cohesins versus the two hundred dockerins reflects the key modular nature of cellulosomal structures and their complexity. Finally, it is entirely possible that certain interactions, for example some of those involving the group 4 dockerins, might play roles that are not directly related to cellulosome function, but to other unknown functions, perhaps including the structuring of the bacterial cell surface [34].The patterns which were observed in the dockerin-containing proteins provide another level of complexity to the R. flavefaciens FD-1 cellulosome. On the one hand, a large number of unknown domains were detected among all groups of dockerins as opposed to the status of the C. thermocellum genome, but on the other, catalytic modules (glycoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases, carbohydrate esterases and associated CBMs) were particularly associated with only a few select groups (1a, 1b and 3). Attempts to understand this complexity included inspection of the levels of gene expression, which mainly revealed that multi-modular proteins were mostly up-regulated in cells grown on cellulose versus growth on cellobiose.It is not possible, however, to simply equate dockerin clusters with their specificities. This question can only be answered through careful and extensive functional studies on the interactions between purified modules, and on the determinants of binding specificity. The current study provides the rationale for such experiments. The conserved differences between the different dockerins may be eventually reflected in their stability, function or expression within the context of the parent protein, in response to their role in the rumen environment.Assignment of dockerin ORFs to their groups.(0.14 MB DOC)Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.Funding: The Rowett Institute receives support from the Scottish Government Rural and Environment Research and Analysis Directorate.

PMC2930436,Adaptation to herbivory by the Tammar wallaby includes bacterial and glycoside hydrolase profiles different from other herbivores,False,"Author contributions: P.B.P., P.H., C.S.M., and M.M. designed research; P.B.P., S.E.D., M.J., S.G.T., and K.B. performed research; P.B.P., S.G.T., K.B., S.A.M., A.C.M., and J.-F.C. analyzed data; and P.B.P. and M.M. wrote the paper.Metagenomic and bioinformatic approaches were used to characterize plant biomass conversion within the foregut microbiome of Australia's “model” marsupial, the Tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii). Like the termite hindgut and bovine rumen, key enzymes and modular structures characteristic of the “free enzyme” and “cellulosome” paradigms of cellulose solubilization remain either poorly represented or elusive to capture by shotgun sequencing methods. Instead, multigene polysaccharide utilization loci-like systems coupled with genes encoding β-1,4-endoglucanases and β-1,4-endoxylanases—which have not been previously encountered in metagenomic datasets—were identified, as were a diverse set of glycoside hydrolases targeting noncellulosic polysaccharides. Furthermore, both rrs gene and other phylogenetic analyses confirmed that unique clades of the Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroidales, and Gammaproteobacteria are predominant in the Tammar foregut microbiome. Nucleotide composition-based sequence binning facilitated the assemblage of more than two megabase pairs of genomic sequence for one of the novel Lachnospiraceae clades (WG-2). These analyses show that WG-2 possesses numerous glycoside hydrolases targeting noncellulosic polysaccharides. These collective data demonstrate that Australian macropods not only harbor unique bacterial lineages underpinning plant biomass conversion, but their repertoire of glycoside hydrolases is distinct from those of the microbiomes of higher termites and the bovine rumen.Australia possesses the largest share of the world's extant marsupial species, which diverged from other eutherian mammals ≈150 million years ago. Most likely, the most widely recognized members of this group are the macropods (kangaroos and wallabies). The macropods also evolved in geographical isolation of other eutherian herbivores, and although they are often compared with ruminants, the various macropod species show a wide range of unique adaptations to herbivory. These differences include their dentition and mastication of food, as well as the anatomical adaptations of the forestomach that supports a cooperative host–microbe association that efficiently derives nutrients from plant biomass rich in lignocellulose (1). Compared with ruminant species, the hydrolytic and fermentative processes these microbes provide must be relatively rapid because of the continuous transit of plant biomass through the herbivore gut (2, 3). There is also a widespread belief—developed from several studies during the late 1970s—that Australian macropods generate less methane during feed digestion than ruminant herbivores (4, 5), indicative of some novel host and microbe adaptations of the macropods to herbivory. Indeed, the limited studies published to date suggest the foregut microbiomes of macropods possess unique protozoal, bacterial, and archaeal microorganisms (6–8); however, very little is currently known about the genetic potential and structure–function relationships intrinsic to these microbiomes.Metagenomics offers new opportunities to interrogate and understand this interesting host–microbe association. We present here a compositional and comparative analysis of metagenomic data pertaining to plant biomass hydrolysis by the foregut microbiome of Australia's model marsupial: the Tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii). Several unique bacterial lineages were identified and nucleotide composition-based sequence binning using Phylopythia facilitated the production of a 2.3 Mbp assemblage of DNA representing one of the unique Lachnospiraceae clades present in this community. Further in silico analysis revealed this clade harbors numerous putative glycoside hydrolases (GHs) specifically targeting the side chains attached to noncellulosic polysaccharides.An inventory of the various metagenomic resources created and analyzed as part of this study are summarized in Table S1. The rrs gene library is comprised of 663 bacterial sequences and included 236 phylotypes (using a 97% sequence identity threshold). Rarefaction analysis showed the bovine and macropod datasets afforded a similar degree of coverage of the biodiversity present in these microbiomes (Fig. S1). The overall community profile at a phylum-level is similar to that of other vertebrate herbivores, with representatives of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes being predominant (Fig. S2A). However, the majority of these phylotypes were only distantly related to any of the cultivated species from other gut microbiomes (Table S2). Furthermore, the comparison of these datasets via unweighted measures of β diversity, UniFrac analysis, and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) network maps clearly showed host-specificity, with only a small number of OTUs shared between the bovine and macropod microbiomes, and no OTUs shared with the termite sample (Fig. 1). We were also able to separate the macropod rrs gene library data with respect to time of collection, which revealed that the microbiome appeared to be more diverse in spring, most likely because of the availability of forb species during spring offering a greater amount of soluble carbohydrates, as compared with highly lignocellulosic biomass present in drier times of the year (Fig. 1 and Table S2). There were also five distinctive phylotypes identified from the rrs gene libraries: two of these were assigned as deeply branching, unique members of the γ-subdivision of Proteobacteria (hereafter referred to as Wallaby Group-1, WG-1); two more were positioned as a deeply branching and unique lineage within the Lachnospiraceae (hereafter referred to as Wallaby Group 2, WG-2); the last of these was a unique member of the Erysipelotrichaceae (Mollicutes), and is hereafter referred to as Wallaby Group-3, (WG-3) (Fig. S3 and Table S2). The archaeal populations have already been described in an earlier study (8) and are considerably smaller than those typically encountered in ruminants, and might be a key reason explaining the apparent differences between ruminants and macropods in terms of methane production during feed digestion (2, 4, 5).OTU network map showing OTU interactions between all rarefied samples from the Tammar wallaby (spring and autumn), rumen, and termite. Lines radiating from samples Rumen _FA_8, Rumen_FA_64, Rumen_FA_71, and Rumen_PL are colored blue (fiber-associated fraction and pooled liquid-associated, respectively, from ref. 13), Termite_PL3 colored red [termite lumen study (12)] and Tammar_Spring (T1) and Tammar_Autumn (T2) colored green (present study) are weighted with respect to contribution to the OTU. OTU size is weighted with respect to sequence counts within the OTU. (Inset) The first two principal coordinate axes (PCoA) for the unweighted UniFrac analysis colored by host animal: Rumen (FA_8, ■; FA_64, •; FA_71, ◆; PL, ) blue; Termite (▲) red and Tammar (Spring, ; Autumn,▼) green. For complete inventory and comparisons between the two Tammar wallaby sample dates at an OTU definition (SONS analysis), see Table S2.Similar conclusions were drawn from phylogenetic analysis of the Sanger shotgun sequence data. First, MEGAN (9) was used to perform a phylogenetic assignment of the first round of metagenomic data generated, which represented ≈30% of the total data produced (Fig. S2B). The majority of these reads were assigned to the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and the γ-subdivision of the Proteobacteria. We subsequently developed a collaborative partnership with the McHardy group and used the composition-based classifier Phylopythia (10) to examine the complete dataset, once it was produced. The fosmid libraries produced as part of this study were used to provide ~2.5 Mbp of training sequence for Phylopythia, which resulted in the classification of 76% of the contigs to at least the phylum level (Table 1). Again, the assignments favored the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and γ-subdivision of the Proteobacteria, and confirmed the predominance of the WG-1, WG-2, and WG-3 populations in the metagenomic data (Table 1). Indeed, these three groups, which comprise ~34% of the sequences that comprise the rrs gene libraries (Table S2), also accounted for ~22% of the total Phylopythia assignments. A small number of reads were also assigned to the Euryarchaeota and, in particular, Methanobrevibacter sp., consistent with the small population size of archaea measured for these same animals in ref. 8. Similar to the results presented for the termite and bovine microbiomes (12, 13), a very small number of sequences were also assigned to the Cyanobacteria.Phylogenetic profile of the Tammar wallaby metagenome sequence dataset, based on sequence composition-based binning using Phylopythia*Percentages are given at different taxonomic levels, therefore add up to more than 100%; data in shaded rows assigned to the sample-specific classes for the WG-1 (uncultured γ-Proteobacteria bacterium), WG-2 (uncultured Lachnospiraceae bacterium) and WG-3 (uncultured Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium) clades of the model; all other assignments are to classes trained from publicly available data.Despite these encouraging results, ≈60% of the Sanger reads subjected to MEGAN analysis and 61% of the Phylopythia assignments could not be extended deeper than an Order-level of classification, with ~20% having no assignments at any level. This “shallow” level of binning by both methods confirms the wallaby foregut microbiome is comprised of unique bacterial lineages, with only limited similarity to the (meta)genomic data derived from other microbial habitats and cultured isolates.The Tammar wallaby is a small macropod (4–10 kg), and primarily utilizes grasses and forbs as its principal source of energy nutrition (2). For many months of the year, such plant material is characteristically rich in lignocellulose and noncellulosic polysaccharides. The metagenomic data were subjected to automated annotation using Joint Genome Institute-Department of Energy's (JGI-DOE) integrated microbial genomes with microbiome samples (IMG/M) system; next, select functional categories were manually compared with the global hidden Markov models (HMMs) available via Pfam. These analyses recovered over 600 genes and modules from 53 different CAZy (Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes) families (11) (Table S3), but relatively few of these produced strong matches with endo- or exo-acting β-1,4-glucanases. Only 24 GH5 β-1,4-endoglucanases were identified from the metagenomic data, along with a smaller number of gene modules assigned to the GH6 and GH9 families (Table 2 and Table S3). In addition to these presumptive “cellulases,” the metagenomic data produced 25 sequences matching GH94 (cellobiose phosphorylase) catalytic modules. The number of “xylanase” genes identified in the metagenomic dataset was evenly distributed among the GH10, GH26, and GH43 families (Table 2). Furthermore, genes matching CE4 and AXE1 (Pfam) acetyl xylan esterases, “accessory enzymes” that are part of the xylanolytic system responsible for the complete hydrolysis of xylan, were also identified (Table S3). Interestingly, the GH11 xylanases, which are found in abundance among members of the Firmicutes, especially Clostridium and Ruminococcus spp., as well as specialist cellulolytic bacteria from other gut microbiomes, were absent from our datasets.GH profiles targeting plant structural polysaccharides in three herbivore metagenomesData are presented using the format described in ref. 40, with the GHs grouped according to their major functional role in the degradation of plant fiber. The numbers in parentheses represent the percentages of these groups relative to the total number of GH’s identified in the metagenomic datasets [557 for macropod, 704 for termite (ref. 12), and 957 for bovine (ref. 13)]. A complete inventory of the GHs recovered from the Tammar wallaby foregut microbiome is presented in Table S3. The column annotated as fosmids represents the number of additional GH genes identified from sequencing fosmid clones, as described in the materials and methods and results.Comparative analysis of the repertoire of GH families recovered from the Tammar, termite hindgut, and bovine rumen metagenomes revealed some interesting similarities and differences. The GH5 cellulases were numerically most abundant in the wallaby and termite metagenomes, with less representation of the GH9 family (Table 2). In contrast, the bovine metagenomic dataset was more evenly balanced with respect to these two GH families (Table 2) (12, 13). Similar to the rumen, the wallaby foregut microbiome possessed a large number of reads matching GH families specific for xylooligosaccharides and the side chains attached to noncellulosic polysaccharides (Table 2). The most abundant were GH1, GH2, and GH3 β-glycosidases, as well as matches with GH51 and GH67 enzymes, which typically target glucuronic acid and arabinose-containing side chains, respectively. The Tammar metagenome also contained a range of carbohydrate-active enzymes targeting pectic polysaccharides, plant pigments, gums, glycolipids, and other glycosides, including GH78 rhamnosidases, CE8 pectin methylesterases, several GH28 rhamnogalacturonases, and a pectate lyase (PL1) (Table S3). These findings were not entirely unexpected, given the dietary profiles of the macropod (predominantly grass and forbs, with a small amount of a commercial pellet mix) compared with termites (wood); the findings also partially explain the higher abundance of GH genes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the side chains of noncellulosic plant polysaccharides in the grass/legume feeding herbivores, compared with wood-eating termites (13).However, and despite the differences in nutritional ecology, gut anatomy, and microbiome structure, probably the most notable observation drawn from all these datasets is the virtual absence of genes encoding GH6, GH7, and GH48 β-1,4-exoglucanases (Table 2), which are essential in virtually all cultured bacteria and fungi for cellulose solubilization, as well as the dearth of cellulosome-associated modules, such as cohesins and dockerins (Table S3). Although the wallaby metagenome dataset does contain 42 Type I dockerin modules, all these modules were linked to hypothetical sequences of unknown function, with no examples linked to recognized GH catalytic modules, other carbohydrate-active enzymes, or serpins. Such findings suggest there is still much to learn about cellulose hydrolysis and dockerin-cohesin-mediated complex assemblies in gut microbiomes.There were 33 fosmids selected for 454 pyrosequencing on the basis that their inserts encode gene products resulting in carboxymethylcellulase or xylanase activity visualized in plate-screen assays. Phylopythia assigned the majority of the scaffolds produced from these clones to the Bacteroidales or Lachnospiraceae (Table S4). Twelve of these scaffolds possess genes encoding a GH5 catalytic module, two more encode a gene with a GH9 catalytic module, and one encodes a gene with a GH6 catalytic module. Interestingly, half of the scaffolds assigned to the Bacteroidales also possessed genes homologous to the polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) present in the genomes of Bacteroides and related genera (14–18). The presumptive PUL-like gene arrangement borne by one of these fosmids (annotated in Table S4 as part of scaffold 78) is shown as an example in Fig. 2, along with a hypothetical functional model of the cluster. In brief detail, the PUL-like gene cluster consists of an AraC-like regulatory protein, a putative acetylxylan esterase and two genes with homology to the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron susC (tonB) and susD genes. These latter two genes were initially defined as part of the starch utilization system (sus) of B. thetaiotaomicron (19, 20). The SusC protein is a tonB-dependent receptor family member, a group of outer membrane-spanning proteins that can import solutes and macromolecules into the periplasm (21, 22); the SusD protein coordinates polysaccharide binding at the cell surface (20). Two genes located directly downstream from the susC and susD homologs were predicted to be outer membrane lipoproteins and therefore might play a role similar to the B. thetaiotaomicron SusE and SusF proteins, whose functional role is currently unknown. The remaining six genes in this cluster encode putative glycoside hydrolases and a putative inner-membrane-bound “sugar transporter.” Although PULs were not readily assembled from our Sanger sequence data, there were 36 susC and 42 susD genes identified in the dataset (Table S3). For these reasons, we propose that the sus-like PULs represent a key adaptation to growth on cellulose and other polysaccharides by the large number of Bacteroidetes resident in the wallaby foregut. Interestingly, sus gene homologs were not identified in the termite hindgut and bovine rumen data, presumably because of the lower representation of Bacteroidetes in the termite and the short read lengths in the bovine dataset.Gene arrangement in the Bacteroidales-affiliated fosmid and a hypothetical model of polysaccharide-adhesion and hydrolysis coordinated by this gene cluster. (A) Phylopythia affiliated the fosmid clone from which scaffold 78 is derived to the order Bacteroidales, as described in the text. The putative PUL gene cluster consists of an AraC family transcriptional regulator (geneA), an acetylxylan esterase (geneB), susC and susD gene homologs (genes C and D, respectively), and two genes encoding outer membrane-targeted lipoproteins (genes E and F). Genes G, H, and I encode proteins containing GH26, GH5, and GH43 catalytic modules, respectively. Gene J encodes a putative inner-membrane bound “sugar transporter” followed by genes K and L, which encode proteins containing GH5 and GH94 catalytic modules, respectively. (B) The hypothetical model predicts that polysaccharides are bound by the outer membrane-associated components, principally via the SusD homolog in a complex with the SusC, and the two lipoproteins. The GH5-containing proteins generate oligosaccharides, which are transported across the outer membrane, principally via the protein complex described above. These oligosaccharides may be further hydrolyzed by periplasmic GHs or transported to the cytoplasm via a glycoside sugar transporter (encoded by gene J), before hydrolysis by glycoside hydrolases (gene M and I) or terminal phosphorolytic cleavage by the GH94 glycoside phosphorylase (encoded by gene L).Phylopythia supported a 2.3 Mbp assemblage of metagenome fragments assigned to the WG-2 population (Fig. S4 and Table S5). The current assemblage includes 20 different families of carbohydrate-active enzymes principally involved with the hydrolysis of noncellulosic polysaccharides and pectin. However, none of the sequences encoding dockerin modules were assigned to WG-2, suggesting no cellulosome complex assembly by this population. The assemblage includes genes encoding homologs of GH1, GH2, GH3, GH27, and GH42 catalytic modules, as well as several GH5 endoglucanases and GH94 cellobiose phosphorylases. Five GH43 arabinoxylosidases and several acetyl esterases genes (CE12) contiguous with GH78 rhamnosidases were also assigned to WG-2 (Table S5). Interestingly, arabinose-rich rhamnogalacturonan side chains have been speculated to play an essential role for some plant species to tolerate severe desiccation (23, 24). Given that many of Australia's native plant species are drought-tolerant or drought-resistant, WG-2 might have evolved to specialize in the hydrolysis and use of these types of poly- and oligosaccharides for growth. Indeed, Phylopythia also assigned genes encoding xylose isomerase and xylulokinase enzymes to the WG-2 assemblage, as well as acetate and butyrate kinases. From these data, we propose that the WG-2 population plays a quantitatively important role in both the degradation and fermentation of the pentoses derived from noncellulosic polysaccharides, and produces acetate and butyrate as fermentation end-products.Australia's native herbivores are recognized throughout the world for their unique attributes in diversity, form, and function, but our understanding of their evolutionary adaptations for niche occupation has been compromised because we had virtually no understanding of their gut microbiomes, which contribute greatly to the nutrition and well-being of these animals. Our metagenomic analyses of the Tammar wallaby foregut microbiome clearly shows these animals are the host for unique bacterial lineages that are numerically predominant within the microbiome. For example, the WG-2 lineage appears to play a key role in the deconstruction of noncellulosic poly- and oligosaccharides by producing a large number of enzymes targeting both heteroxylans and pectins. Furthermore, the functional screening of the fosmid libraries for cellulases and xylanases recovered clones assigned to the Bacteroidetes encoding PUL-like gene clusters, including susC and susD gene homologs linked with GH5 and/or GH10 genes. Such findings distinguish the Tammar wallaby foregut microbiome from that of the bovine rumen (predominantly Clostridiales and Prevotellas) and the termite hindgut (Fibrobacteres and Spirochetes). The collective findings from this and other metagenomic studies also still need to be reconciled with the extensive literature developed from the biochemical, molecular, and genomic analyses of specialist gut bacteria and fungi, which have created the cellulosome and free enzyme paradigms of cellulose solubilization. These paradigms are underpinned by a restricted number of known GH families, which remain poorly represented in metagenomic data. Much still remains to be learned about the structure-function relationships of these interesting microbiomes.The eight adult females (aged between 1.5 and 4 y) sampled for this study were all from the same colony maintained near Canberra, Australia. Three animals were sampled in November 2006 (late spring: T1) and another five in May 2007 (late autumn: T2). During this period the animals were provided free range access to pastures composed predominantly of Timothy Canary grass (Phalaris angusta) and were also provided with a commercial pellet mix containing wheat, bran, pollard, canola, soy, salt, sodium bicarbonate, bentonite, lime, and a vitamin premix (Young Stockfeeds). Animals were killed with an overdose of pentobarbitone sodium (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Sustainable Ecosystems Animal Ethics Approval Number 06–20) and foregut contents were either transferred to sterile containers and immediately frozen at −20 °C, or mixed 1:1 with phenol:ethanol (5%:95%).Before cell dissociation and DNA extraction, a subsample of each digesta sample was pooled and hereafter is referred to as T1 (November 2006) and T2 (May 2007). To desorb and recover those microbes adherent to plant biomass, 5 to 10 g of the pooled samples was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min, and the pellet was resuspended in dissociation buffer and subjected to a dissociation procedure described by ref. 25 (details provided in SI Materials and Methods). HMW DNA was extracted using a gentle enzymatic lysis procedure (details provided in SI Materials and Methods).Two rrs clone libraries were prepared from the metagenomic DNA samples extracted from T1 and T2 by using two different primer pairs broadly targeting the bacterial domain: 27F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′) and 1492R (5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′); and GM3 (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG C-3′) and GM4 (5′-TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′) (12) (details provided in SI Materials and Methods). Similar attempts produced archaeal rrs gene libraries with results described in ref. 8. A total of 663 near-complete bacterial rrs gene sequences passed the quality and chimera filters and were used in the subsequent analyses (details provided in SI Materials and Methods).The 663 sequences were aligned using the NAST aligner (26) and imported into an ARB database with the same alignment (http://greengenes.lbl.gov/) (27). Fifty-one partial and near complete 16S sequences were extracted from the Tammar metagenomic data set aligned using NAST aligner and also imported into ARB (28). Sequences were initially assigned to phylogenetic groups using the ARB Parsimony insertion tool. Phylogenetic trees (Fig. S2A and Fig. S3) were constructed from masked ARB alignments (to remove ambiguously alignable positions) using RAxML (29) and bootstrap analysis using parsimony and neighbor-joining was performed using 100 replicates. The phylum-level trees (Fig. S3) were reconstructed using TREE-PUZZLE (30) in ARB. The rrs gene sequences from the two libraries were assigned to phylotypes (OTUs) at 97 and 99% sequence identity thresholds using the DOTUR package (31) (Table S1) and comparisons at an OTU definition was calculated as a percentage using SONS (32) (Table S2). Additional phylogenetic comparisons and diversity estimates were performed using the QIIME package (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) (33), with OTUs at the 97% sequence identity threshold used (Fig. S1). Sample heterogeneity was removed by rarefaction before comparison of Tammar rrs gene sequences with rumen and termite samples. The OTU network maps were generated using QIIME and visualized with Cytoscape (34). In addition, α diversity [PD_Whole_Tree (35), observed species count and Chao1 richness estimators] and β diversity (unifrac weighted and unweighted) metrics along with rarefaction plots were also calculated using QIIME.Shotgun libraries from the Tammar genomic DNA were prepared from each of the pooled samples T1 and T2: a 2- to 4-kb insert library cloned into pUC18 and a roughly 36 kb insert fosmid library cloned in pCC1Fos (Epicentre Corp.). Libraries were sequenced with BigDye Terminators v3.1 and resolved with ABI PRISM 3730 (ABI) sequencers. Subsequent sequences were assembled with the Paracel Genome Assembler (PGA version 2.62, www.paracel.com) (details provided in SI Materials and Methods).Based on a number of functional and hybridization-based screens, 98 fosmids were chosen for sequencing. The individual fosmids were induced to increase their copy number following Epicentre protocols, and the fosmid DNA purified using Qiagen MiniPrep columns. Equimol amounts of the fosmids were pooled together (~20 μg total DNA) and both a 3-kb paired-end library and a 454 standard shotgun library were constructed. Both libraries were directly sequenced with the 454 Life Sciences Genome Sequencer GS FLX and assembled using Newbler (details provided in SI Materials and Methods).Putative genes in the Tammar wallaby gut microbiome metagenome were called with GeneMark (36) and putative genes in the fosmid assemblies were called with a combination of MetaGene (37) and BLASTX. All called genes were annotated via the IMG/M-ER annotation pipeline and loaded as independent data sets into IMG/M-ER (38) (http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/m/main.cgi), a data-management and analysis platform for genomic and metagenomic data based on IMG (39).MEGAN was used to determine the phylogenetic distribution of the first batch of 30,000 Sanger reads generated by the CSP program. BLASTX was used to compare all reads against the NCBI-NR (“non-redundant”) protein database. Results of the BLASTX search were subsequently uploaded into MEGAN (9) for hierarchical tree constructions which uses the BLAST bit-score to assign taxonomy, as opposed to using percentage identity. Assembled metagenomic contigs were binned (classified) using PhyloPythia (10). Generic models for the ranks of domain, phylum, and class were combined with sample-specific models for the clades “uncultured γ-Proteobacteria bacterium” (WG-1), “uncultured Lachnospiraceae bacterium” (WG-2), and “uncultured Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium” (WG-3) (details provided in SI Materials and Methods).Searches for GHs and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) were performed as described in ref. 12. Briefly, database searches were performed using HMMER hmmsearch with Pfam_Is HMMs (full-length models) to identify complete matches to the family, which were named in accordance with the CAZy nomenclature scheme (11). All hits with E-values less than 10−4 were counted and their sequences further analyzed. For those GH and CBM families for which there is currently no Pfam HMM, the representative sequences selected from the CAZy Web site and described by ref. 12 were used in BLAST searches of the metagenomic data to identify these GH and CBM families. An E-value cutoff of 10−6 was used in these searches. For phylogenetic analysis of selected GH families (GH5: Fig. S5), sequence alignments were first produced using HMMER hmmalign and to the corresponding Pfam HMM; next, a protein maximum likelihood program used with the Jones-Taylor-Thornton probability model of change between amino acids was applied to these data.Fosmid clones bearing β-1,4-endoglucanase and/or β-1,4-xylanase activity were detected by plating the Escherichia coli library on LB-chloramphenicol agar plate medium containing either 0.2% (wt/vol) carboxymethylcellulose or birchwood xylan (Sigma). Approximately 20,000 recombinant strains were plated in a 384-well format and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The plates were then stained with Congo red dye and destained with 1 M NaCl to reveal zones of hydrolysis. Positive colonies were isolated and reexamined to confirm activity. Twenty-seven fosmid clones positive for carboxymethylcellulose hydrolysis and six positive for xylan hydrolysis were selected for 454 pyrosequencing and assembly.We are especially grateful to the support from Lyn Hinds (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Australia) who assisted in sample collection.

PMC2939539,"Exploring laccase-like multicopper oxidase genes from the ascomycete Trichoderma reesei: a functional, phylogenetic and evolutionary study",False,"The diversity and function of ligninolytic genes in soil-inhabiting ascomycetes has not yet been elucidated, despite their possible role in plant litter decay processes. Among ascomycetes, Trichoderma reesei is a model organism of cellulose and hemicellulose degradation, used for its unique secretion ability especially for cellulase production. T. reesei has only been reported as a cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic organism although genome annotation revealed 6 laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) genes. The purpose of this work was i) to validate the function of a candidate LMCO gene from T. reesei, and ii) to reconstruct LMCO phylogeny and perform evolutionary analysis testing for positive selection.After homologous overproduction of a candidate LMCO gene, extracellular laccase activity was detected when ABTS or SRG were used as substrates, and the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity followed by biochemical characterization. The recombinant protein, called TrLAC1, has a molecular mass of 104 kDa. Optimal temperature and pH were respectively 40-45°C and 4, by using ABTS as substrate. TrLAC1 showed broad pH stability range of 3 to 7. Temperature stability revealed that TrLAC1 is not a thermostable enzyme, which was also confirmed by unfolding studies monitored by circular dichroism. Evolutionary studies were performed to shed light on the LMCO family, and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using maximum-likelihood method. LMCO and classical laccases were clearly divided into two distinct groups. Finally, Darwinian selection was tested, and the results showed that positive selection drove the evolution of sequences leading to well-known laccases involved in ligninolysis. Positively-selected sites were observed that could be used as targets for mutagenesis and functional studies between classical laccases and LMCO from T. reesei.Homologous production and evolutionary studies of the first LMCO from the biomass-degrading fungus T. reesei gives new insights into the physicochemical parameters and biodiversity in this family.Lignin degradation is a key step for recycling the carbon fixed by photosynthesis, and to date, basidiomycetes are the most efficient naturally-found lignin degraders [1,2]. Lignin attack is a complex oxidative process in which heme peroxidases oxidize lignin subunits using extracellular hydrogen peroxide generated by unrelated oxidases as a co-substrate. A second enzyme group involved in lignin degradation is the multicopper oxidases (laccases) that oxidize lignin subunits with molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor. Different fungal lignocellulose degradation strategies have been reported, and a better understanding of ligninolysis could be achieved by screening the ""computational biodiversity"" found in fungal genomes. Gene networks could then be highlighted and correlated to the lignin-degrading ability of different fungal strains. For this purpose, dedicated databases, namely CAZy [[3], http://www.cazy.org] and FOLy [[4], http://foly.esil.univ-mrs.fr] were designed to annotate the genes involved in the (hemi)cellulolytic and ligninolytic processes, respectively. In the FOLy database there is an inventory of laccases (benzenediol-oxygen-oxidoreductase, EC1.10.3.2), which are copper-containing oxidases able to oxidize a wide range of aromatic compounds [5,6]. Based on multiple sequence alignments of more than 100 laccases, four ungapped sequences regions (L1-L4) were evidenced in laccases [7]. The copper ligands include 12 amino acids that are housed within these conserved regions. Moreover, four loop regions (I, II, III, and IV) were identified and suggested to be involved in substrate binding on the basis of 3D structure superimposition [8].Phenols are typical substrates of laccases (syringaldazine, DMP and guaiacol) but laccases are also able to oxidize electron donor substrates such as ABTS [2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] or ferrocyanide [9,10].Laccases are attractive environmentally-friendly enzymes that have shown potential for a variety of applications. Laccases find potential applications in pulp delignification and biobleaching [11], dye-bleaching in the textile and dye industries [12], treatment of wastewater [13], removal of phenolic compounds in beverages [14], biosensor and biofuel cell construction [15] and products of pharmaceutical importance [16].Whereas laccases are well-known ligninolytic enzymes in basidiomycetes, their role in ascomycetes is still being unravelled. Potential laccases have been already reported in ascomycetes in which laccases were supposed to be involved in the melanin-like pigment synthesis in conidiospores, in the induction of fruiting bodies, and finally in pathogenic interaction with plants [17-22]. Complete annotations of the potential ligninolytic systems were recently produced using FOLy, providing initial comparative insight into the diversity of fungal lignin degradation [4]. Putative laccase-related genes (called LO1 according our classification) were interestingly identified in Trichoderma reesei and other ascomycetes. T. reesei is a mesophilic soft-rot ascomycete fungus producing high levels of cellulases and hemicellulases that are also commercially used to modify and hydrolyze plant cell wall polysaccharides. To date, no ligninolytic activity has been reported for this fungus.This paper reports overexpression of a laccase-like multicopper oxidase gene (LMCO) from T. reesei and the biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein. Secondly, phylogenetic reconstruction and evolutionary analyses (testing for positive selection) were performed to explore the biodiversity of this enzyme group in Ascomycotina.Escherichia coli JM 109 (Promega, Charbonnières, France) was used as plasmid host. T. reesei strain Rut-C30 [23] was used for homologous overexpression.After codon optimization, gene|124079| was synthesized, sequence-checked, and ligated in the expression vector pAMH110 after digestion with SacII and NdeI restriction enzymes. In this vector, the T. reesei cellobiohydrolase I-encoding gene (cbhI) promoter was used to drive the expression of the laccase gene. Fungal transformations were carried out essentially as described previously [24].T. reesei strains were maintained on potato dextrose agar (Difco, Sparks, MD, USA) slants. Transformants were regenerated on solid minimal medium containing, per liter: (NH4)2SO4 5.0 g, KH2PO4 15.0 g, CaCl2 0.45 g, MgSO4 0.6 g, CoCl2 3.7 mg, FeSO4.H2O 5 mg, ZnSO4.H2O 1.4 mg, MnSO4.H2O 1.6 mg, glucose 20 g as carbon source, sorbitol 182 g as osmotic stabilizer, and hygromycin 125 mg for selection. Plates were solidified and colony growth was restricted by adding 2% agar to the medium. Transformed protoplasts were plated in 3% selective top agar containing 1 M sorbitol.For screening of laccase activity on plates, transformants were plated on solid minimal medium with 200 μM ABTS. The plates were incubated for 7 days at 30°C and checked for development of a purple halo. In the shake flask cultivation, the transformants were grown in minimal medium containing, per liter: (NH4)2SO4 5.0 g, KH2PO4 15.0 g, CaCl2 0.6 g, MgSO4 0.6 g, CoCl2 3.7 mg, FeSO4.H2O 5 mg, ZnSO4. H2O 1.4 mg, MnSO4.H2O 1.6 mg, peptone 5 g, lactose 40 g, Solka floc cellulose (International Fiber Corporation, North Tonawanda, NY, USA) 20 g as carbon sources and inducers, and piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulphonate) 33 g. The pH was adjusted to 5 with KOH. The culture medium was inoculated with 1 × 107 spores per 50 ml and grown in baffled flasks at 30°C with stirring at 200 rpm. Aliquots (1 mL) were collected daily from liquid culture medium and cells were removed by filtration (0.45 μm). Laccase activity was subsequently measured.In the culture medium, laccase activities were determined quantitatively by monitoring the oxidation of 500 μM ABTS at 420 nm (extinction coefficient, 36000 M-1cm-1 ) in the presence of 50 mM Na-K-tartrate, pH 4.0 at 30°C. For optimal pH determination, laccase activity was also measured by following the oxidation of syringaldazine (SRG) [N,N'-bis-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzylidene)hydrazine] to quinone (ε = 65 000 M-1·cm-1) at 525 nm [25].The best-producer transformant was inoculated in the same conditions as in the screening procedure. Culture was harvested after 7 days of growth, filtered (0.7 μm), and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a polyethersulfone membrane (molecular mass cut-off: 30 kDa) (Millipore). The concentrate was dialyzed against the binding buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) and His-tagged recombinant protein was purified on a Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (13 × 15 cm; Amersham Biosciences) previously charged with 0.4 M NiSO4 solution, and equilibrated with five column volumes of binding buffer. After extensive wash with binding buffer, bound proteins were then eluted with 3 column volumes of an imidazole gradient (0-150 mM) in binding buffer at a flow rate of 1 mL.min-1 and collected with fractions of 5 mL.Protein concentration was determined according to [26] using bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein purification was followed by SDS/PAGE on 11% polyacrylamide slab gels that were then stained with Coomassie blue.Laccase activity of the purified TrLAC1 was assayed at various setpoint temperatures (range: 30°C to 60°C). For pH, laccase activity was assayed in 50 mM citrate/100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5-7.0), in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6-8) and in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 9) at 30°C. ABTS was used as substrate in both experiments, and syringaldazine was used to determine optimal pH.The effect of temperature on enzyme stability was studied by incubating pure enzyme from 30 min to 24 h at temperature ranging from 30°C to 50°C. After this treatment, residual enzyme activity was determined under standard conditions. The effect of pH on enzyme stability was studied by incubating pure enzyme for 30 min to 48 h at pH ranging from 3.0 to 7.0 in 50 mM citrate/100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5-7.0) and in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6-8) at 4°C. After this treatment, residual enzyme activity was determined under standard conditions.Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a JASCO model J-720 CD spectrometer equipped with a PTC-38WI Peltier thermally controlled cuvette holder. Far-UV (240-190 nm) CD measurements were performed with 2 μM enzyme in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.1 at 25°C, using a 1-mm cell and a bandwith of 1 nm. Spectra were accumulated four times and the values were corrected for buffer contributions.From the query sequence (gene|124079| reference to T. reesei genome database, JGI: http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Trire2/Trire2.home.html), a dataset of putative homologous sequences was built by BLAST [27] run on the Non Redundant database. The raw dataset was manually filtered to eliminate potentially non-homologous sequences, disturbing alignments and duplicates. Sequences retrieved were only focused on scope TaxeID = 4751 (fungal kingdom). An alignment was created using MUSCLE [28] and large gaps were manually eliminated. A default parameter for gap columns thresholds was set at 0.85. A bias correction phase was used to eliminate: i) sequences with a diverging composition, using an amino-acid composition test bundled with TREE-PUZZLE software [29] with an alpha risk set to 5%. From this alignment, a phylogenetic tree was generated using maximum likelihood methods [30]. Bootstrapping was carried out with 1000 replications.Protein and DNA sequences were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Protein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [28]. Correspondence between protein alignment and each DNA sequence was established using Wise2 software followed by manual adjustments [31]. The final alignment contained 290 codons for the dataset.The codeml program of the PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood; [37];) 3.15 software package was applied to test for positive selection. PAML uses a maximum likelihood algorithm to assign likelihood scores to different models for selection. If a model incorporating positive selection gave a higher likelihood score than a null model without positive selection, this constitutes evidence for positive selection. Model A implemented by Yang & Nielsen was used [33]. This model enables ω (= dN/dS) to vary both between sites and between lineages, and was implemented in the maximum likelihood framework. Branch A tested for positive selection was labelled as foreground branch, and all remaining branches were labelled as background branches. This model was then used to construct two likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) by comparison against models that do not identify positive selection. The null hypothesis for test 1 is the site model M1a [34,35] which assumes two site classes with 0 < ω0 < 1 and ω1 = 1 for all branches. For test 2, the null hypothesis is the branch-site model A but with ω2 = 1 fixed. Positively-selected sites were identified by the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) method [34].Genome annotation of T. reesei QM6a was performed using the FOLy database. Annotation was focused on enzymes potentially involved in the degradation of lignin and related aromatic compounds. Surprisingly, 6 genes were annotated as laccase-like multicopper oxidase encoding genes (LMCO): jgi|124079|, jgi|122948|, jgi|5119|, jgi|54239|, jgi|102820| and jgi|121098|. Among these candidate genes, model 124079 was selected for further functional investigation for its characteristic motif identification and sequence similarity with classical laccase proteins. This gene is 2193 bp in length and contains 5 introns. The genomic context of this gene was studied to exclude the possibility that it is a pseudogene. The promoter sequence contained CAAT and TATAA boxes at -658 and -109, respectively. Searches for specific regulatory elements revealed 21 heat-shock elements (HSE) and one nitrogen metabolite regulation (NIT2-like). Interestingly, two putative metal response elements and one xenobiotic response element involved in laccase gene regulation in white-rot fungi were identified but located downstream of the ATG (+41; +102 and +11, respectively). The functionality of these regulatory elements needs to be experimentally verified. The corresponding protein, called TrLAC1, contains 623 aa and possesses a classical signal peptide of 20 aa. Structure prediction of TrLAC1 is similar to laccases from basidiomycetes such as Trametes species and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus (data not shown).Codons of gene|124079| were optimized to perfectly fit the general Trichoderma reesei codon usage. Non-optimized and optimized DNA sequences showed an identity of 77,9%. The signal sequence of the laccase genes itself was used in the expression cassette. Six histidine codons were introduced to the C-terminus to provide a tag for subsequent protein purification. Gene expression was regulated by the inducible cbh1 promoter and chb1 terminator. T. reesei RUTC-30 was co-transformed with the genetic cassette including gene|124079|cloned in the expression vector PAMH110, and a vector containing the hygromycin resistance selection marker. Transformants were selected for their ability to grow on solid minimum medium containing hygromycin. Transformants were first screened on plates based on the appearance of purple halos flagging ABTS oxidation. Secondly, approximately 125 colonies were screened by assaying laccase activity in the culture medium, and the best producer was selected for further analysis. The best-producer transformant was then cultured to study the time course of laccase activity. Laccase activity against ABTS was detected on day 2 and the activity increased until day 6 having the maximum activity of 0.6 nkat.mL-1. According to the specific activity determined for the purified enzyme, production yield was 280 mg.L-1.The electrophoretic mobility of the total secreted proteins in the culture medium was checked on SDS-PAGE (Figure ​(Figure1).1). Compared against the negative control (supernatant from wild-type strain, Figure ​Figure1,1, lane a), an additional band was visualized at ~104 kDa in the TrLAC1 transformant (Figure ​(Figure1,1, lane b). Recombinant TrLAC1 was purified through a one-step chromatographic strategy (IMAC). The homogeneity of the recombinant TrLAC1 was controlled by SDS-PAGE (Figure ​(Figure1,1, lane c) and a single ~104 kDa band was detected. The deduced molecular mass of the predicted mature TrLAC1 is ~67 kDa, thus the experimental molecular mass of TrLAC1 could originate from variable mobility in SDS gel analysis and cellular processing such as glycosylations (the mature sequence reveals 6 consensus sites for N-glycosylation). Identification of the recombinant TrLAC1 was confirmed by tryptic digestion followed by MALDI-TOF analysis (data not shown). When the extracellular protein patterns of the parental strain and the best tranformants (Figure ​(Figure1,1, lanes a and b) were compared, it is evident that the most abundant band corresponding to the cellobiohydrolase CBHI is missing from the transformant. This indicates that the expression construct has replaced the cbh1 gene by homologous recombination in this transformant.SDS-PAGE of extracellular proteins and purified TrLAC1. Total proteins from wild-type strain (lane a) and TrLAC1 transformant (lane b) were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE (11% polyacrylamide) gel. Gel was stained with Coomassie blue. L, molecular mass standards.The optimum temperature and pH of TrLAC1 was measured by assaying its activity at different temperature and pH values using ABTS as a substrate. The optimum temperature was 40-45°C and optimum pH was 4 (Figure ​(Figure2a2a and ​and2b).2b). Activity towards the canonical laccase substrate syringaldazine (a phenolic compound) was also determined and optimum pH was pH 7.Effect of temperature (a) and pH (b) on the activity of the purified TrLAC1. Various temperatures and pH values were tested under standard conditions by using ABTS ""blue diamond"" and SRG ""pink square"" as substrates.TrLAC1 was incubated for different times at different temperature and pH values and subsequently the residual activity was measured. The enzyme conserved its activity at 30°C after 3-hr incubation but TrLAC1 lost approximately half of its activity after 24 h (Figure ​(Figure3a).3a). TrLAC1 is not a thermostable enzyme. At 35°C and 40°C, 30% and 66% of enzymatic activity, respectively, was lost. At 45°C, laccase activity was totally lost after 2 hours. However, TrLAC1 showed good stability within a pH range of 3 to 7 (Figure ​(Figure3b3b).Effect of temperature (a) and pH (b) on the stability or the purified TrLAC1. Selected temperatures were 30°C ""blue diamond"", 35°C ""pink square"", 40°C ""yellow triangle"", 45°C ""blue cross"", 50°C ""purple star"" and the selected pH values were 3 ""blue diamond"", 4 ""pink square"", 5 ""yellow triangle"", 6 ""blue cross"", 7 ""purple star"".The kinetic parameters of the recombinant TrLAC1 were determined using Lineweaver-Burk plot method by using ABTS as substrate (Table ​(Table1).1). Km, and Vmax were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis as 0.137 mM and 9.37 nkat.mL-1, respectively. Specific activity equals 2.13 nkat.mg-1.Properties of TrLAC1 from T. reeseiThe far-UV CD spectra of TrLAC1 under native and thermally denaturing conditions were compared as an indicator of the secondary structure. Figure ​Figure44 showed that the spectra measured at 25°C differed from the spectra measured at 90°C, suggesting that the native TrLAC1 exist in a conformational state with significant secondary structure. Moreover, thermal stability (30 to 90°C) was assessed using CD by following the change at 222 nm (data not shown). Although very broad with no clear folded-unfolded transition state, it was evident that the protein is not thermostable, which is in agreement with the data from the residual activity measurements.CD spectra of TrLAC1. measured under native (solid line) and thermal denaturing conditions (dashed line).All the homologous proteins of TrLAC1 from T. reesei were selected from non-redundant databases and integrated into phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood for phylogenetic reconstruction. The high bootstrap values confirmed robust tree topology. Phylogenetic analysis clearly differentiated two distinct groups containing the laccases of Basidiomycota and Ascomycota, TrLAC1 belonging to the latter group. According to the tree topology, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota groups belong to two different evolutionary histories leading to high sequence divergence between homologs. The Ascomycotina group is split into two subgroups with a high bootstrap value of 862 (Figure ​(Figure5).5). No complete functional characterization has yet been carried out in the Ascomycotina group. This study on TrLAC1 provides therefore a biochemical investigation in the Ascomycotina group that could facilitate future functional annotation in the clade by functional inference.Phylogenetic reconstruction of homologous sequences for TrLAC1. Basidiomycotina laccases branch is labelled as a and is considered as the foreground branch for branch-site models.The Basidiomycotina group is divided in two subgroups (bootstrap values of 1000) including the classical laccases (Pycnoporus, Trametes) involved in ligninolysis and the laccase from the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans involved in the biosynthesis of melanin as a virulence factor.In order to shed light on the differences between classical laccases and LMCO from Ascomycotina as studied in this work, we hypothesized that positive selection occurred along the lineage leading to classical Basidiomycotina laccases, and the branch was labelled a. The purpose of this analysis was to test for positive selection along the branch leading to ligninolytic enzymes, i.e. laccase, and to evidence sites under positive selection.The branch-site model A was applied to test evolutionary shift by maximum likelihood analysis. Branch a was considered as the foreground branch and all others as background branches in the phylogenetic tree. Parameter estimates under model A suggested that 39.3% of sites were under positive selection with ω2 = 14.2, whereas 10.2% of sites were under the neutrality assumption with ω1 = 1 fixed, and finally 50.3% of sites were highly conserved with ω0 = 0 (Table ​(Table2).2). The likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) gave 2Δl = 33.78 with P < 10-4 and df = 2 for the test comparing model A to model M1a (neutral) and 2Δl = 6.84 with P < 10-2 and df = 1 for the test comparing model A to model A with ω2 = 1 fixed. Therefore, LRTs confirmed that results were highly significant.Parameter estimates for the treeNote: p is the number of free parameters for the ω ratios. Parameters indicating positive selection are presented in boldtype. Sites potentially under positive selection were identified using laccase from P. cinnabarinus ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AAF13052"",""term_id"":""6466835"",""term_text"":""AAF13052""}}AAF13052) according to Bayes Empirical Bayes analysis of Model A.These results demonstrated that positive selection occurred, and the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) test identified 16 sites under positive selection along the branch leading to classical laccases, at a probability level of >90%. These results show that positive selection drove the evolution of sequences leading to well-known laccases involved in ligninolysis. Among these sites, 14 are not conserved in the TrLAC1 sequence, meaning that these sites could be targeted for mutagenesis and functional studies between classical laccases and LMCO from T. reesei (and more generally from Ascomycotina).A large number of microbial genomes relevant to lignocellulose degradation are currently being sequenced [36]. Among them, T. reesei is a model organism of fungal decay of cellulose and hemicellulose, and its enzymes were demonstrated to have potential in production of bioethanol and other biological products from biomass. T. reesei is widely used for its unique secretion ability, especially for cellulase production. T. reesei fungus possesses 10 genes encoding well-known cellulases (endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases) and 16 genes that encode hemicellulase genes classified in several CAZyme families [3,37]. T. reesei has never before been considered as a potentially lignin modifying fungus. The study of an endogenous LMCO in T. reesei, the biotechnological workhorse of the genus Trichoderma, is therefore of interest for the multiple biotechnological applications using this fungus and is important in an ecological context [38].In literature, there are several records of laccases production by ascomycetes. In the genus Trichoderma (T. atroviride and T. harzianum), laccase activity was correlated with the production of the green pigment in conidial spores [39]. Laccase activity has also been evidenced in the tropical xylariaceous fungi that are probably responsible for the lignocellulolysis despite their slow decay ability in vitro [40]. In addition, laccases were purified from phytopathogenic ascomycetes such as Gaeumannomyces graminis [41], Magnaporthe grisea [42]Ophiostoma novo-ulmi [43]Mauginiella [44]Monocillium indicum [45], Neurospora crassa [46].Concerning recombinant enzyme production, the expression of an ascomycete laccase-encoding gene from Melanocarpus albomyces was reported in T. reesei and the recombinant protein characterized [21]. Additionally, heterologous expression of a thermostable laccase from the ascomycete Myceliophtora thermophila was successfully achieved in Aspergillus oryzae [47].Fungal LMCOs could play physiological roles in lignin degradation in addition to other functions, such as iron metabolism, pathogenic interactions, pigment synthesis in conidiospores, in the induction of fruiting bodies and in offensive/defensive strategies during interactions of fungi [17-20,48,49].The annotation of T. reesei genome using the FOLy database revealed the presence of laccase-like multicopper oxidase genes (LMCO) related to laccase sequences from Basidiomycetes (Levasseur et al., 2008a). To date, no expression of these genes has been evidenced in T. reesei, and it could be hypothesized that a specific expression pattern strictly constraints expression.Homologous overproduction assays were conducted for the gene jgi|124079|. The supernatant of the transformed strain showed laccase activity and the corresponding recombinant protein was named TrLAC1. Biochemical characterization revealed that this enzyme is active on typical specific laccase substrates including ABTS and syringaldazine. Interestingly, TrLAC1 has a higher pH optimum spectrum on syringaldazine compared to most of the other basidiomycete laccases (i.e. Pycnoporus cinnabarinus). The optimal pH of TrLAC1 is similar to laccases from the basidiomycete Cyathus stercoreus and the ascomycete Melanocarpus albomyces that have been reported to have optimal pH of 6-7 by using syringaldazine [50,51].Interestingly, optimum pH differed strikingly according to the substrate used as the optimum pH was 7 with the phenolic substrate syringaldazine and 4 with the nonphenolic substrate ABTS. Such a behaviour has already been reported for other fungal laccases and could be explained by two phenomena: one generated by the redox potential difference between a reducing substrate and the type 1 copper of laccase and another generated by the binding of a hydroxide anion to the type 2/type 3 coppers of laccase [52,53].In a biotechnological point of view, TrLAC1 represents a candidate for applications at alkaline pHs such as bioremediation of textile wastewaters and of wastewaters produced by chemical plants in the manufacturing organic molecules [54]. Nevertheless, TrLAC1 had a low specific activity on ABTS as compared to basidiomycete laccases. For instance, P. cinnabarinus laccase has a specific activity ~800 times higher on ABTS than TrLAC1 [55]. Positively selected sites in TrLAC1 could be specifically targeted in future to study their impact in the enzymatic efficiency.There are surprisingly few studies focused on the diversity and function of LMCO genes in soil-inhabiting ascomycetes, despite their probable role in plant litter decay processes [56-58]. In order to screen the gene biodiversity of potential laccases from Ascomycotina, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using maximum likelihood analysis. Numerous homologs of TrLAC1 were observed in the Ascomycotina group, especially in the Aspergilli. For instance, Aspergillus niger CBS513.88 has 5 potential candidate homologous genes similar to LMCO. Interestingly, a paralog was identified in T. reesei (jgi|54239|). In an evolutionary point of view, functional characterization of this candidate protein could be useful to understand the evolution of LMCO in T. reesei and to unravel the fate of duplicates in genome. Functional characterization has not been performed in the Ascomycotina group, and TrLAC1 characterization could therefore be useful for future evolutionary-based functional annotation [4,59].In order to shed light on the evolutionary history of laccases, branches leading to well-known ligninolytic laccases were targeted for testing selective pressure. Positive selection was detected, and specific sites were evidenced. Comparing these positively-selected sites to the laccase from Ascomycotina could target potential sites for future directed mutagenesis research. Hybrid laccases combining Ascomycotina sequences and positively-selected sites identified in Basidiomycotina could prove useful for testing new physico-chemical properties for biotechnology applications [60,61]. In addition, testing positively-selected sites could be valuable in drawing a parallel between functional and evolutionary shifts in the multi-copper family.T. reesei, the biotechnological workhorse of the genus Trichoderma, has only been reported as a cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic organism. This work reports homologous overexpression of the first LMCO from T. reesei and the biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein. In addition, phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses were carried out to explore the biodiversity of this enzyme group in Ascomycotina. Positive selection was detected, and specific sites were evidenced and could be specifically targeted in future to study their impact in the enzymatic efficiency.

PMC2944797,An Insect Herbivore Microbiome with High Plant Biomass-Degrading Capacity,False,"Herbivores can gain indirect access to recalcitrant carbon present in plant cell walls through symbiotic associations with lignocellulolytic microbes. A paradigmatic example is the leaf-cutter ant (Tribe: Attini), which uses fresh leaves to cultivate a fungus for food in specialized gardens. Using a combination of sugar composition analyses, metagenomics, and whole-genome sequencing, we reveal that the fungus garden microbiome of leaf-cutter ants is composed of a diverse community of bacteria with high plant biomass-degrading capacity. Comparison of this microbiome's predicted carbohydrate-degrading enzyme profile with other metagenomes shows closest similarity to the bovine rumen, indicating evolutionary convergence of plant biomass degrading potential between two important herbivorous animals. Genomic and physiological characterization of two dominant bacteria in the fungus garden microbiome provides evidence of their capacity to degrade cellulose. Given the recent interest in cellulosic biofuels, understanding how large-scale and rapid plant biomass degradation occurs in a highly evolved insect herbivore is of particular relevance for bioenergy.Leaf-cutter ants form massive subterranean colonies containing millions of workers that harvest hundreds of kilograms of leaves each year. They use these leaves to grow a mutualistic fungus that serves as the colony's primary food source. By farming fungus in specialized garden chambers, these dominant Neotropical herbivores facilitate rapid large-scale plant biomass conversion. Our understanding of this degradation process, and the responsible microbial community, is limited. In this study, we track the degradation of plant polymers in leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens and characterize the microbial community potentially mediating this process. We show that cellulose and hemicelluloses are degraded in the fungus gardens and that a previously unknown microbial community containing a diversity of bacteria is present. Metagenomic analysis of this community's genetic content revealed many genes predicted to encode enzymes capable of degrading plant cell walls. The ability of leaf-cutter ants to maintain an external microbial community with high plant biomass-degrading capacity likely represents a key step in the establishment of these ants as widespread, dominant insect herbivores in the Neotropics. This system is an important model for understanding how microbial communities degrade plant biomass in natural systems and has direct relevancy for bioenergy, given recent interest in cellulosic biofuels.Plant cell walls contain the largest reservoirs of organic carbon on Earth [1]. This carbon is largely inaccessible to most organisms, occurring in the form of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. Certain bacteria and fungi are capable of deconstructing these recalcitrant plant polymers, and thus play a critical role in nutrient cycling in the biosphere. Lignocellulolytic microbes form symbiotic relationships with animals that feed on plant biomass, providing their hosts with access to nutrients in return for a constant supply of plant polymers. Recent microbiome studies have revealed how these communities mediate plant biomass deconstruction in animals, including detritivores [2], ruminants [3], and omnivores [4]–[6]. Here, we characterize the microbiome of an important Neotropical herbivore, the leaf-cutter ant Atta colombica.
Leaf-cutter ants in the genus Atta are one of the most conspicuous and widespread insects in the New World tropics, forming massive colonies composed of millions of workers. Mature colonies forage hundreds of kilograms in leaves each year (Figure 1A), substantially altering forest ecosystems and contributing to nutrient cycling [7]. Leaf-cutter ants do not feed directly on harvested leaves; rather, they use leaf fragments as substrate to cultivate a mutualistic fungus in specialized subterranean gardens (Figure 1B and 1C). The fungus serves as the primary food source for the colony and in return is provided with substrate, protection from competitors, and dispersal through colony founding [7]–[9]. Despite the impact of these ants on tropical ecosystems, and the critical role leaves play in Atta colonies reaching immense sizes, our current understanding of plant biomass deconstruction within fungus gardens is limited.Leaf-cutter ants forage for leaves (A) that they use to cultivate a fungus in specialized gardens (B) within their massive colonies (C). Sugar composition analysis of the plant biomass from the top and bottom layers of multiple fungus garden chambers shows an overall decrease in average content for many of the components of hemicellulose (D) and cellulose (E). In contrast, lignin (F) exhibited no change in average content. Error bars in graphs are standard error of the mean. The asterisks indicate a significant decrease in overall average content between top and bottom samples (two-tailed paired t test, P<0.05). [Photo credits: river of leaves, used under the GNU Free Documentation License CC-BY-SA-3.0,2.5,2.0,1.0; exposed fungus garden, Jarrod J. Scott/University of Wisconsin-Madison; concrete nest, Wolfang Thaler].The primary function of leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens is to convert plant biomass into nutrients for the ants: it serves as the ants' external digestive system [10]. Fungus gardens have a clear distinction between the top layer, which retains the green, harvested state of plant leaves; and the bottom layer, which contains mature fungus and partially-degraded plant material. This difference is due to the temporal process of plant biomass transformation by the ants; freshly-harvested leaves are integrated into the garden top, while material at the bottom is removed by the ants and placed into specialized refuse dumps. Plant biomass degradation in the garden is thought to be mediated exclusively by the ants' mutualistic fungus (order: Agaricales), but its recently reported inability to degrade cellulose [11] poses the question as to what plant polymers are degraded in the fungus garden matrix. We sampled the top and bottom layers of fungus gardens from five colonies of Atta colombica leaf-cutter ants in Gamboa, Panama and performed sugar composition analyses. Our quantification of plant biomass polymer content from these layers revealed that crystalline cellulose and sugars representing various plant polysaccharides, such as hemicelluloses, decreased in content from garden top to bottom (Figure 1D and 1E), whereas lignin did not (Figure 1F). Cellulose in particular, had one of the highest percent decreases, dropping by an average content of 30% from the top to the bottom of the garden.Our finding that certain plant cell wall polymers are consumed in the fungus garden, including cellulose, which is not known to be degraded by the fungal cultivar, suggests that other microbes may be partially responsible for this deconstruction; a prediction consistent with previous reports of cellulase activity of unknown origin within the fungus garden [12], [13]. We explored this possibility by characterizing the fungus garden microbial communities of three A. colombica leaf-cutter ant colonies using near-full length 16S rDNA clone sequencing, short-read SSU rDNA pyrotag sequencing, and whole community metagenome sequencing. A total of 703 and 2,794 near full-length bacterial 16S rDNA sequences were generated for fungus garden top and bottom layers, respectively (Table S1), and short-read pyrotag sequencing of the same samples yielded 8,968 and 11,362 sequences, respectively. PCR using full-length Archaea-specific primers failed to amplify Archaeal 16S rDNA. Community metagenome sequencing of whole fungus gardens using pyrosequencing [14] generated over 401 Mb of sequence (Table S2), and assembly resulted in 155,000 contigs and 200,000 singletons, totaling 130 Mb.These DNA sequences indicate the presence of a diverse community of bacteria in leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens (Figure 2, Figure S1, Figure S2). Full-length 16S rDNA libraries contained 132 phylotypes (97% sequence identity) from 9 phyla in garden tops (Figure 2A, Table S3), and 197 phylotypes from 8 phyla in garden bottoms (Figure 2B, Table S3). Comparison of the phylogenetic diversity between top and bottom layer samples using UniFrac [15] indicates that the top layer diversity is different from bottom layer diversity (Figure S3). Both top and bottom layers were dominated by phylotypes in the α-proteobacteria, β-proteobacteria, γ-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes (Figure 2 and Figures S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8), which collectively contributed 80% (117 of 148 phylotypes) and 85% (185 of 217 phylotypes) of the bacterial diversity detected from top and bottom samples, respectively. A comparison of total generated sequences from these phyla further confirms that these phylotypes are abundant, with 92% (645 of 703 clones) and 91% (2540 of 2794 clones) of all sequenced clones belonging to these 5 lineages for top and bottom samples, respectively. Data from 16S rDNA short-read sequences also confirmed these findings, and further revealed rare phylotypes not found in the full-length analysis, including members of the candidate phyla NC10 [16], OP10 [17], and TM6 [18] (Table S4). Bacterial diversity comparisons among colonies and vertical layers revealed a number of consistent phylotypes, the majority of which are γ-proteobacteria (Figure S9, Figure S10, Table S5). Interestingly, the full-length 16S rDNA libraries revealed phylotypes in the Gemmatimonadetes and candidate phylum SPAM [19] (2 phylotypes each; Figure 2A) exclusive in garden tops, whereas phylotypes in the Chloroflexi and candidate phylum TM7 [20] (1 phylotype each; Figure 2B) were only detected in the garden bottoms. The short-read 16S rDNA sequences confirmed these findings (Table S4), suggesting that specific phyla may play specialized roles within vertical layers of the garden.A phylogenetic analysis of near-full length 16S rDNA sequence libraries from the top (A) and bottom (B) layers of leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens was performed. Identified phylotypes were tabulated and mapped to their respective phyla as shown. Total numbers of phylotypes are shown to the right of each phylum, and the total number of clones for each phylum is shown in square brackets. Comparison of top and bottom layers indicates that leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens are dominated by phylotypes belonging to the α-proteobacteria, β-proteobacteria, γ-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and the Bacteroidetes as highlighted. Phylotypes belonging to specific phyla were found exclusive to top and bottom samples, including the Gemmatimonadetes and candidate phylum SPAM (blue lettering) in the top, and the Chloroflexi and candidate phylum TM7 (red lettering) in the bottom of the garden.Our phylotype diversity analyses were further confirmed through community metagenomics, which does not suffer from the PCR bias inherent to 16S rDNA sequencing [21]. Phylogenetic binning of our community metagenome (Table 1 and Table S6) using a number of different approaches including the program PhymmBL [22], indicates that the fungus garden is dominated by γ-proteobacteria (30% of total bacterial sequences), α-proteobacteria (16%), Actinobacteria (9%), δ-proteobacteria (7%), and β-proteobacteria (7%) (Figure S11, Table S7, Text S1). In particular, the most highly represented sequences are from γ-proteobacterial genera in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Our phylogenetic binning analysis also revealed DNA sequences predicted to be derived from insects, fungi, and plants (Figure S12, Table S2, Table S8, Text S1). It is likely that these sequences originate from the ants, their fungal symbiont, and their primary plant feedstuffs, although genome sequences are currently not available for comparison.To identify how the fungus garden microbial community associated with leaf-cutter ants mediates plant polymer degradation, we performed a carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) [23] characterization of the garden community metagenome. This analysis identified 69 gene modules across 28 families of glycosyl hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases, and polysaccharide lyases (Table 2). In total, 58% of the sequences predicted to code for enzymes putatively involved in plant polymer degradation, including cellulose and hemicellulose, were of bacterial origin. These enzymes include β-mannosidases (GH1), α-galactosidases (GH1, GH4, GH57), and cellulases (β-1,4-glucanase; GH8), suggesting that bacteria are important contributors to plant polymer degradation within leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens.†: Pfam, http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk.‡: Number of detected CAZymes (correlated to Pfams) in the leaf-cutter ant fungus garden metagenome.We further explored the underlying mechanisms for plant biomass deconstruction in leaf-cutter ants by comparing the predicted bacterial CAZy profile of the fungus garden metagenome with those of 13 other metagenomes from similar environments that exhibit biomass degradation including animal guts and soil. Clustering analysis of these profiles showed that the fungus garden metagenome groups closest to bovine rumen [3] (Figure 3A). Comparison of shared CAZymes between these two metagenomes revealed enzymes involved in amylose (GH57), galactan (GH4), mannan (GH1), maltose (GH65), pectin (CE8), and xylan (CE4, GH26, GH31) deconstruction (Table S9). Many of these oligosaccharide polymers are components of hemicelluloses and other carbohydrates known to be degraded in both bovine rumen [24] and leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens (Figure 1D). Our CAZy profile clustering reveals the importance and similarity of carbohydrate degradation in these two microbiomes, as these metagenomes did not group together in a similar clustering analysis involving entire gene content (Figure 3B, Figure S13, Table S10, Table S11, Text S2).Comparative clustering of the leaf-cutter ant fungus garden community metagenome with 13 other metagenomes. The predicted proteome from each metagenome was compared using carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) profiles (A) and clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) profiles (B). CAZy and COG profiles for each metagenome was generated and clustered using Pearson's product moment. An unrooted tree (UPGMA) was then generated using PHYLIP and visualized using phylodendron.Despite leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens and bovine rumen utilizing similar plant biomass, leaves and grass, the microbial communities in these systems are markedly different. In the bovine rumen, the majority of resident bacteria are in the genera Prevotella (phylum Bacteroidetes), Fibrobacter (phylum Fibrobacteres), and Ruminococcus (phylum Firmicutes) [25], whereas leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens primarily contain bacteria from the Proteobacteria (Figure 2, Table S7). The similarity in carbohydrate-degrading potential between these two microbiomes is surprising, and the difference in their bacterial communities suggests that there is evolutionary convergence of enzymatic approaches for the deconstruction of at least some plant polymers. Given that there currently are a limited number of plant biomass degrading metagenomes available for comparison, and that the microbiomes used in our analysis were generated using different sequencing technologies and DNA extraction methods, which we are unable to account for (a difficulty that has been previously noted [26]), it is likely that future work may reveal other microbiomes exhibiting CAZyme profiles more similar to leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens than the bovine rumen. Nevertheless, this analysis provides insights into how two microbial communities that utilize similar plant biomass deconstruct polysaccharides.To further examine the role of cellulolytic bacteria in leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens we characterized representative isolates of Klebsiella and Pantoea, the two most abundant bacterial genera identified in our community metagenome (Table 1, Table S6). We sequenced the genomes and analyzed the predicted proteomes of Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b (Table S12); two isolates obtained from the fungus gardens of Atta cephalotes leaf-cutter ants. Both genomes contained a number of sequences predicted to code for enzymes known to be involved in plant polymer degradation, including cellulases (β-1,4-glucanase; GH8), β-galactosidases (GH2), chitinases (GH18), α-xylosidases (GH31), α-mannosidases (GH47), α-rhamnosidases (GH78), and pectinesterases (CE8) (Table S13, Table S14). Bioassays on pure cultures of these bacteria further revealed their capacity to degrade cellulose (Table S15), suggesting that Klebsiella and Pantoea may play a role as cellulose-degrading symbionts in the gardens of leaf-cutter ants. The symbiosis between these bacteria and leaf-cutter ants is further supported by previous work, which showed they can be consistently isolated from fungus gardens across the diversity and geography of leaf-cutter ants [10]. Indeed, these bacteria appear to be responsible for a significant amount of the nitrogen that is fixed in leaf-cutter fungus gardens; nitrogen that has been shown to be integrated into the ants [10]. Our finding that Klebsiella and Pantoea are the most abundant bacteria present in the gardens of A. colombica; genomic and physiological support for their capacity to degrade cellulose; and previous reports of their contributions to fixed nitrogen in leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens, provides evidence that these bacteria are important symbionts of leaf-cutter ants.Because our fungus garden metagenome and Klebsiella and Pantoea genomes originate from different Atta species, we examined the potential strain diversity of these symbionts by performing a recruitment analysis [27]. This was done by comparing the community metagenome reads against the microbial genome collection and our Klebsiella and Pantoea genomes (Figure 4A and 4B). Of all 887 genomes analyzed, the genus Pantoea had the highest number of recruited reads (2,064), while Klebsiella had the third highest (1,226) (Table S16). Mapping of the recruited reads specific to Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b onto their respective genomes showed markedly different results. For Klebsiella, 90% of the reads recruited to Klebsiella variicola At-22 had sequence identities >98%, indicating that both Atta species possess Klebsiella symbionts with highly-similar genomes (Figure 4A, Figure S14, Table S16). In contrast, only 4% of the Pantoea recruited reads had sequence identities >98% (Figure 4B, Figure S14, Table S16). This supports previous findings that multiple Pantoea species exist in leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens [10]. Further comparison of the two γ-proteobacteria GH8 cellulases identified in the community metagenome (Table 2) against the genomes of Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b showed that they matched sequences in these genomes with identities of 99% and 87%, respectively. These data indicate that these two symbionts are present in the fungus gardens of both Atta species where they may play a role as cellulose-degrading symbionts.Leaf-cutter ant fungus garden metagenome recruitment analysis. Reads from the leaf-cutter ant fungus garden community metagenome are shown mapped onto the draft genome sequences of the two leaf-cutter ant bacterial symbionts Klebsiella variicola At-22 (A) and Pantoea sp. At-9b (B). The sequence identity of each recruited read is as follows: blue, 95%–100%; magenta, 90%–95%; yellow, 85%–90%; gold, 80%–85%, and red, 75%–80%. The draft genomes are represented as concatenated contigs in order of decreasing size, and the corresponding coordinates are shown in the second-most inner ring. The average GC content for these draft genomes are shown in the innermost ring with green representing above-average GC content, and olive representing below-average GC content.Our study presents the first functional metagenomic characterization of the microbiome of an insect herbivore. We reveal that the microbial community within the fungus gardens of leaf-cutter ants contains not only the fungal cultivar, but a diverse assembly of bacteria dominated by γ-proteobacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae. We further show that these bacteria likely participate in the symbiotic degradation of plant biomass in the fungus garden, indicating that the fungal cultivar is not solely responsible for this process, as has been previously assumed. This suggests a model of plant biomass degradation in the fungus garden that includes both bacteria and the fungal cultivar, and we speculate that persistent cellulose-degrading bacterial symbionts like Klebsiella and Pantoea could work in concert with the fungal cultivar to deconstruct plant polymers.As an external digestive system, the fungus garden of leaf-cutter ants parallels the role of the gut in other plant biomass degrading systems like bovines and termites. The presence of a bacterial community dominated by Proteobacteria in leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens is similar to the gut microbiota reported for other insect herbivores, suggesting that bacteria in this phylum may be widespread in their association with herbivorous insects [28]–[30]. However, in contrast to other insect herbivores, the external nature of the leaf-cutter ant digestive system removes the restrictions imposed by the physical limitations of internal guts. This feature is likely responsible for these ants achieving massive colony sizes that harvest vast quantities of plant biomass to support their extensive agricultural operations. As a result, these herbivores have a considerable impact on their surrounding ecosystem by contributing significantly to the cycling of carbon and nutrients in the Neotropics. This study of the leaf-cutter ant fungus garden microbiome illustrates how a natural and highly-evolved microbial community deconstructs plant biomass, and may promote the technological goal of converting cellulosic plant biomass into renewable biofuels.A total of 25 fungus gardens from 5 healthy colonies (5 gardens each) of the leaf-cutter ant Atta colombica were collected at the end of May and beginning of June, 2008. These colonies are located along Pipeline Road in Soberanía National Park, Panama (latitude 9° 7′ 0″ N, longitude 79° 42′ 0″ W) and designated N9, N11, N12, N13, and N14, respectively. Each fungus garden was vertically cross-sectioned into thirds with the top third designated as the “top” of the garden and the bottom third designated as the “bottom” of the garden. All material was frozen and transported back to the University of Wisconsin-Madison where it was stored at −20°C prior to processing.From all 5 colonies (3 gardens per colony), 5 independent samples from fungus garden tops and bottoms of each garden were collected for sugar composition analysis. Thus, a total of 75 fungus garden samples each from the top and bottom were used for this part of our study. This material was tested for crystalline cellulose and hemicellulose (matrix polysaccharide) content as follows.Cellulose content of fungus garden plant biomass was determined by first washing each sample using Updegraff reagent [31], which removes matrix polysaccharides such as hemicelluloses, pectins and amorphous glucan. The remaining residue, containing only crystalline cellulose, was hydrolyzed using Saeman hydrolysis [32]. The resulting glucose monosaccharides were then quantified with an anthrone colourmetric assay as previously described [32].For the composition of the matrix polysaccharide content, the following components were tested: arabinose, fucose, galactose, glucose, rhamnose, mannose and xylose. Quantification of these sugars were performed by treating finely ground materials with solvents to remove pigments, proteins, lipids, and DNA from the material as previous described [33]. The residue was de-starched with an amylase treatment, resulting in only cell wall material. This material was then treated with 2M trifluoroacetic acid solubilizing the matrix polysaccharides in form of their monosaccharides, and subsequently derivatized into their corresponding alditol-acetates, which were separated and quantified by GC-MS as previously described [34].The same set of samples used for sugar composition analysis was also used for lignin content analysis, as previously described [35]. Briefly, all samples were dried to 60°C and ground using a 1-mm cyclone mill and analyzed for total non-lignin organic matter, lignin, and ash (organic and inorganic) content. Total carbohydrate content was assessed through a two-step acid hydrolysis with neutral sugars quantified using GC and uronic acids quantified using colorimetry. Klason lignin was quantified from the ash-free residue from the two-step acid hydrolysis. Ash content was quantified by combustion at 450°C for 18 h and the average µg/mg of material was calculated.Total DNA was extracted in preparation for either 16S rDNA sequencing or community metagenomic sequencing. For 16S rDNA sequencing, a total of 5 gardens each from 3 Atta colombica colonies (N9, N11, and N12) were used. A total of 1 g (wet weight) of fungus garden material was sampled from the top layer of each garden corresponding to each colony, for a combined final weight of 5 g of fungus garden material. Total DNA from this sample was then extracted using a MoBio Power Soil DNA Extraction Kit (MOBIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The same procedures were performed for all fungus garden bottom layer samples for all 3 colonies.For community metagenomic sequencing, total community DNA was extracted from 5 whole fungus gardens each from all 5 Atta colombica colonies used in this study. A total of 1 g of fungus garden material was sampled from top, middle, and bottom layers from all fungus gardens and combined to produce a final sample weight of 75 g. This material was then enriched for bacteria using a modification of a previously-described protocol [36]. Briefly, total fungus garden material was buffered in 1X PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4) containing 0.1% Tween and then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 40×g. This resulted in a 3-layer mixture containing leaf-material at the top, fungal mass in the middle, and bacteria at the bottom. The top and middle layers were carefully removed, buffered with 1X PBS containing 0.1% Tween, and washed using the same centrifugation method an additional 3 times. The final mixture was then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 2800×g, re-suspended in 1X PBS containing 0.1% Tween and filtered through a 100 um filter. Total DNA from this resulting sample was then extracted using a Qiagen DNeasy Plant Maxi Kit (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA).Extracted DNA from fungus gardens was PCR amplified (20 cycles) using full-length universal bacterial (27F [5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′] and 1391R [5′- GAC GGG CRG TGW GTR CA-3′]) and archaeal (4aF [5′- TCC GGT TGA TCC TGC CRG-3′] and 1391R [5′- GAC GGG CRG TGW GTR CA-3′]) primers and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) (See http://my.jgi.doe.gov/general/protocols/SOP_16S18S_rRNA_PCR_Library_Creation.pdf). This was then sequenced using standard Sanger-based capillary sequencing and assembled as previously described [2] (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/protocols/prots_production.html). These same samples were then pyrosequenced by first PCR amplifying all samples with prokaryote-specific primers corresponding to the V6-V8 region (1492R [5′- TAC GCY TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T - 3′] and 926F [5′- AAA CTY AAA KGA ATT GAC GG - 3′] fused to 5-base barcodes (reverse primer only) and 454-Titanium adapter sequences) and then sequenced on a Roche 454 FLX GS Titanium pyrosequencer [14]. All 16S rDNA sequences generated in this study are deposited in GenBank with accessions {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide-range"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HM545912-HM556124"",""start_term"":""HM545912"",""end_term"":""HM556124"",""start_term_id"":""326638523"",""end_term_id"":""326648735""}}HM545912-HM556124 and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide-range"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HM556125-HM559218"",""start_term"":""HM556125"",""end_term"":""HM559218"",""start_term_id"":""307122631"",""end_term_id"":""307125724""}}HM556125-HM559218 for near full-length 16S rDNA sequences and pyrotagged 16S rDNA sequences, respectively.Assembled full-length 16S contigs were first compared against the National Center for Biotechnological Information's (NCBI) non-redundant nucleotide (nt) and environmental nucleotide (env_nt) databases (accessed: 05/01/2009) using BLAST [37] to verify that all sequences were bacterial. A small number of eukaryotic 18S sequences belonging to the fungus the ants cultivate, Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, which were likely amplified due to the cross-reactivity of the 16S primers, were removed. No sequences identified as archaeal were detected from our library generated using archaeal-specific primers, and only bacterial sequences were amplified. Sequences were prepared for alignment by orienting each sequence in the same direction using the computer program Orientation Checker [38], putative chimeras were removed using Bellerophon [39], and each set was de-replicated to remove exact duplicates.Finalized sets for each sample were then analyzed using the ARB [40] software environment as follows. All full-length 16S rDNA sequences were imported and then aligned using the ARB fast-aligner tool [40] against a user-constructed PT-Server (constructed from the SILVA [41] 16S SSU rDNA preconfigured ARB reference database with 7,682 columns and 134,095 bacterial sequences; accessed: 01/15/2009). The full alignment was manually curated using the ARBprimary editor (ARB_EDIT4) in preparation for phylogenetic and community analysis. Once an acceptable alignment was obtained we created a PHYLIP [42] distance matrix in ARB using the filter-by-base-frequency method (column filter; minimal similarity  = 50%; gaps ignored if occurred in >50% of the samples; 1,320 valid columns). The PHYLIP distance matrix was exported to the MOTHUR software package v.1.5.0 [43] for community analysis and OTU designation. Briefly, the distance matrix was read into MOTHUR and clustered using the furthest neighbor algorithm. From here, we performed rarefaction, rank-abundance, species abundance, and shared analyses. Representative sequences from each OTU at 97% were re-imported into ARB for phylogenetic analysis (Figure S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8). We used a Maximum Likelihood (RAxML [44]) method for all phylogenetic analyses (normal hill-climbing search algorithm) and the above-mentioned method for positional filtering. Closest taxonomic assignment of clones was performed using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) [45] by comparing sequences against the type strain database (Table S5).For pyrotagged short-read 16S rDNA sequences, all sequences were compared against the National Center for Biotechnological Information's (NCBI) non-redundant nucleotide (nt) and environmental nucleotide (env_nt) databases (accessed: 05/01/2009) using BLASTN. Sequences were then classified as either bacterial, archaeal, or eukaryotic, and only those bacterial sequences (20,330) were retained for further analysis.These sequences were then processed through Orientation Checker, chimeras removed using the program Mallard [38], and subsequently analyzed using MOTHUR in the following fashion. First the entire dataset was de-replicated to eliminate duplicate sequences. The remaining sequences were aligned in MOTHUR against the Greengenes [46] reference alignment (core_set_aligned.imputed.fasta; 7,682 columns, accessed: 09/11/2009) using the Needleman alignment method with the following parameters: k-tuple size  = 9; match  = +1; mismatch penalty  = −3; gap extension penalty  = −1; gap opening penalty  = −5. Sequences were then screened to eliminate those shorter than 400 bp (gaps included). Filtration eliminated 7,062 columns resulting in a total alignment size of 620 bp (gaps included). The remaining dataset was again de-replicated to eliminate duplicate sequences and we constructed a furthest-neighbor distance matrix in MOTHUR using the twice de-replicated, filtered, alignment. All subsequent analyses (rarefaction, rank-abundance, species abundance, and shared analyses) were performed in MOTHUR using this distance matrix.A UniFrac [15] analysis was performed on all full-length 16S rDNA samples generated in this study, including 3 from the top and 3 from the bottom of fungus gardens. MOTHUR was used to generate phylip distance matrices and the computer program Clearcut [47] was then employed to construct neighbor-joining trees. UniFrac was then used to compare these samples as shown in Figure S3.Whole community DNA was used to create a shotgun library which was then sequenced using a single pyrosequencing plate on a Roche 454 FLX GS Titanium sequencer. Assembly of the data was performed using the 454 de novo assembler software with default parameters. Total amounts of data generated and statistical coverage is presented in Table S2. Raw sequence reads generated for this microbiome are deposited in NCBI's Short Read Archive under Study Accession SRP001011.1, and assembled contigs and singletons have been deposited into DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ADWX00000000"",""term_id"":""306396680""}}ADWX00000000.The complete set of assembled contigs and singletons representing the fungus garden community metagenome was phylogenetically binned using the following approach. First, the metagenome was compared against NCBI's non-redundant nucleotide (nt) and environmental nucleotide (env_nt) databases (accessed: 05/01/2009) using BLASTN (e-value: 1e-05) and the top hit was retained. The designated phylogenetic classification of the top hit for each contig and singleton was then assessed and binned into one of the following 4 sets: Bacterial, Eukaryotic, Viral, or Unknown. We then performed in-depth phylogenetic binning of the bacterial portion of the fungus garden community metagenome using the current microbial genome collection (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi, accessed: 05/15/2009). We reasoned that using the current microbial genome collection is a likely a more accurate metric for classifying the bacterial set at the genus level because each genome in this collection is correctly annotated and the current iteration of this collection contains both phylogenetic breadth and depth for many represented genera. As a result, we performed two different phylogenetic bins using the current microbial genome collection.First, GeneMark [48] was used to predict open reading frames and their corresponding translated proteins of the bacterial portion of the fungus garden community metagenome using a generic bacterial gene model. This predicted proteome was then compared against a local database containing all proteomes in the current microbial genome collection (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi, accessed: 05/15/2009) supplemented with the predicted proteomes of two bacterial strains (Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b, see below) isolated from the fungus gardens of a related leaf-cutting ant species, Atta cephalotes. Comparison of the fungus garden proteome against our microbial reference database was done using BLASTP (e-value: 1e-05) and the phylogenetic identity of the top hit was recorded. The total number of proteins was then tabulated to the genus level. Total nucleotide coding content for each predicted protein was then calculated to determine the total amount of nucleotide represented in each bin.Second, we performed phylogenetic binning on the bacterial portion of the fungus garden metagenome using the entire nucleotide content of the current microbial genome collection (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi, accessed: 05/15/2009), and again supplemented with the nucleotide content from the draft genome sequences of our two bacterial isolates from Atta cephalotes leaf-cutter ant fungus gardens. Using complete nucleotide content of the current microbial genome collection is advantageous because it includes both coding and intergenic regions, and provides a more robust measure of phylogenetic identity. We compared the entire bacterial portion of the fungus garden metagenome against this database using BLASTN (e-value: 1e-05) and the phylogenetic identity of the top hit was recorded. The total number of contigs and singletons was then tabulated to the genus level and the corresponding nucleotide amounts were also calculated. Furthermore, we performed this same analysis using all high-quality reads from our fungus garden community metagenome. Finally, we employed the phylogenetic binning program PhymmBL [22], which resulted in similar phylogenetic binning results as our comparison against the sequenced genome collection.We performed GC content analysis on the Bacterial, Eukaryotic, and Unclassified phylogenetic bins of the leaf-cutter ant fungus garden community metagenome. For the bacterial set, we divided the sequences according to the NCBI Taxonomic Groups Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, α-proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, β-proteobacteria, and γ-proteobacteria. We then calculated their GC content, and tabulated the total number of sequences within each group corresponding to each percentage as shown in Figure S11. For Eukaryotic sequences, these were divided into fungal, metazoan, and plant classifications and GC content analysis was also performed as shown in Figure S12. Furthermore, this same analysis was performed for the unclassified portion of the community metagenome and plotted alongside our Eukaryotic GC content analysis.The predicted proteome from the bacterial portion of the fungus garden community metagenome was annotated using the carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZy) database [23] as follows. A local database of all proteins corresponding to each CAZy family from the CAZy online database (http://www.cazy.org/, accessed: 06/01/2009) was constructed, and this was used to align the predicted proteome of the bacterial portion of the fungus garden community metagenome using BLASTP (e-value of 1e-05). This proteome was then annotated against the protein family (Pfam [49]) database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/mmdb/cdd/, accessed: 05/01/2009) using RPSBLAST [50] (e-value: 1e-05). A CAZy to Pfam correlation list was then compiled based on the secondary annotations provided through the CAZy online database. Finally, only those proteins that had significant BLAST hits to a protein from our local CAZy database and its corresponding Pfam were retained and designated as a carbohydrate-associated enzyme.A similar process was performed using the eukaryotic portion of the fungus garden metagenome. However, because of the difficulty in accurately predicting proteins from this subset, due to the lack of good gene models, we compared the contigs and singletons in this subset to our local CAZy and Pfam databases using BLASTX (e-value: 1e-05). Only those hits with significant matches to a protein from our local CAZy database, and its corresponding Pfam were retained and designated as a carbohydrate-associated enzyme in this set.To determine the similarity of the fungus garden community metagenome with respect to other sequenced metagenomes, we performed a comparative analysis using protein domain and carbohydrate enzyme content as a comparative metric, as previously described [51]. In general, the predicted proteome from the bacterial portion of the fungus garden metagenome was annotated according to clusters of orthologous groups (COGs [52]) database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/mmdb/cdd/, accessed: 05/01/2009) using RPSBLAST (e-value: 1e-05). The predicted proteomes from the following 13 metagenomes were also annotated in the same manner: bovine rumen [3], chicken cecum [53], fish gut and slime [54], gutless worm [55], human gut (Gill) [6], human gut (Kurokawa) [56], Minnesota soil [51], lean mouse [5], obese mouse [5], termite hindgut [2], wastewater sludge USA [57], sastewater sludge OZ [57], and whale fall [51]. The COG profiles from all of these metagenomes were divided according to their COG gene category designations and plotted as a proportion as shown in Figure S13. Cluster analysis of COG profiles for these metagenomes were performed as follows. A matrix was generated with each row corresponding to a metagenome and each column corresponding to a COG ID. The proportion of each COG with respect to the total number of annotated COGs in that metagenome was calculated and populated in the appropriate cell of the matrix. Spearman's rank correlation was then applied to this matrix to generate a similarity matrix correlating each metagenome to each other based on the similarity of each metagenome's COG profile. A distance matrix was then calculated using the neighbor program from the computer suite Phylip [42] (using the UPGMA method), and the resulting unrooted tree was visualized using the phylodendron tree drawing program (http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/treeapp/, accessed 07/25/2009). This same analysis was also performed using protein domains (Pfam) and no discernable difference in metagenome groupings was detected (data not shown).A similar approach was used for clustering these metagenomes according to CAZy content. Each metagenome's predicted proteome was annotated using CAZy and correlated to its Pfam annotation as described above. Because each protein potentially encodes for domain that belong to multiple CAZy families (i.e. a protein may contain both a GH and a CBM), we assigned multiple CAZy annotations to a particular protein. A carbohydrate enzyme matrix was then constructed with each row corresponding to a metagenome sample and each column corresponding to a CAZy family. Each cell in this matrix was then populated with the proportion of each CAZy family with respect to the total number of annotated CAZy families in each respective metagenome. Generation of an unrooted tree using this matrix was then constructed using the same procedure outlined for clustering based on the protein domain content metric.Pure isolates of Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b were cultured from the fungus gardens of the leaf-cutter ant Atta cephalotes, as previously described [10]. Genomic DNA from these isolates were extracted, as previously described [10]. Draft genomes of Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b were sequenced at the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) using a random shotgun approach through a combination of 454 standard and paired-end pyrosequencing (454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company) and 36 bp read Illumina sequencing (Illumina, Inc.). Sequencing using 454 was performed to an average depth of coverage of 30X for both Klebsiella and Pantoea. All general aspects of library construction and sequencing performed at the JGI can be found at http://www.jgi.doe.gov. A draft assembly for Klebsiella variicola At-22 was compiled based on 459,192 reads; for Pantoea sp. At9b, a draft assembly was constructed using 557,748 reads. The Phred/Phrap/Consed software package (http://www.phrap.com) was used for sequence assembly and quality assessment of both drafts [58]–[60]. After the shotgun stage, reads were assembled with parallel Phrap (High Performance Software LLC). Automated annotation of these draft genomes were performed by the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Group of the Biosciences Division of the U.S. Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory as described at http://genome.ornl.gov/. The draft genome sequence and annotation for Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CP001891"",""term_id"":""288887617""}}CP001891 and ACYJ00000000, respectively.The full set of reads used for the assembly of the fungus garden community metagenome was used to generate a recruitment plot against the draft genomes of Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b, two isolates we cultured from the fungus garden of the leaf-cutter ant Atta cephalotes
[10], as previously described [27] . Briefly, the contigs from each draft genome were concatenated together in ascending size to produce a “pseudogenome”, and the reads from the fungus garden community metagenome were aligned against a database containing both pseudogenomes, and all genomes from the current microbial genome collection (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi, accessed: 05/15/2009) using BLASTN. The top hit for each read was retained, and categorized to each genome. We then mapped reads corresponding to Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b onto each organism's respective psuedogenome and further binned them according to their sequence identities as follows: 95%–100%, 90%–95%, 85%–90%, 80%–85%, and 70%–80%. Visualization of the mapped reads onto each respective draft genome was performed using the DNAPlotter software package [61].A CAZy analysis was performed on the predicted proteomes of Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b using the same approach as described for CAZy analysis of the leaf-cutter ant fungus garden community metagenome. Furthermore, both GH8 cellulases from each of these genomes were compared against the CAZyme of the fungus garden community metagenome at the nucleotide level using BLASTN (e-value: 1e-05).Bioassays were performed on pure cultures of Klebsiella variicola At-22 and Pantoea sp. At-9b to determine their capacity to degrade cellulose. These include carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) assays and growth on microcrystalline cellulose. CMC assays were performed as previously described [62]. Briefly, pure cultures of both bacteria were inoculated onto yeast malt extract agar (YMEA, 4 g yeast extract, 10 g Bacto Peptone, 4 g Dextrose, 15 g agar) and grown at 25°C for 2 days. Single colonies were then spotted onto carboxymethyl cellulose plates (15 g agar, 5 g carboxymethyl cellulose [Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA]). Detection of cellulose degradation on CMC was performed using congo red, and the ability of each isolate's capacity for cellulose degradation was measured based on the zone of clearing present on the plate. Growth on microcrystalline cellulose was performed by inoculating 10 µl of pure culture into 150 µl of microcrystalline cellulose broth (1 L water and 5 g cellulose powder microcrystalline cellulose [MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH]) and growth was measured using a DTX 880 Multimode Detector Plate Reader (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) at an absorbance of 595 for 2 days. Positive growth on microcrystalline cellulose was correlated to an increase in the measured absorbance over this period.Rarefaction analysis of the leaf-cutter ant fungus garden full-length 16S rDNA sequences.

PMC2954214,Viewing the human microbiome through three-dimensional glasses: integrating structural and functional studies to better define the properties of myriad carbohydrate-active enzymes,False,"Recent studies have provided an unprecedented view of the trillions of microbes associated with the human body. The human microbiome harbors tremendous diversity at multiple levels: the species that colonize each individual and each body habitat; the genes that are found in each organism’s genome; the expression of these genes and the interactions and activities of their protein products. The sources of this diversity are wide-ranging and reflect both environmental and host factors. A major challenge moving forward is defining the precise functions of members of various families of proteins represented in our microbiomes, including the highly diverse carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) involved in numerous biologically important chemical transformations, such as the degradation of complex dietary polysaccharides. Coupling metagenomic analyses to structural genomics initiatives and to biochemical and other functional assays of CAZymes will be essential for determining how these as well as other microbiome-encoded proteins operate to shape the properties of microbial communities and their human hosts.The human body is home to trillions of microorganisms, most of whom reside in our gastrointestinal tracts. A century ago, Arthur Kendall wrote the multiplicity of types and variety of physiological requirements of this intestinal flora are … a strong reminder of the influence which the unrestrained activity of these organisms might conceivably exercise upon the general condition of the host (Kendall, 1909 ▶). Fast-forward 100 years and culture-independent metagenomic studies are now generating a tsunami of DNA-sequence data characterizing the genetic components of our microbiomes. For example, recent reports have described the results of (i) surveying the microbial composition of 27 different body-habitat-associated communities within and between multiple individuals over time (Costello et al., 2009 ▶); (ii) deeply sequencing the human gut microbiomes of genetically identical and unrelated individuals (Qin et al., 2010 ▶; Turnbaugh et al., 2010 ▶); (iii) analyzing ethnic variations in vaginal microbiomes (Ravel et al., 2010 ▶) and (iv) producing reference databases composed of hundreds (and soon to be thousands) of genome sequences from cultured representatives of various human microbiota (Nelson et al., 2010 ▶).While these human microbiome projects (HMPs) are rapidly expanding the number of gene sequences being deposited in public databases, as is the case with the human genome project there are significant challenges in developing efficient and economical strategies for exploiting these data in order to gain insights into the functions of protein products and how they contribute to human physiology, physiological variations, disease risk and disease pathogenesis. Addressing these challenges requires an integration of many experimental approaches, ranging from functional metagenomics (Craig et al., 2010 ▶; Uchiyama & Miyazaki, 2009 ▶; Sommer et al., 2009 ▶, 2010 ▶) to high-throughput genetic screens to identify determinants of symbiont fitness in a given microbial community or host context (Goodman et al., 2009 ▶) and structural genomics initiatives targeted to various groups of microbiome-specified proteins (see papers in this issue).One issue that potentially confounds the design of microbiome-directed structural genomic ‘campaigns’ is the incredible amount of microbial organismal and genetic diversity found in communities occupying various human-body habitats. A recent deep sampling, using culture-independent metagenomic methods, of the fecal microbiota of an adult monozygotic female twin pair revealed an estimated 800–900 bacterial species in each co-twin, less than half of which were shared by both individuals (Turnbaugh et al., 2010 ▶). Expanding this analysis to include a shallower sampling of 281 fecal samples obtained from 54 monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs and their mothers revealed >4000 gut-associated species-level phylo­genetic types (phylotypes). However, of the 134 bacterial species whose relative abundance was >0.1% in at least one fecal community, only 37 were detected in more than half of the biospecimens collected in this survey of ∼150 individuals.Deep shotgun pyrosequencing of fecal community DNAs prepared from the monozygotic twin pair referred to above yielded >100 000 protein-coding gene clusters. Only 17% of the clusters identified in this combined 10.1 Gbp data set were shared between these ‘genetically identical’ individuals; 49% encoded hypothetical proteins (no assignable COG, GO-term, TIGRfam or Pfam annotations) and only 36% had significant matches to known or predicted proteins present in the genomes of 122 cultured members of the human gut microbiota (Turnbaugh et al., 2010 ▶).Annotation of the genes identified in this deeply sampled gut-microbiome data set using the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) database (Cantarel et al., 2009 ▶) disclosed 143 different CAZy families encoded by 5145 genes (Turnbaugh et al., 2010 ▶). The revealed CAZyme repertoire emphasizes two themes emerging from present-day explorations of the human gut microbiome: substantial interpersonal variation and the disclosure of unanticipated functions. For example, genomic segments from the genus Faecalibacterium in the microbiome of one co-twin contained a number of genes encoding predicted cellulases [members of glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5), GH9, GH44 and GH48] plus 42 genes encoding putative dockerins (small proteins that aid in the assembly of extracellular cellulosomes; Bayer et al., 2008 ▶). These genes were notably absent in her co-twin’s microbiome or in a draft genome assembly produced from F. prausnitzii strain M21/2. Pyrosequencing reads homologous to predicted dockerins were found in 18 other human fecal microbiomes, representing six sets of adult monozygotic twins and their mothers, but varied in their abundance between individuals within and between families (Turnbaugh et al., 2010 ▶).Tallying the results of the metagenomic analysis of these gut-microbiome data sets from families containing monozygotic twins has so far yielded 156 CAZy families (including 77 glycoside hydrolase, 21 carbohydrate-binding module, 35 glycosyltransferase, 12 polysaccharide lyase and 11 carbohydrate esterase families). This means that CAZymes represent on average 2.6% of the sequenced genes in each microbiome (Turnbaugh et al., 2009 ▶). In contrast, the human genome encodes at best 20–25 digestive enzymes from CAZy families GH1 (lactase), GH13 (α-amylase) and GH31 (maltase, isomaltase and sucrase). Thus, with the exception of starch and sucrose, our ability to digest dietary plant carbohydrates resides entirely in our gut microbiomes.The CAZymes represented in different human populations consuming different diets may be influenced by their varied cultural traditions. This point is illustrated by a recent study that started out by investigating the polysaccharide-degrading capabilities of Zobellia galactanivorans, a marine Bacteroidete that can metabolize porphyran derived from marine red algae belonging to the genus Porphyra (Hehemann et al., 2010 ▶). Porphyranases from Z. galactani­vorans were isolated, their biochemical activities were confirmed and the structures of two of them were determined by X-ray crystallography (PDB entries 3juu and 3ilf; Hehemann et al., 2010 ▶). Homologous genes were found in the common human gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius. Intriguingly, these genes were represented in the gut microbiomes of Japanese but not North American individuals. These findings are consistent with a horizontal gene-transfer event whereby porphyranases from an ancestral marine bacterium related to the Bacteroidetes Z. galactanivorans and Microscilla sp. PRE1 were acquired by a resident member of the gut microbiota of Japanese consumers of nonsterile food; this microbiome-acquired trait may have then been disseminated to other members of this human society.Systematic application of high-throughput structural genomics initiatives to CAZymes represented in human microbiomes will undoubtedly yield protein folds together with the expectation that new insights/predictions about their functions will ensue. However, proteins that interact with complex carbohydrates pose some difficult challenges when trying to elucidate function ‘just’ through fold determination. The reason relates at least in part to the fact that these proteins must selectively recognize and process one of the most diverse classes of biological substrates on Earth: substrates that possess an enormous range of stereochemical and structural variations (Laine, 1994 ▶). These variations in turn are harnessed by living organisms to fulfill very different roles: e.g. structural, storage, specific signaling, specific recognition among myriad similar molecules, host–pathogen interactions and exchanges between symbionts to name but a few. Predictions such as ‘putative glycoside hydrolase’ or ‘putative carbohydrate-binding protein’ are still a long way from what is desirable, owing to the different functions that carbohydrates achieve depending on seemingly small structural variations. A vivid example is provided by polymers of d-glucose residues linked between C atoms 1 and 4: if the glycosidic bond is α the polymer is amylose and is used for carbon storage by most cells; if the glycosidic bond is β the polymer is cellulose, one of nature’s toughest structural polysaccharides.Carbohydrate diversity greatly exceeds the number of known protein folds and is undoubtedly one reason for the observed diversity of genes encoding putative CAZymes (Fig. 1 ▶
a). One consequence is that gene families group together enzymes with widely different substrate or product specificities (Henrissat, 1991 ▶). Another consequence is that to derive knowledge useful for subsequent functional predictions, we must adopt a divide-and-conquer approach whereby subgroups (subfamilies, clusters) are defined within families and then functional characterization in each subgroup without a biochemically established member is performed. This process needs refinement, as the appropriate threshold for defining a subfamily is likely to vary from one family to another. For example, there are extreme cases such as blood-group transferases where two amino-acid changes switch the substrate specificity for the transferred carbohydrate from galactose to N-acetylgalactosamine, thereby changing the resulting blood-group epitope from B to A (Seto et al., 1999 ▶). At the other end of the spectrum, cellulases with as little as 10% sequence identity can digest the same substrate (Henrissat et al., 1989 ▶).CAZymes are modular and increasingly described only by high-throughput sequencing data. (a) Growth of sequence, functional and structural data in the CAZy database. (b) Example of modular variation in CAZymes containing a common CBM10 domain.Microbes are particularly ingenious at inventing novel CAZymes, either from other CAZymes or from other ‘pre-existing’ scaffolds; e.g. at least five different folds are known for cellulases (1cec, 1cb2, 1cel, 1clc, 2eng; Dominguez et al., 1995 ▶; Koivula et al., 1996 ▶; Divne et al., 1994 ▶; M. B. Lascombe, H. Souchon, M. Juy & P. M. Alzari, unpublished work; Davies et al., 1995 ▶). CAZymes have a highly variable modular structure, with the catalytic module carrying a variable number of ancillary modules. Each module can provide a complementary catalytic activity or carbohydrate-binding, protein-binding, cell-binding (or other unknown) capabilities. The number of domain combinations is very large and this is one way devised by living organisms to increase the number of carbohydrate-interacting proteins using a limited number of folds. A consequence of this modular variability (Fig. 1 ▶
b) is that the precise function of a module sitting next to a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) is hard to predict since it could be catalytic (e.g. glycoside hydrolase, polysaccharide lyase, carbohydrate esterase, protease or kinase) or noncatalytic (e.g. another CBM, a membrane-attachment domain or a module involved in cell adhesion or in cellulosome assembly). Some carbohydrate-interacting proteins are made of a single CBM, while others may contain two noncatalytic modules (e.g. CBM33-CBM2; expansins). Syntrophy (cross-feeding) between any two organisms can be conceptualized as the proportion of ‘seeds’ (molecules acquired exogenously from the environment; Borenstein et al., 2008 ▶) that are intermediates or end products in another, while competition can be viewed as the number of seeds that are shared. Microbes need to remain in the vicinity of their seeds (substrates) to establish and maintain syntrophic relationships and it is entirely possible that some dual binding proteins exist to bind a carbohydrate on the one hand and some component of a neighbor’s cell surface on the other.One class of CAZymes, the glycosyltransferases (GT), are particularly difficult to study experimentally owing to their frequent association with membranes, their poor stability in pure form and their low solubility (Davies et al., 2005 ▶). Assays for enzymatic function are also difficult because the nucleotide diphospho-sugar donor must be identified along with the acceptor, which could potentially span a wide range of molecules. In addition, GTs may lack great specificity in vitro. This observation can be rationalized by the fact that GTs frequently encounter a narrow set of donor/acceptor molecules by virtue of their compartmentalization within cells or because metabolic fluxes deliver the ‘appropriate’ reagents to these enzymes. Moreover, the few structural studies of GTs reported to date have revealed that they undergo important conformational changes upon ligand binding and that only the ternary complex with both donor and acceptor achieves the conformation suitable for catalysis (Lairson et al., 2008 ▶). While significant success has been achieved by structural genomics initiatives with proteins that bind or break down complex carbohydrates, the number of GT structures remains comparatively modest (Table 1 ▶).Even if a structure is solved for a putative glycoside hydrolase, it can be difficult to infer its function. One way around this problem is to determine whether there are conserved aspartate or glutamate residues that are suitably positioned to perform catalysis (McCarter & Withers, 1994 ▶; Davies & Henrissat, 1995 ▶, 2002 ▶). Although the catalytic residues of GHs are usually strictly conserved, there are examples that serve as a warning against over-interpretation of in silico predictions and as a strong incentive for rigorous experimental characterization (Table 2 ▶). Currently, there are several active collaborative efforts for research and education in the glycosciences both in the USA and Europe; e.g. the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (http://www.functionalglycomics.org/), the Euroglycosciences Forum (http://www.egsf.org/) and the German Glycosciences Initiative (http://www.glycosciences.de/). These resources could be expanded and/or used as starting points for additional efforts aimed at systematic functional characterization of carbohydrate-active enzymes identified by mining the massive data sets emanating from the ever-increasing numbers of metagenomic studies of microbial communities.In summary, for CAZymes, CBMs and other sugar-interacting proteins, perhaps more than for any other protein class, there is an enormous need to join metagenomics together with structural biology initiatives and to link the output with functional assays. In this respect, the remarkable structures of microbiome-encoded proteins that are being solved through structural genomics initiatives represent islands in a sea of insecure predictions. Follow-up biochemical work needs to be performed to identify the actual carbohydrate structures recognized and processed by a given protein whose fold has been characterized. Accelerating the pace of discovery of these carbohydrate structures will require new experimental innovations, as well as the sponsorship of individuals who wish to train in the glycosciences.Work cited from the authors’ laboratories were supported by grants from the NIH (DK78669 and DK30292), the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation of America and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (France)."
PMC2954218,Structure of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron BT2081 at 2.05 Å resolution: the first structural representative of a new protein family that may play a role in carbohydrate metabolism,False,"BT2081 from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (GenBank accession code {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NP_810994.1"",""term_id"":""29347491"",""term_text"":""NP_810994.1""}}NP_810994.1) is a member of a novel protein family consisting of over 160 members, most of which are found in the different classes of Bacteroidetes. Genome-context analysis lends support to the involvement of this family in carbohydrate metabolism, which plays a key role in B. thetaiotaomicron as a predominant bacterial symbiont in the human distal gut microbiome. The crystal structure of BT2081 at 2.05 Å resolution represents the first structure from this new protein family. BT2081 consists of an N-terminal domain, which adopts a β-sandwich immunoglobulin-like fold, and a larger C-terminal domain with a β-sandwich jelly-roll fold. Structural analyses reveal that both domains are similar to those found in various carbohydrate-active enzymes. The C-terminal β-jelly-roll domain contains a potential carbohydrate-binding site that is highly conserved among BT2081 homologs and is situated in the same location as the carbohydrate-binding sites that are found in structurally similar glycoside hydrolases (GHs). However, in BT2081 this site is partially occluded by surrounding loops, which results in a deep solvent-accessible pocket rather than a shallower solvent-exposed cleft.
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that is a dominant member of the human intestinal tract microbiome. This bacterial species is essential for the metabolism and uptake of dietary plant polysaccharides by the human host (Comstock & Coyne, 2003 ▶; Xu et al., 2003 ▶; Zocco et al., 2007 ▶). To utilize these polysaccharides, B. thetaiotaomicron expresses a large number of carbohydrate-processing enzymes. Indeed, it is estimated that ∼6.6% of the B. thetaiotaomicron genome encodes such proteins, many of which are novel and have not been functionally or structurally characterized (Davies et al., 2005 ▶).The BT2081 gene product of B. thetaiotaomicron encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 37 198 Da (residues 1–341) and a calculated isoelectric point of 4.9. It contains a predicted N-terminal signalling peptide, suggesting that it is secreted from the cytoplasm. Sequence and genomic context analysis suggest that it is a putative carbohydrate-processing protein that is part of the extracellular polysaccharide-processing machinery. Its N-terminal region (residues 1–114) shares high sequence similarity to the carbohydrate-binding domains of endo-1,4-β-xylanase from Streptomyces griseoflavus (35% sequence identity), β-xylosidase from Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum (29% sequence identity) and a putative β-fructosidase from Sarcoptes scabiei (39% sequence identity), all of which are glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which catalyze the cleavage of the glycosidic bonds in monosaccharide, disaccharides and polysaccharides into their constituent sugar units. Moreover, genome-context analysis shows that BT2081 and several of its paralogs belong to characteristic PULs (polysaccharide-utilization loci) of B. thetaiotaomicron and are associated with transmembrane porin domains that are homologous to the B. thetaiotaomicron outer membrane protein transporter SusC. SusC is part of the well characterized eight-component sus (starch-utilization system) operon used by B. thetaiotaomicron in carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, in the sus operon two other BT2081 paralogs (BT0450 and BT1761) are immediately followed by GHs. To further investigate the role that BT2081 may play in carbohydrate metabolism, we have determined its crystal structure using the semi-automated high-throughput pipeline of the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG; Lesley et al., 2002 ▶) as part of the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIH.Clones were generated using the Polymerase Incomplete Primer Extension (PIPE) cloning method (Klock et al., 2008 ▶). The gene encoding BT2081 (GenBank {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NP_810994"",""term_id"":""29347491"",""term_text"":""NP_810994""}}NP_810994, Swiss-Prot {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q8A605"",""term_id"":""81444355"",""term_text"":""Q8A605""}}Q8A605) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from B. thetaiota­omicron VPI-5482 genomic DNA using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and I-PIPE (Insert) primers (forward primer, 5′-ctgtacttccagggcCGCGAAGAAGCTCCCAATGCAGAGGCAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-aattaagtcgcgttaGTCTTCCGAGCGATAGATT­AGTTCGACT-3′; target sequences in upper case) that included sequences for the predicted 5′ and 3′ ends. The expression vector pSpeedET, which encodes an amino-terminal tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavable expression and purification tag (MGSDK­IHHHHHHENLYFQ/G), was PCR-amplified with V-PIPE (Vector) primers (forward primer, 5′-taacgcgacttaattaactcgtttaaacgg­tctccagc-3′; reverse primer, 5′-gccctggaagtacaggttttcgtgatgatgatgatg­atg-3′). V-PIPE and I-PIPE PCR products were mixed to anneal the amplified DNA fragments together. Escherichia coli GeneHogs (Invitrogen) com­petent cells were transformed with the I-PIPE/V-­PIPE mixture and dispensed onto selective LB–agar plates. The cloning junctions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Using the PIPE method, the gene segment encoding Met1–Ile20 was deleted because it was predicted to be a signal peptide. Expression was performed in selenomethionine-containing medium at 310 K with suppression of normal methionine synthesis. At the end of fermentation, lysozyme was added to the culture to a final concentration of 250 µg ml−1 and the cells were harvested and frozen. After one freeze–thaw cycle, the cells were sonicated in lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine–HCl (TCEP)] and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 32 500g for 30 min. The soluble fraction was passed over nickel-chelating resin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer, the resin was washed with wash buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 10%(v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP] and the protein was eluted with elution buffer [20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300 mM imidazole, 10%(v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP]. The eluate was buffer-exchanged with TEV buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 1 mM TCEP) using a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) and incubated with 1 mg TEV protease per 15 mg eluted protein. The protease-treated eluate was passed over nickel-chelating resin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with HEPES crystallization buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 1 mM TCEP) and the resin was washed with the same buffer. The flowthrough and wash fractions were combined and concentrated to 13.5 mg ml−1 by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Millipore) for crystallization trials. BT2081 was crystallized by mixing 100 nl protein solution with 100 nl crystallization solution in a sitting drop over a 50 µl reservoir volume using the nanodroplet vapor-diffusion method (Santarsiero et al., 2002 ▶) with standard JCSG crystallization protocols (Lesley et al., 2002 ▶). The crystallization reagent consisted of 42%(v/v) polyethylene glycol 600, 0.25 M calcium acetate and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.33. PEG 400 was added to the crystal as a cryoprotectant to a final concentration of 5%(v/v). A triangular prism-shaped crystal of approximately 200 × 200 × 200 µm in size was harvested after 43 d at 277 K for data collection. Initial screening for diffraction was carried out using the Stanford Automated Mounting system (SAM; Cohen et al., 2002 ▶) at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL, Menlo Park, California, USA). The diffraction data were indexed in the trigonal space group P3221. The oligomeric state of BT2081 in solution was determined using a 1 × 30 cm Superdex 200 size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare). The mobile phase consisted of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.02%(w/v) sodium azide. The molecular weight was calculated using ASTRA v.5.1.5 software (Wyatt Technology). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus assay (Pierce).Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data were collected on beamline 11-1 at the SSRL at a wavelength corresponding to the peak (λ1) of a selenium SAD experiment. The data set was collected at 100 K using a MAR Mosaic 325 mm CCD detector (Rayonix) using the Blu-Ice data-collection environment (McPhillips et al., 2002 ▶). The SAD data were integrated and reduced using MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992 ▶) and then scaled with the program SCALA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994 ▶). Phasing was performed with SHELXD (Sheldrick, 2008 ▶) and autoSHARP [mean figure-of-merit (acentric/centric) of 0.28/0.09 with 11 anomalous scatterers per asymmetric unit (eight SeMet, two cacodylate ions and one calcium ion); Vonrhein et al., 2007 ▶]. Automatic model building was performed with ARP/wARP (Cohen et al., 2004 ▶). Model completion was performed with Coot (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004 ▶) and TLS refinement with REFMAC5 (Winn et al., 2003 ▶). The refinement included experimental phase restraints in the form of Hendrickson–Lattman coefficients and two TLS groups per chain, with the TLS groups being assigned with the aid of the TLSMD server (Painter & Merritt, 2006 ▶). Data-collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 ▶. X-ray fluorescence emission peaks for selenium, arsenic, nickel and calcium were observed when the crystal was scanned on SSRL beamline 1-5 with X-rays above (500 eV) the Se K edge. Calcium was assigned based on binding geometry and its presence in the crystallization conditions. Additional diffraction data were collected above and below the arsenic and nickel edges, with the resultant anomalous electron-density maps revealing the presence of arsenic in the form of cacodylate (which was present in the crystallization condition) and the absence of nickel.Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.The quality of the crystal structure was analyzed using the JCSG Quality Control server (http://smb.slac.stanford.edu/jcsg/QC). This server processes the coordinates and data through a variety of validation tools including AutoDepInputTool (Yang et al., 2004 ▶), MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010 ▶), WHAT IF v.5.0 (Vriend, 1990 ▶), RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2004 ▶), MOLEMAN2 (Kleywegt, 2000 ▶) as well as several in-house scripts and summarizes the results. Protein quaternary-structure analysis used the PISA server (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007 ▶). Fig. 1 ▶(b) was adapted from PDBsum (Laskowski, 2009 ▶) and all other figures were prepared with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors for BT2081 from B. thetaiotaomicron at 2.05 Å resolution were deposited in the PDB (http://www.pdb.org) under code 3hbz.Crystal structure of BT2081 from B. thetaiotaomicron. (a) Ribbon diagram of the BT2081 monomer, showing the distinct N-terminal (green) and C-terminal (purple) domains. Helices (H1–H7) and β-strands (β1–β28) are indicated. (b) Diagram showing the secondary-structure elements of BT2081 superimposed on its primary sequence. The labeling of secondary-structure elements [colored by domain as in (a)] is in accord with PDBsum (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbsum), in which α-helices (H1, H3, H5 and H6), 310-­helices (H2, H4 and H7) and β-strands (β1–β28) are labeled sequentially, β-turns and γ-turns are designated by Greek letters (β, γ) and β-hairpins by red loops.The crystal structure of BT2081 (Fig. 1 ▶) was determined to 2.05 Å resolution using the SAD method. Data-collection, model and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 ▶. The final model includes one BT2081 molecule (residues 21–360), two calcium ions, two sodium ions, two cacodylate anions, two acetate anions, 19 polyethylene glycol molecules and 251 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Gly0, which is part of the expression construct and remained after cleavage of the N-terminal purification tag, is also part of the final model. The nucleotide sequence corresponding to residues 1–20 was omitted from the expression construct as this region was predicted to encode either a lipoprotein signal peptide or, more likely, a single transmembrane helix anchoring BT2081 in the outer membrane of the cell. Electron density was not observed for the C-­terminal Asp361 or for some of the side-chain atoms of Arg21, Glu23, Glu139, Lys239, Lys249, Glu299, Lys317 and Glu318. The Matthews coefficient (V
M; Matthews, 1968 ▶) for BT2081 is 3.69 Å3 Da−1 and the estimated solvent content is 67%. The Ramachandran plot produced by MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010 ▶) shows that 97.9% and 99.7% of the residues are in the favored and allowed regions, respectively. The single residue in the disallowed region, Ala27, is in a section of poorly defined electron density.BT2081 is composed of 28 β-strands (β1–β28), four α-helices (H1, H3, H5 and H6) and three 310-helices (H2, H4 and H7) (Fig. 1 ▶). The total β-sheet, α-helical and 310-helical content is 39.0, 6.2 and 2.6%, respectively. Crystallographic packing, as well as PISA analyses (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007 ▶) of BT2081, suggest that a monomer is likely to be the biologically relevant form of the protein, which is consistent with results from analytical size-exclusion chromatography (anSEC).The BT2081 monomer consists of two structural domains (Fig. 1 ▶). The N-terminal domain (residues 21–114) adopts a β-sandwich fold consisting of two-stranded (β1 and β4) and five-stranded (β2, β3 and β5–β7) β-sheets, which concurs with its classification into the immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold superfamily of SCOP (Andreeva et al., 2004 ▶). The C-terminal domain (residues 115–361) also adopts a β-­sandwich fold, the core of which comprises two five-stranded antiparallel β-sheets that form a concave (β15/β18, β22, β23, β25 and β26) and a convex (β8/β12, β11, β19, β24 and β28) surface. This domain adopts a β-jelly-roll topology, consistent with its assignment to the galactose-binding domain-like superfamily of SCOP.Carbohydrate-active enzymes are quite modular, often containing various carbohydrate-binding and catalytic domains in different combinations. Glycoside hydrolases (GHs), for example, often con­tain both catalytic and noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) which can be assembled in different orders (Davies et al., 2005 ▶; Henrissat & Davies, 1997 ▶; Cantarel et al., 2009 ▶). CBMs, which can bind a range of different polysaccharides, function to increase the catalytic efficiency of GHs by bringing the catalytic module into closer proximity with its substrate (Bolam et al., 1998 ▶; Tomme et al., 1995 ▶).The Ig-like and jelly-roll domains of BT2081 have previously been observed as modules in carbohydrate-active enzymes. CtCel9D-Cel44A, a multi-enzyme GH complex from Clostridium thermocellum, for example, contains polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and CBM family 44 (CBM44) domains (PDB code 2c26; Najmudin et al., 2006 ▶) that also adopt Ig-like and β-jelly-roll folds, respectively. However, the relative orientation of the two domains differs significantly and as a result the superposition of these two structures using FATCAT (http://fatcat.burnham.org; Ye & Godzik, 2004 ▶) required two rotations or twists around the linker region that connects the two domains in order to obtain optimal alignment of the full-length structures. When BT2081 and PKD-CBM44 are structurally aligned in this way, the r.m.s.d. between 202 Cα atoms is 3.15 Å despite only 6.7% sequence identity (Fig. 2 ▶). An important distinction between these two proteins, which highlights the modularity of carbohydrate-active enzymes, is that, in addition to the PKD and CBM44 domains, CtCel9D-Cel44A contains additional domains (Ig-like, CBM30, GH9 and GH44) that are absent from BT2081.Structural comparison of BT2081 with PKD-CBM44 of C. thermocellum CtCel9D-Cel44A. Superposition of BT2081 (orange/yellow) with PKD-CBM44 (lilac/pale blue; PDB code 2c26), which also contain both the Ig-like and β-jelly-roll domains. Calcium ions are represented as spheres. Protein regions which were used for alignment by FATCAT are shown in darker shades (orange for BT2081 and lilac for PKD-CBM44) to highlight similarities in the protein cores. Please note that two twists have been introduced by FATCAT into the structure of PKD-CBM44 in order to obtain optimal full-length alignments of the structures.Similarly, some bacterial sialidases also contain both Ig-like and β-­jelly-roll domains. NedA, a sialidase from Micromonospora viridi­faciens (PDB code 1euu; Gaskell et al., 1995 ▶), contains these two domains, but also has a third GH family 33 (GH33) catalytic domain at its N-terminus that adopts a six-bladed β-propeller fold. The C-­terminal β-jelly-roll domain of NedA belongs to CBM family 32 (CBM32), while the middle Ig-like domain is thought to act as a linker region between the CBM32 and GH33 domains. Similar to CtCel9D-Cel44A, the relative orientation of the Ig-like and β-jelly-roll domains differs significantly between BT2081 and NedA and, as a result, four consecutive twists in the region between these domains were required to obtain an optimal full-length alignment of the structures by FATCAT. The resultant r.m.s.d. between 184 Cα atoms, which share only 4.8% sequence identity, is 3.11 Å.A structural similarity search of the N-terminal domain of BT2081 only performed using the FATCAT server, revealed many proteins that belong to the Ig-like fold family. The closest match was to the soluble upper-middle domain (UMD; residues 232–320) of the outer membrane protein usher from Yersinia pestis (PDB code 3fcg; Yu et al., 2009 ▶), with an r.m.s.d. of 2.65 Å between 49 Cα atoms and a sequence identity of 7.6%. The second and third closest structural neighbors were SoxY from Paracoccus pantotrophus (PDB code 2oxg; Sauve et al., 2007 ▶), with an r.m.s.d. of 3.08 Å between 64 Cα atoms and a sequence identity of 5.6%, and the I-set domain (residues 3537–3630) of human obscurin (PDB code 2edw; R. Sano, F. Hayashi, M. Yoshida & S. Yokoyama, unpublished work), with an r.m.s.d. of 3.07 Å between 59 Cα atoms and a sequence identity of 2.5%. Although none of the top structural neighbors from this search matched carbohydrate-active enzymes, the Ig-like fold has been observed in a number of these proteins. In addition to CtCel9D-Cel44A and NedA, structures from CBM families 9, 20, 25, 26, 31, 33 and 34 have also been found to adopt Ig-like folds (Hashimoto, 2006 ▶). Despite their structural similarity, the BT2081 N-terminal domain shares little sequence similarity with these CBMs (see Table 2 ▶
a for superposition statistics). Superposition of the BT2081 N-terminal domain with CBM families that adopt Ig-like folds. Representative closest structural neighbors of the BT2081 C-terminal domain.Sequence analysis of the BT2081 N-terminal domain with BLAST revealed significant sequence similarity to portions of several GHs, including endo-1,4-β-xylanase from St. griseoflavus (35% sequence identity over 90 residues), β-xylosidase from M. magnetotacticum (29% sequence identity over 94 residues) and a putative β-fructo­sidase from Sa. scabiei (39% sequence identity over 76 residues). In all of these sequences, the putative Ig-like domain immediately precedes a putative GH43 catalytic domain, which is known to adopt a fivefold β-propeller fold. The role of the putative Ig-like domain in these GHs is still currently unknown.A calcium ion is present in the N-terminal domain on the surface near the start of the domain (Fig. 3 ▶). This calcium is octahedrally coordinated by two waters, a cacodylate ion, the carbonyl O atom of Lys103, the carboxylate group of Glu28 and the carboxylate group of Asp162 from a crystallographically related molecule. The role of this calcium (if any) is unclear. CBM9 from Thermotoga maritima xylan­ase 10A (PDB code 1i82; Notenboom et al., 2001 ▶) and the PKD domain of CtCel9D-Cel44A (PDB code 2c26; Najmudin et al., 2006 ▶) also contain calcium(s); however, the location of the calcium-binding site is different from that in BT2081. It has been postulated that these calcium ions may play a structural role given the nature of the buried binding sites (Najmudin et al., 2006 ▶; Notenboom et al., 2001 ▶). Unlike those proteins, however, the calcium in the BT2081 N-terminal domain is quite solvent-exposed and, as three of the six ligands are solvent molecules and another is a crystallographically related molecule, this bound calcium ion is most likely to be an artifact of crystallization.Molecular surface of the BT2081 N-terminal domain colored according to residue conservation by ConSurf (http://consurf.tau.ac.il; Landau et al., 2005 ▶). The most conserved residues are shown in magenta, the least conserved residues are shown in cyan and those with insufficient data to determine the conservation level are shown in yellow. The molecular surface of the C-terminal domain is shown in gray. (a) and (b) are views of opposite surfaces of the N-terminal domain, showing that residue conservation is predominantly on one side. The calcium ion in (b) is represented as a green sphere.Analysis of BT2081 and its homologs reveals a highly conserved region of the N-terminal domain that may be functionally important. These conserved residues include Glu23, Ala24, Asn26, Glu28 and Ile31 situated between the N-terminus and β-strand 1, as well as residues from two adjacent regions: Phe69, Gly74, Ala75 and Ile77 between β-strands 4 and 5, and Val95, Thr96, Asp99 and Trp102 between β-strands 6 and 7. Together, these residues form a highly conserved patch on one surface of the N-terminal domain, in contrast to the minimal conservation that is observed on the opposite surface (Fig. 3 ▶).In light of the fact that Ig-like domains in GHs are sometimes CBMs, one possibility is that the N-terminal domain of BT2081 may also be a CBM and, as such, the highly conserved region may be a carbohydrate-binding site. Another possible role for the BT2081 N-­terminal domain is as a linker region, similar to the Ig-like domain in NedA. BT2081 is predicted to contain a signal sequence at the N-­terminus, which, based on its predominantly hydrophobic amino-acid composition, may correspond to a single transmembrane helix that anchors BT2081 to the bacterial outer membrane. If this is indeed the case, the N-terminal domain may act as a linker region between the membrane surface and the C-terminal domain.Analysis with FATCAT indicates that most of the top structural neighbors of the BT2081 C-terminal domain are either catalytic modules or CBMs of GHs. Representative examples of these structural neighbors are the catalytic module of a Bacillus 1,3–1,4-β-glucanase (PDB code 1byh; Keitel et al., 1993 ▶) and the CBMs from CBM families 6, 11, 16 and 29, which include C. thermocellum xylan­ase 11A (PDB code 1gmm; Czjzek et al., 2001 ▶), C. thermocellum Lic26A-Cel5E endoglucanase (PDB code 1v0a; Carvalho et al., 2004 ▶), Thermoanaerobacterium polysaccharolyticum mannanase (PDB code 2zew; Bae et al., 2008 ▶) and Piromyces equi cellulose/hemicellulase complex (PDB code 1gwk; Charnock et al., 2002 ▶), respectively (see Table 2 ▶
b).Despite the low sequence identity between the C-terminal domain of BT2081 and its top structural neighbors, they share the same core β-jelly-roll topology (Fig. 4 ▶). Another shared feature is a conserved calcium-binding site on the convex surface of the β-jelly roll (Fig. 5 ▶). The role of this conserved calcium is most likely to be structural, as it has previously been shown in the case of CBM4 to contribute greater stability to the protein fold (Abou-Hachem et al., 2002 ▶). In BT2081, this calcium is octahedrally coordinated by a water molecule, the carbonyl O atoms of Asn120, Thr174 and Lys176 and the carboxylate O atoms of Glu122 and Asp351. Of this cluster, Glu122 and Asp351 are strictly conserved, Lys176 is highly conserved and Asn120 and Thr174 are poorly conserved among BT2081 sequence homologs, although the latter three would not necessarily be expected to be conserved in amino-acid type as they only make main-chain contacts to the calcium. Several of the immediate neighboring residues (e.g. Phe133, Trp145, Lys237, Trp300 and Phe331) are also highly con­served. Comparison of this site in BT2081 and its structural neighbors reveals that it is most similar, in terms of residue conservation, to the corresponding sites in members from the CBM11 (PDB code 1v0a) and CBM16 (PDB code 2zew) families.Superposition of the BT2081 C-terminal domain (yellow) with two representative top structural neighbors as assessed by FATCAT: the catalytic module of a Bacillus 1,3–1,4-β-glucanase (red; PDB code 1byh) and CBM29 of a mannanase from T. polysaccharolyticum (green; PDB code 2zew).

Distances between the calcium ion and its ligands are indicated in Å.The C-terminal domain of BT2081 contains extended solvent-exposed loop regions (Glu144–Pro165, Thr182–Gly199, Ile203–Ile228, Ala240–Cys258, Thr267–Asn284, Phe307–Lys324 and Ser333–Ser346) that are not found in its closest structural neighbors. Several of these loops also contain additional secondary-structural elements including β-strands, α-helices and 310-helices. As a consequence of these extended loop regions, a significant distinction between BT2081 and its structural counterparts is the presence of a deep solvent-accessible pocket in BT2081 formed by highly conserved residues from the concave surface of the β-jelly-roll core and five of the loop regions extending from this core. The concave surface of the β-jelly-roll core forms the base of this pocket, with loop 1 (residues 144–165) forming the pocket terminus, loop 2 (residues 182–199) and loop 3 (residues 203–228) comprising the middle section of the pocket, and loop 4 (residues 267–284) and loop 5 (residues 333–346) forming the side walls near the pocket entrance.The pocket is lined with a combination of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues (aliphatic, Gly148, Gly151, Pro165, Gly189, Met194, Ile196, Ala197, Ala198, Ala211, Met212, Pro215, Leu216, Ala218, Gly276, Ala279, Val330, Leu335 and Gly337; aromatic, Tyr152, Phe202, Phe206, Phe221, Tyr261, Phe280 and Phe340; hydrophilic, Asn149, Thr155, Thr166, Thr185, Asn200, Thr219, Asp259, Thr281, Arg290, Thr332, Ser334, Glu336, Asp338 and His339; Fig. 6 ▶), most of which are highly conserved among BT2081 and its top 20 PSI-BLAST-derived sequence homologs, lending support to this pocket being functionally significant.Putative carbohydrate-binding pocket as seen from above the concave surface of the jelly-roll fold. An arrow indicates the pocket entrance. The residues that line the pocket are highlighted in stick representation and are color-coded according to type as follows: aromatic, green; hydrophobic, light green; polar, lilac; acidic, red; basic, blue.The pocket, which has a volume of ∼1160 Å3 as calculated by PDBsum (Laskowski, 2009 ▶), has a slight kink near its entrance and measures ∼4 Å from the entrance to this bend and ∼19 Å from there to the bottom of the pocket. The width varies along the length of the pocket, ranging from ∼10 Å at the entrance to ∼7.5 Å at the narrowest portion at the bend and widening to ∼13.5 Å near the pocket terminus (Fig. 7 ▶).Cutaway side view of the putative carbohydrate-binding pocket highlighting the nature of the residues lining the pocket, including several that may play a role in catalysis. The color scheme of the residues is the same as in Fig. 6 ▶.Several features of this pocket suggest that it may be a carbo­hydrate-binding site. First, it is located in a similar location to the carbohydrate-binding sites of structurally similar GH catalytic modules and CBMs. In CBMs that can be classified as ‘glycan-chain-binding’ or type B CBMs (Boraston et al., 2004 ▶), the carbohydrate-binding site is a cleft that extends along the concave surface of the β-­jelly-roll fold. These clefts consist of several subsites to which individual sugar moieties of a polysaccharide chain can bind. The topography of the cleft is defined in a large part by several aromatic residues, which are key determinants of polysaccharide binding specificity. Second, hydrogen bonding between the polysaccharide and polar residues in the binding site is also important for binding affinity in these CBMs (Boraston et al., 2004 ▶).Similar to the carbohydrate-binding sites found in type B CBMs, the putative binding pocket of BT2081 contains several highly con­served aromatic residues arranged in such a way that they form a twisted platform to which a potential polysaccharide could bind. These aromatic residues include Phe202, Phe206, Phe221, Tyr261, Phe280 and Phe340, of which Phe202, Phe206, Tyr261 and Phe340 are strictly conserved among sequence homologs. Moreover, the BT2081 pocket contains a number of polar residues (e.g. Asn149, Thr155, Thr166, Thr185, Asn200, Thr219 and Thr332) whose side chains are positioned for potential hydrogen bonding with a bound polysaccharide, in another characteristic feature which helps to define carbohydrate-binding specificity in type B CBMs.The evidence from genomic context analysis and the similarity of the fold and putative binding pocket of BT2081 to those of CBMs and catalytic modules of GHs strongly suggest that the pocket in BT2081 may be a carbohydrate-binding site. If so, the next question is whether the C-terminal domain of BT2081 displays GH enzymatic activity or whether it acts instead as a noncatalytic CBM.The hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds by GHs usually occurs via general acid catalysis involving two GH carboxylate residues that act as a proton donor and a nucleophile/base (Koshland, 1953 ▶; Sinnott, 1990 ▶). Hydrolysis can occur via two canonical mechanisms, which result in either the inversion or retention of the configuration of the anomeric carbon that undergoes nucleophilic attack.In Bacillus 1,3–1,4-β-glucanase (PDB code 1byh), a member of GH family 16 (GHF16) and one of the top structural neighbors of the BT2081 C-terminal domain, Glu105 and Glu109 act as the nucleophile and acid/base in a retaining mechanism for the glycosidic bond cleavage (Keitel et al., 1993 ▶). A comparison with the BT2081 pocket reveals that BT2081 lacks these two catalytic glutamate residues at the corresponding locations. However, several other charged residues line the pocket, including Asp259, Arg290, Glu336 and Asp338, all of which are near each another at the pocket entrance (Figs. 5 ▶, 6 ▶ and 7 ▶). Of these residues, Asp259 and Asp338 at the bend of the pocket are particularly interesting candidates for performing catalytic roles because they are positioned opposite each other in the pocket, with their carboxylate O atoms being sufficiently far apart (∼7.5 Å) to accommodate a carbohydrate substrate. The feasibility of Asp259 as a potential catalytic residue in a hydrolysis reaction may further be supported by its interaction with the neighboring Arg290, which would be expected to reduce the pK
a of Asp259 and thereby prime it for a role as a nucleophile in a retaining mechanism (Fig. 7 ▶).Among the top 20 BT2081 homologs derived from PSI-BLAST Asp259 is almost absolutely conserved (19/20 = 95%), while Asp338 (12/20 = 60%) is less so (Fig. 8 ▶). In the eight sequences in which the position equivalent to Asp338 is not an aspartate, seven have an alanine and one has a glycine. The lack of strict conservation at these sites, particularly Asp338, may raise doubts as to the functional role of these residues; however, such an apparent lack of conservation among active-site residues is not unprecedented. In GH family 97 (GH97), for example, its members have evolutionarily diverged into two main subfamilies which differ in their catalytic mechanism, so that the members of one subfamily are retaining GHs while the members of the other are inverting GHs. In addition to these two main subfamilies, six outlier sequences in the GH97 family were found which lacked key catalytic residues, indicating that these members may be inactive or have evolved a different catalytic mechanism (Gloster et al., 2008 ▶). It is feasible that a similar evolutionary divergence may also have occurred in the BT2081 protein family.Sequence alignment between BT2081 and its top 20 PSI-BLAST homologs (the alignment  is only shown for residues 255–361 of BT2081 for clarity). Residues in white characters on a red background are strictly conserved, while those in red characters with a white background are highly conserved. Red arrows indicate the two residues of BT2081 (Asp259 and Asp338) which may play a role in catalysis. Sequences with aspartates at these positions are highlighted in yellow.The fact that the putative carbohydrate-binding site in BT2081 is a pocket rather than a tunnel or a cleft, as seen in other carbohydrate-active enzymes, suggests that BT2081, if it were indeed a GH, would be likely to be classified as an ‘exo’ GH (i.e. it would cleave the polysaccharide chain at its ends rather than in the middle) and in this regard would be similar to other exopolysaccharidases, such as glucoamylase and β-amylase (Davies & Henrissat, 1995 ▶).Manual docking of various polysaccharides (e.g. cellopentaose, mannopentaose and cellohexaose) into the BT2081 pocket reveals that the pocket can accommodate a polysaccharide as large as a pentaose, with three of the sugar units fitting into the section of the pocket extending from the bend to the pocket terminus and the other two sugar units fitting into the portion that extends from the bend to the pocket entrance. Consequently, if BT2081 were indeed proven to be a GH with Asp259 and Asp338 being the catalytic residues, it would be feasible that up to three terminal sugar units of a bound polysaccharide chain could be cleaved off at one time.BT2081 is the first structural representative of a new protein family which is likely to play a role in carbohydrate metabolism in the distal human gut based on structural and genomic context analyses. BT2081 contains Ig-like and jelly-roll domains, which have been observed to be modules in carbohydrate-active enzymes, such as GHs. The N-­terminal Ig-like domain may act as a CBM and/or a linker region between the outer membrane and the C-terminal domain. The C-­terminal domain contains a pocket that is similar in many respects to carbohydrate-binding sites in CBMs and catalytic modules of GHs. This domain may be catalytic, with Asp259 and Asp338 acting as the catalytic residues in glycosidic bond cleavage. Further biochemical investigation of BT2081 is needed to ascertain whether this is indeed the case.Additional information about BT2081 is available from TOPSAN (Krishna et al., 2010 ▶) at http://www.topsan.org/explore?PDBid=3hbz.PDB reference: putative glycoside hydrolase, 3hbz

PMC2955110,Multiple lateral gene transfers and duplications have promoted plant parasitism ability in nematodes,False,"Author contributions: E.G.J.D. and J.d.A.-E. designed research; E.G.J.D. and P.V. performed research; P.M.C. and B.H. contributed new reagents/analytic tools; E.G.J.D., M.-N.R., J.d.A.-E., and P.A. analyzed data; and E.G.J.D., M.-N.R., and B.H. wrote the paper.Lateral gene transfer from prokaryotes to animals is poorly understood, and the scarce documented examples generally concern genes of uncharacterized role in the receiver organism. In contrast, in plant-parasitic nematodes, several genes, usually not found in animals and similar to bacterial homologs, play essential roles for successful parasitism. Many of these encode plant cell wall-degrading enzymes that constitute an unprecedented arsenal in animals in terms of both abundance and diversity. Here we report that independent lateral gene transfers from different bacteria, followed by gene duplications and early gain of introns, have shaped this repertoire. We also show protein immunolocalization data that suggest additional roles for some of these cell wall-degrading enzymes in the late stages of these parasites’ life cycle. Multiple functional acquisitions of exogenous genes that provide selective advantage were probably crucial for the emergence and proficiency of plant parasitism in nematodes.Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is the transmission of genes between organisms by mechanisms other than vertical inheritance from an ancestor to an offspring. Although largely documented as an important evolutionary mechanism in prokaryotes (1), LGT in animals that have a separate germline and whose genome is segregated in a nucleus is poorly explored. Although some examples have been described (2–4), most concern transfers from endosymbiotic bacteria, and none provide a clear link between the activity of the transferred gene products and the biology of the host species. Thus, arguments are lacking to support a selective advantage that would have driven fixation of transferred genes at the level of a population or species. By contrast, in plant-parasitic nematodes, a series of genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading or -modifying enzymes, which are usually absent from animals, exhibit similarity to bacteria and may thus originate from LGT. These genes are transcriptionally active, their products have been biochemically characterized, they are secreted in plant tissues, and their inactivation impairs parasitism efficiency (5). The most damaging nematodes to agriculture worldwide belong to the suborder Tylenchina in clade IV that comprises root-knot nematodes and cyst nematodes, the two most-studied lineages (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). These nematodes are able to penetrate and migrate into plant tissue and establish sophisticated parasitic interactions with their hosts. Invasion of the root tissues by nematodes requires degradation of the plant cell wall protective barrier, constituted mainly of cellulose and hemicelluloses as well as pectin and its branched decorations. The first plant cell wall-degrading enzymes from an animal were characterized in cyst nematodes in 1998 (6). Ten years later, analysis of the genome of Meloidogyne incognita, the first genome analysis for a plant-parasitic nematode, revealed that the repertoire of cell wall-degrading enzymes in a single species is diverse and abundant with more than 60 genes covering six different protein families for the degradation of cell wall oligo- and polysaccharides (7). This unprecedented repertoire in an animal includes cellulases and xylanases for the degradation of cellulose and hemicelluloses as well as polygalacturonases, pectate lyases, and candidate arabinanases for the degradation of pectins. A set of expansin-like proteins that soften the plant cell wall completes this repertoire (Table 1). Here, we have systematically investigated the evolutionary history and traced back the origin of each family of cell wall-degrading or modifying proteins in plant-parasitic nematodes. We show that these proteins most likely originate from multiple independent LGT events of different bacterial sources. Cellulases, pectate lyases, and expansin-like proteins are encoded by multigenic families, and we show that massive gene duplications after acquisition via LGT account for their abundance.Plant cell wall-modifying proteins in plant-parasitic nematodesSpectrum of the presence in nematodes is indicated according to the taxonomy in SI Appendix, Fig. S1. Species possessing the genes most closely related to those of plant-parasitic nematodes are in the last column.

Polygalacturonase activity is known in the glycoside hydrolase GH28 family, frequently found in bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and plants (www.cazy.org; ref. 8). Although generally absent from animals, this enzyme has been characterized in two phytophagous insects: Sitophilus oryzae (9), for which an acquisition via LGT from fungi has been proposed (10), and Phaedon cochleariae, in which the enzyme may be encoded by a gut digestive symbiont (11). In nematodes, polygalacturonase activity has been suspected in Ditylenchus dipsaci since the 1970s (12), and GH28 enzymes have been isolated and biochemically characterized in M. incognita (13). We identified polygalacturonase genes only in root-knot nematodes. Our phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2) shows that these nematode GH28 enzymes form a highly supported group with a series of bacterial orthologs. A cluster of GH28 enzymes from the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum is positioned in the middle of root-knot nematode GH28 enzymes. Interestingly, R. solanacearum is a plant-pathogenic soil bacterium that shares plant hosts with root-knot nematodes. Our tree topology suggests that at least one LGT event occurred between bacteria that are probably closely related to Ralstonia and these nematodes. Possibly, a second LGT occurred with a different bacterial donor species. As an outgroup to the root-knot nematodes/Ralstonia cluster, we observed a series of other bacteria. The closest relatives in eukaryotes are from plants but are much more distant. Homologs from fungi and oomycetes and from the two reported insects were too distantly related to be included in a phylogenetic analysis, suggesting distinct origins.Phylogenetic trees of pectin-modifying proteins.

RKN, root-knot nematode; CN, cyst nematode. Dashed lines delineate phylogenetic groupings of bacterial and plant-parasitic nematode genes; the corresponding PP value is circled.In contrast to polygalacturonases, pectate lyases cleave α-1,4-galacturonan, the major component of pectin backbone, via β-elimination instead of hydrolysis. All pectate lyases characterized in plant-parasitic nematodes belong to polysaccharide lyase (PL) family 3. In root-knot nematodes, PL3s are present as multigenic families in both M. incognita and Meloidogyne hapla (7, 14). Functional PL3’s have also been isolated in cyst nematodes (15, 16) and in Aphelenchoidea. Nematodes that belong to this last group are plant-associated and hold an outgroup position relative to root-knot and cyst nematodes (17, 18) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Our phylogenetic reconstructions with homologs from nematodes, bacteria, oomycetes, and fungi provided strong support for separation of PL3’s in two main clusters: one cluster grouping bacteria and nematodes and another cluster containing fungi and oomycetes (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Inside the bacteria/nematode cluster, nematode PL3’s are interspersed by two clusters of Actinobacteria. To gain a deeper insight into the bacteria/nematode cluster, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using only bacterial and nematode PL3’s because they form a distinct monophyletic group. This tree (Fig. 1B) revealed evolutionary relations between the different plant-parasitic nematodes and bacterial clusters. Remarkably, Clavibacter michiganensis, the bacterium that possesses PL3’s most closely related to the majority of those of root-knot and cyst nematodes, is a notorious plant parasite that shares host plants with these nematodes. This group of plant-parasitic nematodes may have acquired PL3’s from an ancestor or a close relative of this bacterium. The non-monophyly of root-knot and cyst nematode PL3’s suggests that a few independent LGT events gave rise to the different subfamilies. These distinct root-knot and cyst nematode clusters show that, in both lineages, a series of duplications followed the likely acquisition of ancestral PL3’s via LGT and account for the abundance of this family.Arabinans and arabinogalactans are the main components of pectin side chains. These chains can prevent access to the pectin backbone for cleavage by polygalacturonases or pectate lyases. We identified candidate arabinanases of the family GH43 in the root-knot nematode genomes and in the draft genomes of the cyst nematodes Heterodera glycines and Globodera pallida. No other significant similarity was found in animals, but a series of candidate homologs was identified in bacteria, oomycetes, and fungi. Root-knot and cyst nematode GH43 enzymes form a monophyletic group in our phylogenies (Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). This suggests that a GH43 enzyme was present in the last common ancestor of these nematodes. Thus, the possibility of finding an enzyme from this family in other Tylenchina remains open. Actinomycetales GH43 enzymes appear to be the most closely related to nematode GH43 enzymes. This suggests that GH43 genes have been acquired in nematodes via LGT of bacterial origin (probably an ancestral or relative of Actinomycetales). Interestingly, a putative arabinogalactan endo-1,4-β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.89) from family GH53, unrelated to GH43, was found in ESTs from the cyst nematode Heterodera schachtii, and we identified only a homolog in the draft genome of H. glycines (19, 20), suggesting that it is restricted to cyst nematodes.Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on earth, and cellulases secreted by plant-parasitic nematodes allow its breakdown during root invasion (5, 21). In clade IV nematodes, cellulases from a subfamily of family GH5 (8) and those from family GH45 have been characterized. GH5 cellulases have been reported in Tylenchina and in one Aphelenchoidea species (18), whereas GH45 cellulases were reported only in Aphelenchoidea (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). No nematode species has been found to harbor both families of cellulases, suggesting that they are mutually exclusive. We identified candidate homologs of GH5 cellulases in bacteria, in two insects that feed on plants, Psacothea hilaris (22) and Apriona germari (23), and in gut digestive symbionts of termites. Interestingly, as opposed to nematode cellulase genes, those found in insects are intronless. GH5 cellulases from clade IV nematodes form a highly supported monophyletic group (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Their closest orthologs are found in the two insects, in Cytophaga hutchinsonii, and in other bacteria. Assuming that the two insect cellulase genes are endogenous, this topology suggests two hypotheses: (i) two LGT events occurred from a similar bacterial source in these insects and in clade IV nematodes or (ii) a cellulase gene was already present in the last common ancestor of these animals. The second hypothesis appears unlikely because their otherwise general absence in nematodes and insects would require many independent gene losses. An origin in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes is even less likely because GH5 enzymes found in plants and fungi belong to subfamilies distinct from that found in nematodes and are more distantly related than those of bacteria. In a set of nematode cellulases, a cellulose-binding CBM2 module is appended at the C-terminal end (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). This module is found neither in plants nor in fungi although association of CBM2 modules with GH5 modules is frequent in bacteria. This observation reinforces the hypothesis of the acquisition of nematode GH5 cellulases via LGT of bacterial origin. Notably, none of the two reported insect cellulases bear a CBM2 module.Phylogenetic trees of cellulose/hemicellulose-modifying proteins and expansin-like proteins. (A) GH5 cellulases.

Groups supported by PP values higher than 0.8 were collapsed. RKN, root-knot nematode; CN for cyst nematode.Xylanases catalyze the degradation of xylose, the main constituent of hemicellulose. All xylanases reported in nematodes belong to a subfamily of family GH5 that is clearly distinct from that of the cellulases discussed above. We found candidate nematode xylanase only in root-knot nematodes and Radopholus similis, and our phylogenetic analysis showed that they form a monophyletic group (Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Nematode xylanases are nested among clusters of bacterial xylanases, and their closest ortholog is a protein from the soil bacteria Clostridium acetobutylicum. This suggests that an ancestral xylanase was acquired via LGT at least in the common ancestor of root-knot nematodes and R. similis. As the common ancestor of these species is also the ancestor of cyst nematodes (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), the absence of GH5 xylanase in these nematodes suggests that they were either secondarily lost in this lineage or not yet identified. Alternatively, enzymes from another family may perform the same function in cyst nematodes. This is the case for cellulases discussed previously that belong to different and mutually exclusive families (GH5, GH45) but perform the same enzymatic activity in nematodes.Expansins (EXPNs) are not enzymes per se but loosen the noncovalent interactions between the constituents of the plant cell wall (24). They are typically plant proteins, but a functional EXPN has been characterized in cyst nematodes (25). Candidate EXPNs are present as multigenic families in root-knot nematodes (7, 26) and have also been found in other plant-associated nematodes (27, 28). Interestingly, we identified a homolog in Xiphinema index, a clade I plant-parasitic nematode (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Our phylogenetic analysis shows that EXPNs from all plant-parasitic nematodes, including X. index, are grouped in a highly supported monophyletic group (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Two hypotheses can be formulated concerning their origin. The first hypothesis says that a single acquisition occurred in the last common ancestor of clade IV and clade I nematodes with subsequent losses in the numerous nematode taxa not associated with plants. This appears unlikely and in contradiction with the current hypothesis of three independent emergences of plant parasitism in nematodes (29). The second hypothesis suggests that two LGT events from similar bacterial donor species occurred independently in clade I and clade IV nematode lineages. This is further supported by the noncongruence between the relative position of plant-parasitic nematode lineages in the EXPN phylogeny and the actual taxonomy (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).A feature common to several GH5 cellulases and EXPNs is the presence of an appended CBM2 cellulose-binding module. In nematodes and bacteria, proteins only made of a single CBM2 module can be found. In root-knot and cyst nematodes, these proteins are called cellulose-binding proteins (CBPs). A CBP from the cyst nematode H. schachtii has been shown to interact with a plant pectin-methylesterase, promoting degradation of its cell wall (30). CBM2 modules are frequently present in bacteria and otherwise found only in a few mollusks associated with a GH9 cellulase module. Our similarity searches using nematode CBM2 modules as queries returned a series of bacterial CBM2’s but none from mollusks, indicating that they are distantly related and probably have a distinct origin. All CBM2’s found in nematodes form a monophyletic group, and most closely related CBM2 modules are those of actinobacteria (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). This suggests that, in plant-parasitic nematodes, CBM2’s appended to other different modules have a common bacterial origin. We observed no clearly distinct groups separating CBM2’s appended to EXPN modules from those appended to GH5 modules, suggesting that domain shuffling occurred. In root-knot nematodes, CBPs form a monophyletic group closely related to a group of CBM2’s appended to GH5 cellulases. In contrast, CBPs of cyst nematodes are more closely related to CBM2’s appended to EXPN modules. This suggests that root-knot and cyst nematode CBPs derive from CBM2-bearing cellulases and EXPNs, respectively. The secretion of CBM2-bearing cellulases in plants has been demonstrated along the migratory path of cyst nematodes that migrate intracellularly and destroy the walls of the cells that they travel through (31, 32). No in planta localization data have been published for these proteins in root-knot nematodes that migrate intercellularly without damaging plant cells. Our immunolocalization studies on tomato roots infected with M. incognita showed the secretion of CBM2-bearing proteins by root-knot nematodes during migratory stages (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). Interestingly, we also detected these proteins in later sedentary parasitism stages in eggs about to be extruded by the female and at its vulva region (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). This suggests a role for these proteins, probably in successful egg laying, a process necessary for spreading the offspring of nematodes to surrounding roots, which is crucial for their parasitic life cycle.Immunodetection of CBM2-bearing proteins within adult sedentary females of M. incognita during parasitism of tomato roots.

Control images are available in the SI Appendix, Fig. S10.Although our phylogenetic analyses show that bacterial cell-wall–modifying proteins are the most closely related to those of nematodes, suggesting acquisition via LGT, the alternative hypothesis of descent from a common ancestor in eukaryotes, cannot be totally ruled out. To test the likelihood of this alternative hypothesis, we have compared constrained trees in which all eukaryotic homologs were put together in monophyletic groups to the unconstrained trees that we obtained. Statistical testing allowed us to reject with high confidence the topologies presenting monophyly of eukaryotes in all families except the EXPNs for which monophyly of fungal and nematode genes is only slightly less likely (SI Appendix, Table S2 A–F).Our tree topologies show that the abundance of multigenic families (cellulases, pectate lyases, and EXPNs) in plant-parasitic nematodes is due to a series of duplications that started after acquisition by LGT events and before the separation of the different clade IV nematode lineages. Duplications that pursued independently after the separation of root-knot and cyst nematodes contibuted the most to this abundance. From the available plant-parasitic nematode genomes, only a few duplications appear to have continued at a species-specific level. All families of cell wall-modifying proteins feature gene structures with multiple introns that contradict the hypothesis of bacterial contamination. In families that are present in several clade IV nematode lineages, at least one intron position could be identified as shared between all lineages, suggesting that these introns were gained early after LGT and before the separation of these different lineages (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). In M. incognita, considering GC content and codon usage, LGT-acquired genes are indistinguishable from the other M. incognita genes (SI Appendix, Fig. S12, and Tables S3 and S4). This ensemble of observations reinforces the hypothesis of ancient transfer.Duplication events that led to multigenic families could have been under positive selective pressure as proposed for other species (33). Such duplications can promote subfunctionalization and neo-functionalization or increase the level of transcribed genes. The dual protein localization pattern of CBM2-bearing proteins, during both migratory and late sedentary stages of infection, may reflect neo- or subfunctionalization.Our analysis shows that LGT events from several independent bacterial sources most likely gave rise to the six different gene families involved in plant cell-wall modification in clade IV plant-parasitic nematodes. Consistent with this hypothesis is the absence of genomic clusters grouping members of different families that could be a sign of cotransfer from an identical source (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). Four different groups of bacteria can be viewed as potential donors for these six cell-wall–modifying gene families. Three of these soil bacteria are notorious plant pathogens or are associated with symbiotic interactions within plant roots (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S14). Being sympatric with plant-parasitic nematodes, these soil bacteria satisfy the most elemental criterion to make LGT possible. However, how the genes are successfully transferred to the germline and then fixed in populations and species is not evident. Gene transfers from algae to the nuclear genome of their predator, a sea slug, have recently been shown (34). At least one example of a nematode that spends part of its life cycle in plant tissue and feeds on plant-symbiotic bacteria is known (35). The bacteria that they feed on possess plant cell-wall degradation genes, and this nematode belongs to the Cephalobidae family, a lineage closely related to clade IV plant-parasitic nematodes (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Thus, acquisition through feeding can be hypothesized. An alternative hypothesis is gene transfers from endosymbiotic bacteria. Such events have been shown in several other animals, including nematodes, probably aided by physical proximity of endosymbionts and germline cells (2). Endosymbionts have been reported in several plant-parasitic nematodes (36–38), all at the vicinity of gametes or eggs. Although transfers appear more evident for endosymbionts, the presence of plant cell wall degradation genes is less likely in these bacteria.At least one other example of gene transfer from bacteria to nematodes has been reported. Interestingly, this also involved a gene coding for an enzyme, although in this case the transfer probably took place in the last common ancestor of all nematodes (39) and appears not specifically linked to a given lifestyle. In animals other than nematodes, a similar case of massive gene transfers has been reported from bdelloid rotifers (4). Intriguingly, these transfers also concerned genes involved in the degradation of polysaccharides, and gains of introns were also reported. As for the nematode transfers, several transferred genes in these rotifers were indistinguishable from the endogenous genes, suggesting ancient acquisition. Gene transfers in bdelloid rotifers appear to have been fixed preferentially in telomeric regions, and transposable elements may play a role in successful transfer. These features were not observed in nematode transfers. Conversely, the massive duplications that we observed after transfer in nematodes have not been noted in bdelloid rotifers. Bacteria appear as common candidate donors in both reports, but fungi and plants are also candidate donors for bdelloid rotifers. In contrast to plant-parasitic nematodes, in bdelloid rotifers, transfers may have been facilitated by their peculiar life cycle during which they undergo desiccation involving DNA fragmentation and dispersal of membranes, which allows foreign DNA to be incorporated during recovery. Regardless of the possible mechanisms, both these cases highlight the potential importance of LGT in animals and suggest that this phenomenon may be more frequent than usually considered.We have shown that in plant-parasitic nematodes, a whole set of genes encoding proteins involved in the plant cell wall degradation was most likely acquired by LGT of bacterial origin. The function of the transferred gene products is directly linked to the capacity of these nematodes to parasitize plants. Selective advantage associated with transfer of these genes probably has driven their duplications and facilitated fixation in the different populations and species of plant-parasitic nematodes. Far from being negligible, these LGT events certainly have radically remolded evolutionary trends in recipient organisms, and similar roles in other animals can be expected to be discovered.Homologs of nematode plant cell-wall–degrading proteins were searched in public databases and checked for significance using the approach described in SI Appendix. Multiple alignments were done with MUSCLE (40). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using two approaches: a Bayesian method with mrBayes (41) using a mixture of models and a bootstrapped maximum-likelihood approach with RAxML (42) using the evolutionary models returning the highest posterior probabilities in Bayesian analyses. For both methods, we used an evaluation of the proportion of invariable rates as well as of the shape of the γ-distribution of evolutionary rates. The procedure is detailed in SI Appendix.We statistically tested the significance of the obtained tree topologies in comparison with alternative trees in which all eukaryotic homologs were constrained to form monophyletic groups using the program CONSEL (43). Details of the procedure are available in SI Appendix.We used the EMBOSS (44) software suite to calculate the codon usage and GC content of plant cell-wall degradation genes and compared these values to those calculated for the rest of the protein-coding genes. Details of these analyses are available in the SI Appendix. Genome localization of plant cell wall degradation genes in M. incognita were obtained from GFF files of the genome sequence (7).Information about the intron/exon structures was extracted from the literature and from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's GenBank. For sequences resulting from genome-sequencing projects, intron/exon structures were deduced from the alignment of protein models with the corresponding genome sequences using the procedure detailed in SI Appendix.Antibodies were raised against a peptide from the CBM2 module of M. incognita ENG1 cellulase. Dissected tomato roots infected with M. incognita were fixed and cut in sections. Slides harboring the nematode feeding sites were immunolabeled with a serum containing the anti-ENG1 antibodies. Slides were observed with a microscope equipped for epifluorescence and differential interference contrast optics. Full details of the procedure used are available in SI Appendix.We thank H.

PMC2956484,"An efficient and versatile synthesis of GlcNAcstatins—potent and selective O-GlcNAcase inhibitors built on the tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine scaffold",False,"We report a novel approach to the synthesis of GlcNAcstatins—members of an emerging family of potent and selective inhibitors of peptidyl O-GlcNAc hydrolase build upon tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine scaffold. Making use of a streamlined synthetic sequence featuring de novo synthesis of imidazoles from glyoxal, ammonia and aldehydes, a properly functionalised linear GlcNAcstatin precursor has been efficiently prepared starting from methyl 3,4-O-(2′,3′-dimethoxybutane-2′,3′-diyl)-α-d-mannopyranoside. Subsequent ring closure of the linear precursor in an intramolecular SN2 process furnished the key fused d-mannose-imidazole GlcNAcstatin precursor in excellent yield. Finally, a sequence of transformations of this key intermediate granted expeditious access to a variety of the target compounds bearing a C(2)-phenethyl group and a range of N(8) acyl substituents. The versatility of the new approach stems from an appropriate choice of a set of acid labile permanent protecting groups on the monosaccharide starting material. Application was demonstrated by the synthesis of GlcNAcstatins containing polyunsaturated and thiol-containing amido substituents.Reversible posttranslational modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins in eukaryotic cells by glycosylation of (surface exposed) serines and threonines with 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl residues (O-GlcNAc) is believed to play important roles in diverse cellular processes, such as transcription, translation, signal transduction and protein trafficking and degradation.1–3 There is evidence to suggest that the faulty interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and competitive or synergistic phosphorylation of specific proteins is involved in progression and pathology of several metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus an increased level of O-GlcNAcylation on proteins along the insulin signalling pathway has been proposed to be involved in insulin sensitivity,4,5 and hyper-phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau that marks the development of the Alzheimer disease was shown to be reciprocal with the abnormally low O-GlcNAcylation.6The molecular mechanisms and biological implications of O-GlcNAc attachment/hydrolysis are currently the subject of intense multidisciplinary investigation. In a striking contrast to the conceptually related reversible protein phosphorylation, regulated by a plethora of highly specific kinases and phosphatases, the dynamic cycling of O-GlcNAc in eukaryotes is achieved by a single pair of enzymes: peptidyl O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT, CAZY family GT417) and peptidyl O-GlcNAc hydrolase (OGA, GH84).It has so far not been possible to study the cell biological effect of hypo-O-GlcNAcylation due to a lack of OGT inhibitors. However, OGA, with a number of stable functional substrate analogues available, provides an excellent opportunity to study the cellular effects of inhibitor-induced hyper-O-GlcNAcylation.A number of potent OGA inhibitors have been developed in the recent decades, including PUGNAc (Ki=50 nM, hOGA)8–10 and NAG-thiazoline (Ki=70 nM, hOGA)11,12 (Fig. 1). Although both compounds are prone to hydrolysis in aqueous solutions and also potently inhibit lysosomal β-hexosaminidases (HexA/HexB), they became the standard tools for studying protein over O-GlcNAcylation. Recently, systematic variation of the size and electronic properties of the thiazoline substituent resulted in the discovery of the highly potent, selective and hydrolytically stable inhibitor Thiamet-G (Ki=21±3 nM, hOGA).13In parallel, a search for novel, potent and selective OGA inhibitors focussed our attention on the naturally occurring hexosaminidase inhibitor nagstatin14,15 (Fig. 1). Its unique tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (fused sugar-imidazole) bicyclic scaffold and outstanding potency fuelled the research of Tatsuta et al. on the total synthesis of the parent compound and analogues.16,17 Ensuing work of Vasella et al. has established sugar-imidazoles among the most powerful β-glycosidase inhibitors.18 The origin of this potency was attributed to the half-chair conformation of the bicyclic core mimicking the flattened geometry of the putative pyranosyl oxocarbenium ion during the hydrolysis of glycosidic bond. The importance of the [1,2-a] fused imidazole ring was deduced to stem from in-plane protonation of the pseudo-anomeric nitrogen atom with a laterally positioned catalytic acid, that would proceed along the same trajectory as protonation of a glycosidic bond to yield the β-anomeric oxygen leaving group.19 Additionally, in contradiction with the earlier Tatsuta’s data, C(2) substituted fused sugar-imidazoles were found to show improved inhibition over unsubstituted analogues. The effect, particularly profound in the phenethyl-substituted fused hexose-imidazoles,20 has been also replicated for the series of C(2) phenethyl-substituted fused pentose-imidazoles.21 Surprisingly, the inhibition of hexosaminidases with nagstatin and analogous fused 2-acetamido-2-deoxy sugar-imidazoles, was only tested very recently, when synthesis of gluco-nagstatin was reported by Vasella et al.22,23Based on these data and the availability of the crystal structure of a bacterial OGA (bOGA) homologue from Clostridium perfringens in complex with PUGNAc24 we designed GlcNAcstatin 6 (Fig. 1)—the founding member of a novel family of OGA inhibitors built on the fused d-glucosamine-imidazole scaffold. In a preliminary communication we reported synthesis and enzymatic profiling of this compound to reveal its outstanding potency and selectivity (Ki=4 pM, bOGA).25 Recently we reported the evaluation of a small set of GlcNAcstatins as inhibitors of human OGA to confirm that both potency and selectivity could also be achieved with the human enzyme.26The synthesis of GlcNAcstatin was provisionally designed as a consolidation of two existing pathways to the fused sugar-imidazoles (Fig. 2).25 It exploited the highly efficient SN2 substitution of the OH(8) group in the manno-configured C(2)-branched derivative 4 (tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine numbering) leading to the gluco-azide 5 in accordance with Vasella’s findings.23 In turn, the key iodo-imidazole 3 was prepared using an extensively modified Tatsuta’s approach from the l-xylose 1 through the linear polyhydroxylated l-gulo-imidazole 2.16 The overall competence of the synthesis, however, was undermined by the poor efficacy of the opening step, which required separation of mixtures of diastereomers and unproductive protective group exchange. Further progress on the synthesis of GlcNAcstatins aimed at the development of more potent/selective inhibitors of hOGA was hampered by routine supply of the required intermediates. Aiming at the synthesis of derivatives bearing unsaturated or thiol-containing amide substituents, the abolishment of an array of permanent benzyl protecting groups on the sugar moiety would result in optimization of the synthetic scheme. To fulfil these objectives we developed a novel synthetic approach to GlcNAcstatins, making use of de novo synthesis of linear polyhydroxylated imidazoles21,27 from glyoxal, ammonia and chiral aldehydes available by reductive cleavage of sugar primary iodides (Bernet–Vasella reaction).28We identified methyl 3,4-O-(2′,3′-dimethoxybutane-2′,3′-diyl)-α-d-mannopyranoside 12, easily available on a large scale,29 as the optimal monosaccharide starting material (Scheme 1). Robust 3,4-O-bis-acetal protecting group in 12, meeting the criteria for the acid labile permanent protecting group, would keep corresponding hydroxyls intact through the synthesis. The rigid bicyclic framework of 12 would also allow efficient differentiation of the remaining hydroxyl groups via selective alkylation of the OH(2) according to the Ley’s protocol30 thus securing a streamlined subsequent introduction of the 6-iodo substituent (12→11). Reductive cleavage of 11 would then afford the open-chain aldehyde, which is instantly ready for the three component construction of the imidazole ring (11→10). Asymmetric dihydroxylation of the double bond in 10 followed by selective protection of OH(6) with suitable silyl ether (acid labile) and bis-iodination of the imidazole ring would generate the required l-gulo configured cyclisation precursor 9.We anticipated that after this point a synthetic sequence comprising of tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine ring closure (9→7) and selective C(3) deiodination of the imidazole (7→8) would give access to the key fused d-mannose-imidazole precursor of GlcNAcstatins 8, similar to the one successfully transformed into GlcNAcstatin in the provisional synthesis.25In the event selective p-methoxybenzylation of the starting mannoside 12 with 1.15 equiv of p-methoxybenzyl chloride (PMBCl) in the presence of n-Bu4NI provided the expected 2-O-PMB ether 13 in about 50% yield along with 25% of 2,6-di-O-PMB derivative 14 (Scheme 2). Notably, the control experiment with benzyl bromide afforded the corresponding 2-O-Bn ether in 78% yield, in agreement with the original data.30 We found that the primary PMB group in compound 14 could be selectively removed by hydrogenolysis under controlled conditions to give a 10:1:9 mixture of 2-O- and 6-O-monoalkylated derivatives and the starting material 14 from which the 2-O-PMB ether 13 was isolated in 50% yield after flash chromatography. This observation was used advantageously to increase the overall yield of the requisite compound 13 to 60%, starting from the bis-acetal 12. Substitution of the OH(6) in 13 was then achieved using PPh3/imidazole/I2 in hot toluene31 to furnish the iodo-derivative 15 in 75% yield on 30 mmol scale. The ensuing reductive splitting of the pyranoside ring of 15 using a variant of the Bernet–Vasella reaction28 with freshly activated zinc in aqueous THF at 65 °C gave the intermediate open-chain aldehyde, which on treatment with 40% glyoxal solution in 7 M methanolic ammonia initially at 0 °C and then at 70 °C for 2 h consistently produced the key intermediate imidazole 16 in a rewarding 70% overall yield.Reagents and conditions: (i) PMBCl, NaH, n-Bu4NI, DMF, rt, 16 h, 50%; (ii) I2, ImH, PPh3, toluene, 70 °C, 3 h, 75%; (iii) H2, Pd/C, MeOH/EtOAc, 3 h, 50%; (iv) (a) Zn, THF/H2O (10:1), 65 °C, 1 h, (b) 40% aqueous glyoxal, 7 M NH3/MeOH, 0–70 °C, 2 h, 70%.Initial catalytic dihydroxylation of the double bond in the open-chain imidazole 16 with K2(OsO4)/K3[Fe(CN)6] was found to be highly stereoselective, yet unfortunately providing the unwanted d-manno-configured derivative 17 as a sole product isolated in 78% yield after selective silylation of the primary hydroxy group with triisopropyl chlorosilane (Scheme 3). Strikingly, running the reaction in the presence of varying amounts of the β-selective (DHQD)2-PHAL ligand (0.1–5%) did not affect the stereochemical outcome or efficiency of the process, suggesting an overpowering intrinsic facial stereospecificity of the substrate.32 The absolute configuration of 17 was established after its transformation into the fused sugar-imidazole derivative 18 by treatment with Tf2O in pyridine for 1 h at rt. Formation of the bicyclic compound was confirmed by HRMS and NMR spectra. In particular, the presence of the (C8a)–(H5) and (C3)–(H5) (tetrahydroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine numbering) cross-peaks in the HMBC spectra proved that imidazole moiety was covalently bound to C(5). Assuming clean inversion of the configuration at C(5) occurred during cyclisation, observation of the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) between protons H(7) and H(5∗a, b) in compound 18 was only compatible with its l-gulo configuration and, respectively, d-manno configuration of the starting compound 17.Reagents and conditions: (i) (a) K2(OsO4)/K3[Fe(CN)6], K2CO3, CH3SO2NH2, t-BuOH/THF/water, rt, 24 h, (b) TIPSCl, Py, 50 °C, 16 h, 78%; (ii) Tf2O, pyridine, −15 °C tort, 1 h, 92%; (iii) (a) (COCl)2, DMSO, DCM, −60 °C then Et3N, (b) NaBH4, EtOH, rt, 16 h, 80%; (iv) Tf2O, Py, C2H4Cl2, −15 °C then 50 °C, 3 h, 90%.The origin of the exceptional substrate-controlled selectivity of the dihydroxylation reaction is not immediately obvious. It is possible that it could stem from formation of a complex of osmium tetroxide with the imidazole; in this case, formation of the d-manno-configured product would result from the intramolecular delivery of the reagent onto the eclipsed rotamer of the double bond. On the other hand, the same stereochemical outcome could result from an effective shielding of one of the diastereotopic faces of the double bond by the bulky C1 substituent. In this case, however, the double bond should react in a less favourable bisecting conformation. Whatever the origin of the unique stereoselectivity of the process, the reported observations provide a rare glimpse on the barely explored stereodirecting properties of bis-acetal protected substrates in dihydroxylation reactions.33In an attempt to invert the configuration of OH(4) in compound 17 we have found that it remained unchanged in the Mitsunobu esterification with DIAD/PPh3/p-nitrobenzoic acid. However, a simple two-step Swern oxidation34—NaBH4 reduction sequence cleanly provided a 1:10 mixture of the epimeric alcohols 17 and 19. The ample difference of the retention factors allowed the individual isomers to be isolated in 9% and 80% yields, respectively, by chromatographic separation. Operational simplicity and scalability of the devised sequence resulted in only a limited exploration of alternative, more selective, reducing agents. Addition of cerium chloride (NaBH4, CeCl3·7H2O/MeOH; −78 °C to rt) did not change the stereoselectivity, whereas DIBAL failed to reduce the intermediate ketone even at ambient temperature.The configuration of OH(4) in compound 19 was formally established after closure of the bicyclic compound 20, which required heating of the intermediate bis-triflate at 50 °C for 3 h to go to completion (Scheme 3). The observation of the NOE between H(6) and H(5∗a, b) in compound 20 established its d-manno absolute configuration and consequently the l-gulo configuration of compound 19.Similar to the stereochemical outcome of the dihydroxylation of 16, the formal Felkin–Anh stereochemistry of the reduction of the intermediate ketone leading to the preferential formation of the alcohol 19 is difficult to rationalise. Due to the presence of the rigid bis-acetal framework adorned with the imidazole ring and multiple alkoxy substituents, a choice of opportunities for remote chelate formation is endless making the analysis in terms of chelate or non-chelate models not conclusive.In line with our previous findings25 we initially decided to convert the open-chain imidazole 19 into the bis-iodo-derivative 21 prior to cyclisation to avoid the drastic iodination conditions used by Vasella et al. for iodination of preformed fused sugar-imidazoles.35 As expected, iodination of 19 with 2.5 equiv of NIS in MeCN proceeded smoothly to give the requisite compound 21 (Scheme 4). However, all attempts to effect its annulation into the targeted tetrahydroimidazo[l,2-a]pyridine derivative 22 failed in marked contrast with the highly effective cyclisation of the parent non-iodinated compound 19 and previously observed smooth cyclisation of the benzylated/benzoylated analogue not possessing bis-acetal protection.25 The lack of reactivity may be explained by the spatial congestion developing in a transition state between the iodine substituent at C(3) position of the imidazole ring and the bulky primary triisopropylsilyloxy group.Reagents and conditions: (i) NIS 2.5 equiv, MeCN, 6 h, rt, 95%; (ii) Tf2O, Py, C2H4Cl2, −15 °C then 50 °C; (iii) NIS 10 equiv, DMF, 85 °C, 36 h, 80% or NIS 3 equiv, MeCN, PPTS, 80 °C, 3 h, 65%; (iv) EtMgBr, THF, 0 °C, 10 min, 88%.Finally we found that post-cyclisation iodination of the fused sugar-imidazole 20 using an even more vigorous variant of Vasella’s original conditions (10 equiv NIS, DMF, 85 °C, 36 h) furnished the key diiodide 22 as slightly yellow oil in 80% yield after chromatographic purification of the very dark reaction mixture (Scheme 4). Alternatively, iodination of 20 could be performed using 3 equiv of NIS in MeCN at 80 °C in the presence of 1 equiv of PPTS36 giving the requisite compound 22 in 60% yield. The detected formation of p-methoxybenzyl iodide as a by-product pointed at an inadequate stability of the PMB protective group towards the NIS/PPTS combination as a principal reason for the diminished efficacy of bis-iodination. In the concluding step, the regioselective mono-deiodination of 22 at C(3) with EtMgBr/THF at 0 °C was executed without incident to give the key mono-iodoimidazole 23 in 88% yield.It is worth noting that explorative one-step iodination/iodocyclisation of the unsaturated open-chain imidazole 16 with 3 equiv of NIS resulted in transient formation of the bis-iodinated imidazole 24 and, finally, triply iodinated tetrahydro-5H-imidazo[1,2-a]azepine derivative 25 in 78% yield as a result of apparent anti-Baldwin 6-endo-trig cyclisation (Scheme 5). The structure of the compound 25 was initially deduced from the high field shift of C(6) (δ 26.7) (imidazo-azepine numbering) in the 13C NMR spectrum, pointing at the iodine substitution site. This was further confirmed by observation of the (C9a)–(H5a)/(5b) cross-peaks in the HMBC spectrum, revealing covalent connection of the imidazole and the methylene group of the azepine ring. The configuration of the C(6) iodo substituent was established from the presence of the H(6)–H(8) cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum showing spatial proximity of the corresponding protons.Reagents and conditions: (i) NIS 3 equiv, MeCN, 6 h, rt, 78%.Subsequently, a highly efficient Sonogashira coupling37 of the key iodoimidazole 23 with phenylacetylene provided the fully assembled precursor of GlcNAcstatins 26 with the C(2) phenylethynyl substituent in place in 93% yield (Scheme 6). Critical stereoselective conversion of the manno-configured 26 into the gluco-azide 28 was achieved in two steps starting with oxidative removal of the PMB protective group with DDQ (26→27; 83%) followed by azidation of the alcohol 27 with DPPA/DBU under optimized conditions (toluene, 80 °C, 2 h) to produce the requisite azide 28 in 93% yield as the single product. The gluco-configuration of the compound 28 was unambiguously deduced from the value of the corresponding coupling constant (J7,8 9.5 Hz) as well as the presence of H(6)–H(8) cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum.Reagents and conditions: (i) PhCCH, CuI, Et3N, Pd(PPh3)4, DMF, 80 °C, 16 h, 93%; (ii) DDQ, DCM/H2O, 4 h, 83%; (iii) DPPA, DBU, toluene, rt then 80 °C, 2 h, 93%; (iv) (a) H2, Pd/C, MeOH or EtOAc, 1 h (b) (RCO)2O, Et3N, DCM for 29–31 or PyBOP, DIPEA, RCO2H, DCM, rt, 16 h, for 32–34; (v) TFA/H2O (95:5), rt, 36 h, 60–80%; (vi) DMF, MeONa/MeOH, DTT, 2 h, 56%.Starting from the azide 28 a panel of fully protected N-acylated GlcNAcstatins precursors 29–34 encompassed derivatives of acetic, propionic, iso-butyric, valeric, 2,4-pentanedioic38 and 3-(acetylthio)propionic acids has been prepared using a uniform sequence consisted of simultaneous hydrogenation both of the triple bond and the azido group over Pd catalyst followed by reaction of the intermediate amine with suitable acylating agents.As the concluding step of the synthesis, removal of the permanent protecting groups (TIPS and 3,4-O-dimethoxybutanediyl bis-acetal) was intended to be achieved with acid hydrolysis in one step. In the event the reaction was found to be prohibitively slow. When solutions of a substrate in DCM were exposed to the increasing (10–50%) concentrations of TFA/water (95:5) in DCM, both protecting groups remained intact for a period of several hours. Moreover, it appeared that the TIPS group could be selectively removed by treatment with 4 M HCl in THF for 16 h, leaving the butanediyl bis-acetal protection mostly unchanged. Our findings appear to be in agreement with a singular report suggesting that removal of 3,4-O-bis-acetal protection in N-acetyl glucosamine derivatives could be a slow process.39 It seems that protonation of the imidazole ring of the fused N-acetylated glucosamine-imidazoles 29–34 contributes significantly to the acid stability of the butanediyl bis-acetal protection making it even more resistant towards hydrolysis than in N-acetyl glucosamine derivatives. Finally, global deprotection of 29–34 was achieved by 36 h treatment with aqueous TFA (95:5) to furnish the requisite compounds 35–40 in acceptable yields after reversed phase chromatography purification. To obtain the 3-thiopropionic acid derivative 41, S-acetyl protection was finally removed from 40 with MeONa/MeOH in the presence of dithioerythrol.We reported here a novel approach to the synthesis of a family of potent and selective inhibitors of peptidyl O-GlcNAcase (GlcNAcstatins) built on the fused d-glucosamine-imidazole scaffold. At the outset of the synthesis a short practical route to the densely functionalised open-chain imidazole bearing a terminal double bond has been developed using a novel combination of Bernet–Vasella reaction and de novo imidazole synthesis. Dihydroxylation of the double bond in this intermediate was found to be exclusive substrate controlled process leading to formation of the unwanted d-manno-configured product. The inversion of configuration of the OH(4) group has been achieved by a serendipitously found by-pass method using stereoselective reduction of the intermediate ketone. The obtained l-gulo substrate resisted all attempts to be cyclised into bicyclic derivative when iodine atoms have been preinstalled at the imidazole ring. In contrast, seamless cyclisation of the non-iodinated precursor into the requisite fused d-mannose-imidazole was easily achieved using the standard protocol. Ultimately, a Sonogashira reaction of C(2) iodo-derivative of the cyclised compound with phenylacetylene provided highly efficient access to the advanced intermediate in the GlcNAcstatin synthesis bearing a phenylethynyl substituent at the C(2) position. Starting from this compound, a set of GlcNAcstatins with assorted amido substituents has been prepared. Although the very last step of the synthesis, i.e., acidolytic removal of the permanent triisopropylsilyl and cyclic bis-acetal protections was found to be rather sluggish, the versatility of the new synthetic approach was clearly demonstrated by the preparation of GlcNAcstatin derivatives of 2,4-pentanedioic and 3-mercaptopropionic acids intrinsically incompatible with the hydrogenolytic deprotection routines. The new approach also gives access to rapid future exploration of alternative C(2) substituents that may yield even more potent, selective and cell-permeable GlcNAcstatin derivatives.All reactions were performed in oven-dried glassware under an inert atmosphere (argon) unless noted otherwise. Dichloromethane, acetonitrile, triethylamine were anhydrous grade solvents from Fluka kept over molecular sieves. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck silica gel 60 F254 aluminium plates (0.25 mm). Compounds were visualized by UV light, or by dipping the plate into acidic potassium permanganate aqueous solution followed by washing out the excess of the reagent, or by charring the plate at ca. 300 °C after dipping in a 5% phosphomolybdic acid solution in ethanol. Flash chromatographic separations were performed on Isco RediSep flash columns using Buchi gradient pump system. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE II 500 spectrometer. Splitting patterns of spectral multiplets are indicated as s, singlet; d, doublet; br s broad singlet; br d broad doublet; t triplet; quint quintet. Signals were assigned by means of DEPT, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained on a microTOF Bruker Daltonics instrument. Optical rotations were measured in chloroform on a Perkin–Elmer 343 polarimeter at 20 °C.FT-IR spectra were recorded on Perkin–Elmer Spectrum BX instrument.To a cooled (ice-bath) solution of 12 (15.16 g, 49.16 mmol) and p-methoxybenzyl chloride (7.5 mL, 55.31 mmol) in DMF (250 mL) sodium hydride (60% in oil; 4 g, 100 mmol) was added in portions.

PMC2974045,"Structure-based Evolutionary Relationship of Glycosyltransferases: A Case Study of Vertebrate β1, 4-Galactosyltransferase, Invertebrate β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase and α-Polypeptidyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase",False,"Cell surface glycans play important cellular functions and are synthesized by glycosyltransferases. Structure and function studies show that the donor sugar specificity of the invertebrate β1,4-N-acetyl-glactosaminyltransferase (β4GalNAc-T) and the vertebrate β1,4-galactosyltransferase I (β4Gal-T1) are related by a single amino acid residue change. Comparison of the catalytic domain crystal structures of the β4Gal-T1 and the α-polypeptidyl-GalNAc-T (αppGalNAc-T) shows that their protein structure and sequences are similar. Therefore, it seems that the invertebrate β4GalNAc-T and the catalytic domain of αppGalNAc-T might have emerged from a common primordial gene. When vertebrates emerged from invertebrates, the amino acid that determines the donor sugar specificity of the invertebrate β4GalNAc-T might have mutated, thus converting the enzyme to a β4Gal-T1 in vertebrates.Glycosyltransferases exist as a super family of enzymes and constitute 1 to 2% of the human genome [1]. These transferases have been thought to have evolved by gene duplication and divergence as evidenced from their high protein sequence and gene structure (exon/intron organization) similarity among the subfamily members [2–4]. They generally transfer a donor sugar from an activated donor substrate such as a nucleotide-diphosphate-sugar to an acceptor sugar, extending the glycan chain of glyco-proteins and glyco-lipids, one sugar moiety at a time. The complex glycans, synthesized by involving many glycosyltransferases, are known to have very important cellular functions [5]. Therefore, absence or lethal mutation in any glycosyltransferase gene and its corresponding protein might lead to a total absence of a sugar epitope, thus changing the cellular physiology. For example, in humans the αGal1-3βGal epitope is absent and has an anti-αGal IgG antibody against this epitope [6]. Sequencing of the human α1,3-galactosyltransferase gene that is responsible for the synthesis of this epitope has revealed that because of a number of lethal mutations, the active α3 galactosyltransferase enzyme can not be expressed in humans, thus explaining the absence of the epitope [7]. Similarly, sequencing of the human CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase gene showed an inactivating mutation that is responsible for the lack of the N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) in humans; Neu5Gc is otherwise widely found in most mammalian tissues [8]. The loss of Neu5Gc and access of its precursor N- acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) has been implicated in the evolution of their binding proteins, Siglecs, and in the evolutionary changes in the human lineage [9]. Similarly, other glycosyltransferases are known to have been involved in the evolution and diversification of species [10].In vertebrate cells, the most prevalent epitope, LacNAc (βGal1-4βGlcNAc), is recognized by asialoglycoprotein receptors [11]. Furthermore, a LacNAc moiety with a terminal sialic acid linked in different configurations is involved in immunological and cell signaling functions [12–14]. Thus, the galactose moiety in the LacNAc epitope seems to have played an important role in vertebrate evolution. In the presence of manganese, the β1,4-galactosyltransferase I (β4Gal-T1) enzyme transfers the donor sugar, galactose (Gal), from UDP-Gal to an acceptor sugar β-N-acetylglucosamine (βGlcNAc) synthesizing LacNAc, βGal1-4βGalNAc [15]. From the enzyme kinetic studies it has been known that the β4Gal-T1 poorly transfers N-acetylgalactosmine (GalNAc) from UDP-GalNAc to the acceptor sugar GlcNAc [16,17]. In the crystal structure of the bovine β4Gal-T1•Mn2+•UDP-GalNAc complex, the side-chain hydroxyl group of the Tyr289 residue forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of the N-acetyl group of the bound UDP-GalNAc molecule; due to the lack of enough space between them, the N-acetyl moiety is found in a unfavorable orientation (Figure 1a) [17]. It was reasoned that this steric hindrance could be responsible for the poor catalytic activity by the β4Gal-T1 enzyme with UDP-GalNAc as the donor substrate. Therefore, it was thought that a substitution of the Tyr289 residue with an amino acid with a less bulky side chain, such as Leu, Ile, or Asn, might not cause such steric hindrance and thereby would be expected to enhance the catalytic activity with UDP-GalNAc. Indeed, it was found that such substitution with any of these three amino acids enhanced the catalytic activity using UDP-GalNAc. The mutant enzyme with Leu substitution exhibited catalytic activity that was as efficient with the UDP-GalNAc as it was with the UDP-Gal. Therefore, the single amino acid, Tyr289, determines the donor sugar specificity of bovine β4Gal-T1 [17].(a) The crystal structure of the bovine β4Gal-T1•Mn2+•UDP-GalNAc complex (pdb 1OQM) with a GlcNAc molecule modeled in the acceptor binding site. The UDP-GalNAc and GlcNAc molecules are shown in a ball and stick diagram. The side-chain hydroxyl group of Tyr289 residue forms a hydrogen bond (shown as black dotted line) with the carbonyl oxygen atom of the N-acetyl group of the GalNAc moiety. (b) Protein sequence comparison of the bovine β4Gal-T1 shown near the vicinity of the Y289 residues (black arrow), along with its homolog proteins from various species. Only in the vertebrate homolog proteins is the Y289 residue conversed as a Tyr residue, whereas in the invertebrates it is either Leu or Ile.In contrast to vertebrate cells that have LacNAc moiety invertebrate cells have mainly a LacdiNAc moiety where β-N-acetylgalactosamine (βGalNAc) is 1–4 linked to βGlcNAc [18]. Thus, it seems that in the invertebrate cells the vertebrate β4Gal-T1, that is responsible for the synthesis of LacNAc moiety, is replaced by a β1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase (β4GalNAc-T) that synthesize the LacdiNAc moiety. Indeed in several invertebrates a β4GalNAc-T enzyme has been found that is homologous to the vertebrate β4Gal-T1 protein [19–22]. These two enzymes not only exhibit reasonable protein sequence similarity but also similar gene structure [23]. However, the corresponding Y289 residue of bovine β4Gal-T1 in the invertebrate β4GalNAc-T proteins is found either as Leu or Ile residue, suggesting that this amino acid change may be responsible for the altered donor sugar, UDP-GalNAc, specificity of these enzymes (Figure 1b) [20,21].To provide support for this hypothesis, we have expressed Drosophila β4GalNAc-TA protein, a homolog protein of vertebrate β4Gal-T1, that transfers GalNAc from UDP-GalNAc to the acceptor substrate GlcNAc; it transfers Gal from UDP-Gal to GlcNAc very poorly [23]. When the Ile289 residue is mutated to a Tyr residue, the mutant enzyme loses the catalytic activity with UDP-GalNAc; instead, it exhibits high catalytic activity with UDP-Gal transferring Gal to GlcNAc, thus confirming that this single amino acid determines the sugar donor specificity of Drosophila β4GalNAc-TA enzyme [23]. It seems that when the vertebrates emerged from the invertebrates nearly 500 million years ago, the vertebrate β4Gal-T1 enzyme might have also emerged from invertebrate β4GalNAc-T, by the single amino acid mutation of Leu/Ile in the β4GalNAc-TA to Tyr, thus converting the β4GalNAc-T to β4Gal-T (Figure 2) [23].Since the donor sugar specificity of the invertebrate β4GalNAc-T and vertebrate β4Gal-T are related by a single amino acid change, it is possible that when the vertebrate emerged from the invertebrate 500 million years ago, this single amino acid change might have happened, thus converting the invertebrate β4GalNAc-T enzyme to a β4Gal-T enzyme in the vertebrates. Furthermore, since the catalytic domains of β4Gal-T1 and αpptGalNAc-T enzymes exhibit protein structure, sequence, and gene structure similarity, the vertebrate β4GalNAc-T and the αpptGalNAc-T might have evolved from a common primordial gene by gene duplication and, further, during evolution the αpptGalNAc-T might have picked up the lectin domain to define its acceptor specificity. Since α-lactabumin binds and inhibits but does not modulate the invertebrate β4GalNAc-T enzyme, its binding site existed before the evolution of vertebrates. Only during the evolution of mammals did α-lactabumin evolve to bind to this site in the vertebrate β4Gal-T1 and modulate its acceptor sugar specificity to synthesize lactose during lactation of mammals.Lysozyme and α-lactalbumin (α-LA) share high similarity between their protein sequences and gene structures but have completely different biological functions [24]. These proteins are thought to have evolved from a primordial gene by a gene duplication nearly 300 million years ago. α-LA is a calcium binding protein that is only expressed in the mammary gland during lactation. The evolution of mammals has been associated with the appearance of α-LA in the mammary gland where it plays a role in the synthesis of lactose, a hallmark of mammals. α-LA modulates β4Gal-T1 by altering its acceptor specificity from GlcNAc to glucose (Glc), thus synthesizing the disaccharide lactose, βGal1-4βGlc [25]. Also, α-LA is known to inhibit the transfer of Gal to a GlcNAc acceptor by β4Gal-T1. Interestingly, we have found that α-LA binds to the wild-type Drosophila β4GalNAc-TA enzyme and inhibits the catalytic activity of this protein but it does not alter its acceptor specificity from GlcNAc to Glc [23]. Earlier, a similar property was also observed for the C. elegans β4GalNAc-T enzyme [20]. These observations suggest that the α-LA binding site existed even before the appearance of the vertebrate β4Gal-T1 protein, and that during the evolution of mammals, this site was utilized by α-lactalbumin to modulate the acceptor specificity of the β4Gal-T1 in mammals (Figure 2). This is further evidenced from the fact that the α-LA can bind and modulate the acceptor specificity of a non-mammal vertebrate β4Gal-T1 enzyme, like the one from chicken [26].Although the evolution of β1,4-galactosyltransferase appears to be coincidental with the appearence of vertebrates, the evolution of this enzyme played an important role in vertebrate development. For example, only in vertebates several sialyltransferases are found to synthesize varity of sialyated LacNAc containing glycans, and during the evolution of mammals α-LA was recruited for the synthesis of lactose. Similarly, different lectins had to be recruited to recognize these new glycoconjugates. Thus, the appearance of β1,4-galactosyltransferases in vertebrates created a boundary between vertebrate and invertebrate glycans and made it possible to expand the variety of glycoconjugates that were needed for vertebrate development.Having observed an evolutionary relationship between the vertebrate β4Gal-T1 and invertebrate β4GalNAc-T enzymes, it was important to find out if there are any other GalNAc-T enzymes that might be related to them. In all species, α-polypeptidyl-GalNAc-T (αppGalNAc-T) exists as a family of enzymes, and in the presence of manganese, they transfer GalNAc to the side-chain hydroxyl group of a Thr/Ser amino acid in a polypeptide acceptor [27]. In these transferases the presence of a lectin domain C-terminal to the catalytic domain and separated by a linker polypeptide had been predicted well before the crystal structure of αppGalNAc-T was available [28]. However, its structural relationship with the β4Gal-T1 was first shown by Kubota et al. [29] who determined the crystal structure of an αppGalNAc-T10•Mn2+•UDP-GalNAc complex, which showed that the binding of UDP-GalNAc to αppGalNAc-T10 molecules was similar to UDP-GalNAc binding to β4Gal-T1 enzyme [29]. The crystal structure studies on αppGalNAc-T2 revealed that upon the binding of manganese and the donor sugar substrate, the enzyme undergoes conformational changes involving separate short and long flexible loops, similar to the β4Gal-T1 enzyme (Figure 3a and b) [30]. Interestingly, in the short loop of these proteins, the side chain of a Trp residue undergoes conformational changes from outside to inside of the the catalytic pocket allowing it to interact with the β-phosphate oxygen atom of the bound UDP-sugar substrate molecule. The superposition of the crystal structures of the bovine β4Gal-T1 and the catalytic domain of αppGalNAc-T10 shows similarity in their crystal structures, protein sequences, and gene structures (Figure 3e and f). Interestingly, the Tyr289 residue that determines the donor sugar specificity of the bovine β4Gal-T1 is present as Ala in the αppGalNAc-Ts. Therefore, the catalytic domains of αppGalNAc-T and the vertebrate β4Gal-T1 seem to be related. Since vertebrate β4Gal-T1 emerged from the invertebrate β4GalNAc-T, the catalytic domain of the αppGalNAc-T and the invertebrate β4GalNAc-T might have evolved from a common primordial glycosyltransferase; and during the evolution the αppGalNAc-T acquired the lectin domain (Figure 2). Based on their DNA sequences, this gene duplication and divergence was predicted to have occurred 1.3 billion years ago [2].The crystal structure of the bovine β4Gal-T1 in the open (a) and closed (b) conformation. Upon the binding of manganese and UDP-Gal, the enzyme undergoes conformational changes involving a short and a long flexible loop. In the short loop, the side chain of the Trp314 residue moves from outside to inside the catalytic pocket to bind to the bound UDP-Gal molecule, while the long loop moves over the bound UDP-GalNAc molecule to cover it. The crystal structure of the human αppt-GalNAc-T2 is also found in an open (c) and a closed (d) conformation. Similar to β4Gal-T1, upon the binding of manganese and UDP-GalNAc molecule, this enzyme also undergoes conformational changes involving two flexible loops. Also, in the short loop, the Trp342 residue moves from outside to inside the catalytic pocket to bind to the bound UDP-GalNAc molecule, while the long flexible loop covers the bound UDP-GalNAc molecule.. (e) The superposition of the catalytic domains of bovine β4Gal-T1•Mn2+•UDP-Gal complex with the αppGalNAc-T10•Mn2+•UDP-GalNAc complex and (f) the corresponding protein sequence comparison. The Trp residue in the short flexible loops of these structures show good agreement, and the long flexible loop of β4Gal-T1 and αpptGalNAc-T10 are shown in blue and yellow, respectively. The Tyr289 residue in the bovine β4Gal-T that determines the donor sugar specificity is naturally present as Ala318 residue in αppGalNAc-T10 in order to accommodate the N-acetyl moiety of the donor sugar GalNAc, and it is conserved in all αppGalNAc-T enzymes. In the protein-protein sequence comparison (f), the amino acids are colored, based on their exons. Since the acceptor substrate for β4GalNAc-T1 is a sugar residue, while it is a linear peptide with a Thr/Ser amino acid for the αppGalNAc-T10, these enzymes are expected to have different acceptor binding sites. The additional amino acids in the exons 3 and 4 of αppGalNAc-T10 are found as a part of the acceptor substrate binding site in the αppGalNAc-T10 crystal structure.An additional protein domain, as either a contiguous or a non-contiguous polypeptide, has been observed in many other glycosyltransferases, and such domains have been defined as “add-on” domains [31,32]. For example, in the lactose synthase complex, α-LA alters the acceptor sugar specificity of β4Gal-T1 to Glc, thus acting as a non-contiguous “add-on” domain, similar to the lectin domain in the αppGalNAc-Ts (Figure 4). Recently, the crystal structure of α1,6-fucosyltransferase-8 revealed that this enzyme also has at its C-terminal end a SH3-like “add-on” domain that is usually found in proteins that interact with other proteins and mediate assembly of specific protein complexes, typically via binding to proline-rich peptides in their respective binding partner [31]. Interestingly, the N-terminal tandem-repeat, an “add-on” domain in O-βGlcNAc-T, is known to impart acceptor substrate specificity of the enzyme [33]. Thus, it seems that during evolution these enzymes have acquired these “add-on” domains to impart new functions [32].In the lactose synthase complex (left), α-LA modulates the sugar acceptor specificity of the β4Gal-T1 enzyme from GlcNAc to Glc, while in the αpptGalNAc-Ts (right), although the catalytic domain alone exhibits catalytic activity, the lectin domain defines acceptor substrate specificity to the enzyme. Thus, in these proteins α-LA and the lectin domain are considered as “add-on” domains. There are many other transferases found where such a domain brings about substrate specificity to the enzyme.In all vertebrates, the β1,4-galactosyltransferase family has seven members, β4Gal-T1 to -T7, and they all transfer Gal from UDP-Gal to different acceptor sugar substrates [4]. Interestingly, β4Gal-T7 differs from the rest by its gene structure [34]. However, all the known β4Gal-T7 protein homologs in invertebrates and vertebrates have the conserved Phe/Tyr residue as in β4Gal-T1 [34, 36–40]. The β4Gal-T7 is involved in the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide linker sequence of proteoglycans for heparin/heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate or dermatan sulfates, which are widely found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix of various tissues and are known to play important roles in several cellular functions. β4Gal-T7 is an important enzyme for the species viability [38]; mutation in the human β4Gal-T7 gene has been linked to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [41,42]. Although recent crystal structure of the Drosophila β4Gal-T7 shows that the overall structure of this enzyme is similar to β4Gal-T1, with a similar catalytic pocket, its evolutionary relationship with β4Gal-T1 is still not clear [43].Though high protein sequence similarity between the vertebrate β4Gal-T1 and invertebrate β4GalNAc-T enzymes suggests that these proteins are related by evolution, the difference in their donor sugar specificity is mainly due to a single amino acid change. Furthermore, superposition of the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of β4Gal-T1 with the corresponding catalytic domain of ppGalNAc-T reveals a similarity in their protein sequence and gene structure, suggesting that these proteins are also evolutionarily related. In addition to protein sequence and structure similarity in their gene structure, exon/intron organization is also observed among the proteins that have been thought to have evolved from a common primordial gene. This is in contrast to the observation of a common structural motif among the glycosyltransferases that have DxD metal binding motif and use UDP-sugar as donor substrates without any similarity in their gene structure. Thus, the structural and functional studies of these enzymes have provided deeper insight into the evolution of these glycosyltransferases.We thank Dr. Nathan Sharon from Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, for encouraging us to write this review and for his valuable comments on the manuscript.

PMC2974821,Thioesterases: A new perspective based on their primary and tertiary structures,False,"Thioesterases (TEs) are classified into EC 3.1.2.1 through EC 3.1.2.27 based on their activities on different substrates, with many remaining unclassified (EC 3.1.2.–). Analysis of primary and tertiary structures of known TEs casts a new light on this enzyme group. We used strong primary sequence conservation based on experimentally proved proteins as the main criterion, followed by verification with tertiary structure superpositions, mechanisms, and catalytic residue positions, to accurately define TE families. At present, TEs fall into 23 families almost completely unrelated to each other by primary structure. It is assumed that all members of the same family have essentially the same tertiary structure; however, TEs in different families can have markedly different folds and mechanisms. Conversely, the latter sometimes have very similar tertiary structures and catalytic mechanisms despite being only slightly or not at all related by primary structure, indicating that they have common distant ancestors and can be grouped into clans. At present, four clans encompass 12 TE families. The new constantly updated ThYme (Thioester-active enzYmes) database contains TE primary and tertiary structures, classified into families and clans that are different from those currently found in the literature or in other databases. We review all types of TEs, including those cleaving CoA, ACP, glutathione, and other protein molecules, and we discuss their structures, functions, and mechanisms.The thioesterases (TEs), or thioester hydrolases, comprise a large enzyme group whose members hydrolyze the thioester bond between a carbonyl group and a sulfur atom. They are classified by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB) into EC (enzyme commission) 3.1.2.1 to EC 3.1.2.27, as well as EC 3.1.2.– for unclassified TEs.1 Substrates of 15 of these 27 groupings contain coenzyme A (CoA), two contain acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), four have glutathione or its derivatives, one has ubiquitin, and two contain other moieties. In addition, three groupings have been deleted.The EC classification system is based on enzyme function and substrate identity, and it was first formulated when very few amino acid sequences (primary structures) and three-dimensional (tertiary) structures of enzymes were available. Another way to classify enzymes is by primary structure into families and by tertiary structure into clans or superfamilies. Some databases are built this way: Pfam2 has a collection of protein families and domains, and SCOP3 classifies protein structures into classes, folds, families, and superfamilies. Other databases treat certain enzyme groups more specifically. For instance, MEROPS4 is a major database for peptidases, and CAZy5 covers carbohydrate-active enzymes.It is common to observe that members of more than one EC grouping are found in one enzyme family based on similar amino acid sequences, implying that they have a common ancestor, mechanism, and tertiary structure. Conversely, members of a single EC grouping may be located in more than one enzyme family, being totally or almost totally unrelated in primary structure and potentially in mechanism and tertiary structure.A further observation is that members of two different enzyme families may have very similar tertiary structures and mechanisms even though their primary structures are very different. This may imply that they are members of the same clan or superfamily, descended from a more distant common ancestor.In this work, TE primary and tertiary structures will be analyzed to conclude how TEs are divided (and united) into families and clans. Structures, mechanisms, and catalytic residues are compared between families and clans. We compare our findings with existing databases such as Pfam and SCOP. Results also appear in a new continuously updated database, ThYme (Thioester-active enzYmes, http://www.enzyme.cbirc.iastate.edu) that includes families and clans of enzyme groups that are part of the fatty acid synthesis cycle, TEs among them.Family members must have strong (>15%, but typically >30%) sequence similarity and near-identical tertiary structures, and they must share general mechanisms as well as catalytic residues located in the same position.In general, TE families were identified in the following way: (1) experimentally confirmed TE sequences were used as queries, (2) a series of successive Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)6 searches and comparison among results reduced query sequences to a few representative ones, (3) the catalytic domains of representative query sequences were subjected to BLAST to populate the families, (4) experimentally confirmed TEs were surveyed to search for missing potential TE families, and (5) the uniqueness of the families was confirmed by multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), by tertiary structure superposition and comparison, and by catalytic residue positions. Methods are detailed in Supporting Information.Two or more families are grouped into a clan if all the sequences within them show some (<15%) sequence similarity, if their structures are strongly similar (narrowing the search to families with the same fold), and if they share similar active sites and general mechanisms. To consider all aspects of clan classification criteria, several methods are used to combine sequence and structural analysis. In addition, catalytic mechanisms of members of each family were gathered from the literature, and positions of catalytic residues were determined to verify that they coincided. A more detailed description of these methods is found in the Supporting Information.All the sequences in each family are displayed on the ThYme database website (http://www.enzyme.cbirc.iastate.edu). These sequences are taken, using a series of scripts, from the BLAST results of the catalytic domains of the representative query sequences. Matching accessions, taxonomical data, protein names, and EC numbers are taken from UniProt7 and GenBank8 databases. Each TE family is shown on a page where sequences are arranged into archaea, bacteria, and eukaryota, then alphabetically by species. In each row, a single sequence or group of sequences with 100% identical catalytic domains are shown with their protein name and UniProt and/or GenBank accession codes. EC numbers are shown only when they appear in a sequence's UniProt or GenBank annotation. If a crystal structure is known, the Protein Data Bank (PDB, http://www.rcsb.org) accession code also appears. ThYme will be continuously updated: the content of each family will grow as GenBank, UniProt, and PDB do. However, to create a new family, or to merge or delete existing ones, human judgment and manual changes will be necessary.Use of BLAST with TE query sequences followed by construction of MSAs and superposition of tertiary structures yielded 23 families almost completely unrelated by primary structure (Table I).Thioesterase Families and Common Names of their MembersEnzymes in families TE1–TE13 hydrolyze substrates with various acyl moieties and CoA, those in TE14–TE19 attack bonds between acyl groups and ACP, and those in TE20 and TE21 cleave the bonds between acyl groups and proteins. Members of TE22 and TE23 break bonds between acyl groups and glutathione and its derivatives (Table II). The sulfur-carrying moiety in CoA and ACP is a pantethiene residue, whereas glutathione itself carries the sulfur moiety, and in non-ACP proteins, the sulfur-carrying moiety is built up mainly from a cysteine residue.Thioesterase Functions and Substrate SpecificitiesAll tertiary structures within each family have almost identical cores and very strong overall resemblance (Table III) shown by RMSDave values of <1.8 Å and Pave values of >75% (see Supporting Information for definitions), with two exceptions. TE4 has a Pave value of 33.3% because it has only two crystal structures, of which one monomer (1C8U) is a double HotDog, whereas another monomer (1TBU) is incomplete with only a single HotDog. Similarly, in TE16 the Pave value is 65.8% because the TE domain of one structure (2VSQ) is smaller than the rest.Thioesterase FoldsOf the families whose members hydrolyze acyl-CoAs, all have HotDog9,10 folds (Table III, Figs. 1 and ​and2)2) except for TE1, TE2, and TE3. TE1 enzymes have NagB folds, and they have acetyl-CoA hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.1) activity as well as acetate or succinate-CoA transferase (EC 2.8.3.–) activity. They are found mainly in bacteria and fungi, although they are also present in archaea. Enzymes coded by the acetyl-CoA hydrolase ACH1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae are present in TE1.11 Fungal enzymes in this family are involved with acetate levels and CoA transfer in mitochondria.12Superimposed tertiary structures of single representatives of each TE family in a clan: TE-A acyl-CoA hydrolases from Escherichia coli (TE5) (green), Helicobacter pylori (TE9) (red), Pseudomonas sp. (TE10) (yellow), and Prochlorococcus marinus (TE12) (blue).Superimposed tertiary structures of single representatives of each TE family in a clan: TE-B acyl-CoA hydrolases from Homo sapiens (TE8) (blue), Arthrobacter sp. (TE11) (red), and E. coli (TE13) (yellow).TE2 enzymes have α/β-hydrolase13 folds (Figs. 3 and ​and4).4). They are mainly found in eukaryotes (animals), but they are also present in bacteria. They have mostly palmitoyl (EC 3.1.2.2) and bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyl transferase (BAT) (EC 2.3.1.65) activities. The acyl-CoA TE (Acot) enzymes ACOT1, ACOT2, ACOT4, and ACOT6 from Homo sapiens are present in this family, as well as the Acot1 through Acot6 enzymes from Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and similar species.14 Also in TE2 are the BAAT TEs that transfer bile acid from bile acid-CoA to amino acids in the liver; these conjugates later solvate fatty acids in the gastrointestinal tract.15Superimposed tertiary structures of single representatives of each TE family in a clan: TE-C acyl-ACP hydrolases from Homo sapiens (TE16) (blue), Saccharopolyspora erythraea (TE17) (red), and Amycolatopsis mediterranei (TE18) (yellow).Superimposed tertiary structures of single representatives of each TE family in a clan: TE-D protein-acyl hydrolases from Bos taurus (TE20) (blue) and Homo sapiens (TE21) (yellow).Enzymes in TE3 are part of the SGNH hydrolase superfamily with a flavodoxin-like fold. They are mainly found in bacteria and have acyl-CoA hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.20), arylesterase (EC 3.1.1.2), and lysophospholipase (EC 3.1.1.5) activities. Some TE3 enzymes come from the tesA gene, and they are located in the periplasm and are involved in fatty acid synthesis.16 TE3 enzymes are also called acyl-CoA thioesterase I, protease I, and lysophospholipase L1, and the genes that code for them, tesA, apeA, and pldC, respectively, are nearly identical.17The rest of the acyl-CoA hydrolase families have HotDog folds. TE4 enzymes, present in bacteria and eukaryotes, are acyl-CoA hydrolases as well as palmitoyl-CoA (EC 3.1.2.2) and choloyl-CoA (EC 3.1.2.27) hydrolases. The Acot8 gene encodes for peroxisomal TEs,18 which are found in TE4. Also in this family are acyl-CoA thioesterase II enzymes, encoded by the tesB gene, that can hydrolyze a broad range of medium- to long-chain acyl-CoA thioesters, but whose physiological function is not known.19TE5 acyl-CoA enzymes, also known as thioesterase IIIs, are present in bacteria. They are encoded by the tesC (or ybaW) gene and are long-chain acyl-CoA TEs preferring 3,5-tetradecadienoyl-CoA as a substrate.20TE6 members, present in eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea, hav e acyl-CoA hydrolase activities with various specificities. Acot enzymes 7, 11, and 12, present in eukaryotes, are found in TE6. Acot7 enzymes (also known as BACH: brain acyl-CoA hydrolases) are expressed mainly in brain tissue and preferentially attack C8–C18 acyl-CoA chains.21 Acot11 (also known as BFIT: brown fat inducible TE, or Them1: TE superfamily member 1) enzymes are specific toward medium- and long-chain acyl-CoA molecules, and they may be involved with obesity in humans.22 Acot12 (also known as CACH: cytoplasmic acyl-CoA hydrolase) enzymes in humans hydrolyze acetyl-CoA.23 Many bacterial TE6 sequences are YciA TEs that hydrolyze a wide range of acyl-CoA thioesters and may help to form membranes.24 They preferentially attack butyryl, hexanoyl, lauroyl, and palmitoyl-CoA substrates.25TE7 enzymes are acyl-CoA TEs found in eukaryota and bacteria. In this family are the Acot9 and Acot10 enzymes (previously known as MT-ACT48), which are expressed in the mitochondria and have short- to long-chain acyl-CoA TE activity, showing preference for C14 chains.26Most TE8 members, mainly present in eukaryota but also in bacteria, are acyl-CoA thioesterase 13 (Acot13) enzymes, also known as TE superfamily member 2 (Them2). Enzymes in this family hydrolyze short-to-long acyl-CoA (C4–C18) chains, preferring the latter.27TE9 members are found only in bacteria, and they have acyl-CoA hydrolase activity, mostly unclassified (3.1.2.–), but ADP-dependent short-chain acyl-CoA hydrolases (EC 3.1.2.18), and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA hydrolases (EC 3.1.2.23) are also found. The YbgC TEs are found in this family; some hydrolyze primarily short-chain acyl-CoA thioesters,28 whereas others prefer long-chain acyl-CoA thioesters.29 Also, the TE domain of methylketone synthase, MKS2, recently discovered in tomato, is found in TE9.30The enzymes in TE10 and TE11 are found only in bacteria, and most have 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.23) activity. They, along with other enzymes, convert 4-chlorobenzoate to 4-hydroxybenzoate in soil-dwelling bacteria.31 Also in TE11 are the EntH (YbdB) TEs, involved with enterobactin (an iron chelator) biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.32 This is a unique example of a HotDog-fold enzyme involved in nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis.Most TE12 enzymes are 1,4-dihydroxy-2-napthoyl (DNHA)-CoA hydrolases, involved in vitamin K1 biosynthesis,33 and they are found mostly in bacteria. TE13 enzymes occur in archaea and bacteria. Most are either PaaI or PaaD enzymes in the phenylacetic acid degradation pathway, and they are part of the paa gene cluster.34TE14–TE19 enzymes hydrolyze acyl-ACP thioesters, with those in TE14 and TE15 having HotDog folds, whereas the rest have α/β-hydrolase folds. TE14 enzymes are found in bacteria and plants; they have acyl-ACP hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.14) activity. Many plant enzymes in this family have been experimentally characterized: they contain FatA and FatB enzymes and can hydrolyze C8–C18 acyl-ACP thioesters.35 All TE14 bacterial sequences come from genomic or structural genomic studies.TE15 is a small family whose enzymes are present mainly in bacteria. Among them is the TE CalE7 involved with enediyne biosynthesis. After substrate-ACP hydrolysis, these enzymes decarboxylate the product before release.36 Enzymes in this family are the few TEs with HotDog domains involved with polyketide biosynthesis.TE16 enzymes occur in both eukaryotes and bacteria, and they have oleoyl-ACP hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.14) activity. They include the TE domains of fatty acid synthases (FASs), also known as Thioesterase I, that terminate fatty acid synthesis,37 and the TE domain of polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthases (NRPs), also known as Type I thioesterases (TE I), that terminate polyketide biosynthesis,38 or nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis.39 In the case of NRPs, instead of an ACP as the carrier molecule, a polypeptide carrier protein (PCP) is used.TE17 enzymes are only found in bacteria, mainly in Streptomyces. They are the TE domains of various PKSs. FASs, PKSs, and NRPs are large multimodular enzymes with many domains having different functions. Only the TE domains were used to identify these family members.Enzymes in TE18 are present in eukaryotes and bacteria and mainly have oleoyl-ACP hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.14) activity. Some enzymes in this family are S-acyl fatty acid synthetases/thioester hydrolases (Thioesterase II).40 They work with FASs to produce medium-chain (C8–C12) fatty acids in milk.41 The Type II thioesterases (TE IIs) are found in TE18; these enzymes play an important role in polyketide and nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis by removing aberrant acyl chains from multimodular polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthases.42,43 TE18 enzymes are independent TEs, not integrated to the multimodular FASs, PKSs, or NRPs.TE19 enzymes are classified as acyltransferases (EC 2.3.1.–), but they hydrolyze acyl-ACP molecules, mainly myristoyl-ACP.44 These enzymes divert fatty acids to the luminescent system in certain bacteria.TE20 members, found only in eukaryotes, are palmitoyl-protein TEs (EC 3.1.2.22) encoded by PPT genes. They hydrolyze the thioester bond between a palmitoyl group and a cysteine residue in proteins.45 Mutations in PPT enzymes have been linked to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a genetic neurodegenerative disorder.46TE21 enzymes were originally identified as lysophospholipases,47 but they are also acyl-protein APT1 TEs.48 They hydrolyze thioester bonds between acyl chains and cysteine residues on proteins. Many proteins in this family also have carboxyesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) activity.Among TE22 enzymes are S-formylglutathione hydrolases (EC 3.1.2.12) catalyzing formaldehyde detoxification; they hydrolyze S-formylglutathione into formate and glutathione.49 Also in TE22 are enzymes with acetyl esterase (EC 3.1.1.6) and carboxyesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) activity.TE23 members are hydroxyglutathione hydrolases (EC 3.1.2.6), also known as glyoxalase II enzymes, that hydrolyze S-d-lactoyl-glutathione to glutathione and lactic acid in methylglyoxal detoxification.50 TE23 enzymes occur in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes and have a metallo-β-lactamase fold.51These TE families bear rather limited resemblance to EC numbers representing TEs. For instance, acetyl-CoA hydrolases (3.1.2.1) occur in TE1, TE6, and TE7; palmitoyl-CoA hydrolases (EC 3.1.2.2) are found in TE2, TE4, TE6, and TE7; oleoyl-ACP hydrolases (EC 3.1.2.14) occur in TE14 and TE16–TE18, and acyl-CoA hydrolases (EC 3.1.2.20) are found in TE3, TE6, and TE7. Conversely, of the 24 EC numbers remaining after three deletions, only 11 of them (EC 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.6, 3.1.2.12, 3.1.2.14, 3.2.1.18, 3.1.2.19, 3.1.2.20, 3.1.2.22, 3.1.2.23, and 3.1.2.27, along with unclassified TEs (EC 3.1.2.–)) occur in significant numbers among the 23 TE families. Of course, further EC numbers characteristic of TEs will likely appear as more TEs are sequenced and characterized.Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolases (EC 3.1.2.15) cleave a wide variety of products from the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin. They were first identified as thiolesterases because they cleave dithiothreitol from ubiquitin, and they were thought to also hydrolyze ubiquitin-glutathione and other ubiquitin thiolesters.52 It was later shown that they hydrolyze amides and other groups from ubiquitin.53 These enzymes belong to a larger class of peptidases called deubiquitinating enzymes that hydrolyze lysine-glycine amide bonds in ubiquitinated proteins.54 Several families of these enzymes can be found in MEROPS, the peptidase database. We identified 11 ubiquitin thiolesterase families by the methods described above, but we have not included them here or in the ThYme database, as peptidase activity is their main function, and they can be found in MEROPS.Certain acyl transferases (EC 2.3.1.–), for example, 2.3.1.9, 2.3.1.16, 2.3.1.38, and 2.3.1.39 among others, can hydrolyze acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP substrates and later join the liberated acyl group to another acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP molecule. Although they hydrolyze thioesters, this is not their main function, and therefore, we also decided not to include these enzymes here.TE families 4–6 and 8–15, all with members having HotDog crystal structures, were subjected to the methods described above and two clans were found: TE-A comprising families TE5, TE9, TE10, and TE12; and TE-B with TE8, TE11, and TE13.PSI–BLAST6 analysis suggested that TE5, TE9, TE10, and TE12 should be grouped into one clan and TE8, TE11, and TE13 into another, because slight sequence similarities among these families were found. Secondary structure element analysis of the structures pointed to TE5, TE6, TE10, TE12, and TE15 (having five β-strands) being placed in one clan and TE8, TE11, and TE13 (having six β-strands) being placed in another (Table IV); visual inspection suggested the same two groupings, with the first also including TE9. All crystal structures in candidate families of both possible clans were tested with superpositions and RMSD analysis (Figs. 1 and ​and2,2, Table V). These different tests led to the two clans being defined. Members of TE-A are all acyl-CoA hydrolases active on many substrates including short, long, branched, and aromatic acyl chains. Catalytic residues (see below) in TE6 are placed differently than those of other TE-A families, and therefore, TE6 was not included in this clan. The different substrate specificities, catalytic residues, and mechanism (see below) of TE15 members suggested that it also be excluded from TE-A. TE-B enzymes are also acyl-CoA hydrolases, except for the YbdB TEs in TE11 involved with enterobactin biosynthesis. TE4, TE7 (which has no known tertiary structure), and TE14 enzymes are sufficiently different from members of TE-A and TE-B that they were not considered for placement in either clan; the first 2 are acyl-CoA hydrolases, whereas the third is an acyl-ACP hydrolase.Thioesterase Core Secondary Structure ElementsRMSD Analysis of TE Clan MembersTE families 2 and 16 through 22, whose members all have α/β-hydrolase crystal structures, belong to two clans: TE-C comprising TE16, TE17, and TE18, and TE-D with TE20 and TE21.Both sequence analysis and secondary structure element arrangement suggested only one clan of TE16, TE17, and TE18 (Table IV). Visual inspection suggested the two clans described above, and they were confirmed by superpositions, RMSD analysis, and the position of catalytic residues (Figs. 3 and ​and4,4, Table V). Families in TE-C contain acyl-ACP hydrolases present in multidomain FASs, PKSs, and NRPs, as well as independent acyl-ACP TEs involved in those pathways. TE-D enzymes hydrolyze palmitoyl and other acyl groups from protein surfaces. TE2, an acyl-CoA hydrolase, TE19, a myristoyl-ACP hydrolase, and TE22, active on glutathione-activated molecules, are not part of either clan.Catalytic mechanisms and residues of each TE family were gathered from crystal structure articles. The PDB files, proposed catalytic residues, and producing organisms of the relevant TEs are listed in Table VI.TE Family and Clan MechanismsHotDog-fold enzymes lack defined nonsolvated binding pockets and conserved catalytic residues,24 thus a variety of catalytic residues and mechanisms exist.In TE-A, only TE9 and TE10 can be further analyzed, as TE5 and TE12 at present have only one crystal structure each with no corresponding refereed article. In TE9, the YbgC structure 2PZH is a tetramer of two dimers. After comparing this structure to 1LO9 in TE10 and other YbgC crystals, the authors proposed that His18, Tyr7, and Asp11 play important roles in catalysis.29TE10 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA TEs have homotetrameric quaternary structures. It was suggested from structures 1LO7, 1LO8, and 1LO9 that hydrogen bonds and the positive end of a helix dipole moment make the thioester carbonyl group more susceptible to a nucleophilic attack by Asp17 through an acyl-enzyme intermediate.55TE-B families include TE8, TE11, and TE13. Members of TE8 are tetramers composed of two HotDog dimers. Based on a crystal structure of a human Them2 enzyme (3F5O), it was proposed that Gly57 and Asn50 bind and polarize the thioester carbonyl group, whereas Asp65 and Ser85 orient and activate the water nucleophile.56In TE11, Arthrobacter sp. strain SU 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA TE crystal structures reveal a tetrameric enzyme with a dimer of dimers. Structures 1Q4S, 1Q4T, and 1Q4U led to the proposal that Gly65 polarizes the carbonyl group for a nucleophilic attack carried out by Glu73.57Both TE10 and TE11 are 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA TEs of similar substrate specificities and metabolic functions; however, their tertiary and quaternary structures are different and they use different active-site regions and residues for catalysis. This supports placing these two families in two different clans.TE13 PaaI TE from Thermusthermophilus HB8 yielded homotetrameric quaternary structures 1WLU, 1J1Y, 1WM6, 1WLV, and 1WN3. From those structures, a study proposed that these enzymes use an induced-fit mechanism to hydrolyze the substrate via an Asp48-activated water nucleophile.58 Comparison of the structure of another PaaI, from E. coli (2FS2) with the Arthrobacter TE11 structures, as well as site-directed mutagenesis, pointed to a mechanism similar to that in TE11: Gly53 prepares the thioester for a nucleophilic attack from Asp61.59 4-Hydrozybenzoyl-CoA enzymes from TE11 and the PaaI enzymes from TE13 catalyze two different reactions in different organisms, and their primary sequences are not related; yet their tertiary structures, catalytic residues, and mechanisms are similar, supporting the conclusion that both TE11 and TE13 are part of TE-B.Of TE families with HotDog structures not placed in clans, TE4 catalytic residues and mechanisms have been identified based on structure 1C8U and site-directed mutagenesis: an Asp204–Gln278–Thr228 triad orients a water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the substrate.60 The double HotDog structure of 1C8U and its catalytic residues and mechanism differ from other HotDog enzymes, supporting the exclusion of TE4 from TE-A and TE-B.In TE6, Acot7 structure 2Q2B is a trimer of HotDog dimers; both domains are required for activity and Asn24 from the N-domain and Asp213 from the C-domain have been identified as catalytic residues through site-directed mutagenesis.61 Also in TE6, YciA structures 1YLI and 3D6L have a trimer of dimers with two binding sites across the dimer interface. A D44A mutation (3BJK) of 1YLI eliminated activity.62The two known tertiary structures in TE14 come from structural genomic studies and do not have supporting literature. However, based on a bioinformatics-guided site-directed mutagenesis study on a FatB enzyme from Arabidopsis, a study proposed that Cys264, His229, and Asn227 make up a papain-like catalytic triad.63Structure 2W3X of TE15 CalE7 has no acidic residues in the catalytic region. Based on site-directed mutagenesis, a mechanism different from other HotDogs was proposed: Asn19 and Arg37 anchor the substrate with hydrogen bonds, whereas a water molecule or hydroxide anion acts as a nucleophile, attacking the substrate carbonyl group. Arg37 also acts as an oxyanion hole to stabilize the intermediate, and Tyr29 facilitates decarboxylation following hydrolysis.36Unlike HotDogs, α/β hydrolases have very conserved catalytic residues: a nucleophile–histidine–acid triad.13 The nucleophile can be serine, cysteine, or aspartate; the histidine is always conserved, and the third residue is always acidic. Fold architecture, substrate specificities, and binding sites vary within this fold.64 Generally, the acid stabilizes a histidine residue that acts as a base, accepting a proton from the nucleophile that forms an intermediate with the substrate, which is then attacked by water. In some PKSs and NRPs that make cyclic products, a hydroxyl group from the substrate chain is used for lactonization instead of a water molecule.TE-C encompasses TE16, TE17, and TE18. Members of all three families have the same Ser–His–Asp triad. The position of the acid residue differs from what is usually found in α/β hydrolases, as was seen in human FAS TE domain 1XKT.65 In TE17, a substrate channel was found in the TE domain of 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS-TE) from Saccharopolyspora erythraea (1KEZ), unique among TE α/β hydrolases.66 The substrate channel depends on pH and supports the prediction that all macrocycle-forming TEs from PKSs have a similar catalytic mechanism. Many macrocycle-forming TE domains from PKSs were found in TE17, again supporting this prediction.Members of the two families, TE20 and TE21, in TE-D also have Ser–His–Asp catalytic triads. TE21 structure 1AUO confirmed that some bacterial carboxylesterases with broad substrate specificity have an α/β hydrolase fold.67 These enzyme structures are very similar to the mainly eukaryotic acyl-protein hydrolases, even though they have very different specificities.TE2, TE19, and TE22 are other α/β hydrolases that are not part of any clan, but they still maintain the characteristic catalytic triad.TEs are found in NagB (TE1), SGNH (TE3), and lactamase (TE23) folds. TE1 has two structures with no refereed literature, so their mechanism and catalytic residues remain unknown.From TE3 structures 1IVN, 1JRL, and 1J00, the existence of a Ser–His–Asp catalytic triad similar to those in the TE α/β hydrolases was proposed.68 The later crystal structures 1U8U and 1V2G suggested that a conformational change, described as a switch loop movement, occurs during catalysis.69Because TE23 hydroxyglutathione hydrolases (glyoxalase IIs) have metallo-β-lactamase folds, their mechanisms are very different from the rest of TEs that do not have catalytic metal ions. Two crystal structures, 1QH3 and 1QH5, have seven His and Asp residues and a water molecule interacting with two zinc ions. Based on this, a study proposed that a hydroxide ion bonded with both ions attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the glutathione thioester substrate, forming a tetrahedral intermediate, followed by breakage of the C–S bond.70Some TE tertiary structures, including all those in TE1, TE5, TE12, and TE14, are not supplemented by refereed literature. Furthermore, TE7 does not have a known tertiary structure. Therefore, the catalytic residues and mechanisms for TEs in these families are not securely known.Because the positions of catalytic residues must be conserved within families and clans, unknown identities of catalytic residues in TEs can be predicted by viewing the positions of the catalytic residues in all superimposed structures in a family or clan.In TE2, we predict that in the human ACOT4 structure 3K2I the catalytic triad is Ser232–His360–Asp326, based on the human ACOT2 structure 3HLK. In TE6, based on structures from mouse Acot7 (2Q2B), Haemophilus influenzae YciA (3BJK), and Campylobacter jejuni (3D6L), Asp245 in human ACOT7, and Asp36 in human ACOT12 appear to be catalytic residues. In TE8, study of the structures of human Them2 (3F5O and 2F0X) leads to the prediction that human TE structure 2H4U and mouse TE structure 2CY9 have the same catalytic residues: Asn50, Asp65, Ser83, and Gly57. In TE9, based on Helicobacter pylori YbgC enzyme 2PZH, we predict that, in E. coli 1S5U, the catalytic residues are Tyr14, Asp18, and His25, in Bartonella henselae 3HM0, they are Tyr23, Asp28, and His35, and, in T. thermophilus, they are 1Z54 Tyr11, Asp15, and His22. All three residues in the three structures superimposed very closely and in the same position except for Tyr35 in 3HM0, where the ring is facing in another direction and the residue is one amino acid position displaced. This might lead to a difference in enzyme substrate specificity. In TE11, based on TE structures 1Q4S, 1Q4T, and 1Q4U from Arthrobacter sp., we predict that the catalytic residues are Gly55 and Glu63 in both structure 1VH9 of the putative TE from E. coli and in structures 2B6E, 1SC0, and 3LZ7 of a hypothetical H. influenzae TE. In TE13, E. coli structure 1PSU shares the same Gly53 and Asp61 catalytic residues with E. coli PaaI 2FS2, and T. thermophilus 2DSL shares the same Gly40 and Asp48 catalytic residues with the other T. thermophilus PaaI structures 1J1Y, 1WLU, 1WLV, 1WM6, 1WN3.Comparing TE20 bovine PPT1 (1EI9) and human PPT2 (1PJA) suggests that human PPT1 structure 3GRO has the catalytic triad Ser115–His289–Asp233, the same residues as the bovine PPT1. In TE21, Pseudomonas fluorescens carboxylesterases 1AUO and 1AUR, and human acyl-protein TE 1FJ2 lead to predicting that the catalytic residues in Pseudomonas aeruginosa structures 3CN7 and 3CN9 should be Ser113, His197, and Asp166. In TE22, esterase A 2UZ0, S-formylglutathione hydrolase 1PV1, human esterase D 3FCX, and a putative enzyme (3E4D), suggest that, in Oleispira antartica esterase 3I6Y, the catalytic triad is Ser148–His257–Asp224.Within TE-A, two families, TE5 and TE12, only have one crystal structure each (1NJK and 2HX5, respectively) with no supporting refereed article. Superimposition of structures within TE-A lead us to predict that the catalytic residue in TE5 YbaW probable enzyme is Asp13, whereas, in TE12 putative TEs (2HX5), the catalytic residue is Asp19.These results show the effects of both convergent and divergent evolution. The former is exemplified by the fact that members in TE families from different clans and/or folds, descended from different ancestors, are active on substrates, many of them the same and all containing the thioester group, attacking the bond between its carbonyl carbon atom and its adjacent sulfur atom. Divergent evolution is shown by the presence in many TE families of enzymes with separate names and EC numbers (beyond the undifferentiated number EC 3.1.2.–), signifying activities on different substrates, even though they have similar primary and tertiary structures and mechanisms. A more profound indication of divergent evolution is the presence of clans containing families with very different primary structures but common tertiary structures and mechanisms.Some TEs have been previously classified by sequence or structure in different databases. The subjective boundaries between subfamilies, families, and clans or superfamilies, as well as the use of different methodologies, give rise to differences among databases. A summary of these differences can be found on Table VII.Comparison of Family and Clan NomenclatureThe SCOP classification system3 is based on protein structure, and the SCOP database was assembled mainly by visual inspection and comparison, with some automation. We used it to search for the structures of TE family members. Our classes and folds correspond with SCOP; however, some differences arise at the superfamily and family levels. For example, structures in TE2, TE4, TE15, and TE18 are not classified, nor are those in TE7, which does not have a known structure. Some of our clans correspond to SCOP families: TE-B corresponds to the PaaI/YdiI-like SCOP family, and TE-A is somewhat similar to the 4HBT-like SCOP family.Pfam has identified and classified many protein families. Pfam-A is manually curated and its families are identified with hidden Markov model profiles built from carefully chosen seed multiple alignments.71 The main difference in methodology is that in Pfam, sequences that fit a profile from a seed alignment are part of a family, whereas in ThYme sequences strongly similar to a query sequence that has TE function and evidence at protein level are part of a TE family. This leads to differences in the families: Pfam families are more inclusive and cover a wider range of sequences, whereas ThYme families are smaller, with all sequences having a very strong sequence similarity. For example, Pfam-A family 4HBT includes our families TE5–TE13 and TE15. We have shown that these families have varied structures and overall functions, as well as different mechanisms and catalytic residues. Furthermore, some of these ThYme families appear in two clans, TE-A and TE-B, and some are not part of any clan.Dillon and Bateman10 defined subfamilies for the HotDog fold. Among HotDog fold enzymes are TEs, and some of the subfamilies presented correspond with our families. For instance, TE4 corresponds to the TesB-like subfamily, TE5 to the YbaW subfamily, TE6 to the Acyl-CoA thioesterase subfamily, TE9 to the YbgC-like subfamily, TE10 and TE11 to the 4HBT-I and 4HBT-II subfamilies, TE13 to the PaaI subfamily, and TE14 to the Fat subfamily. However, the exact content, sequences, and structures of these subfamilies might not correspond to the corresponding families in ThYme.Two other more specific databases, ESTHER,72 a database for the α/β hydrolase fold, and the Lipase Engineering Database,73 contain some TEs. Both have families that resemble TE19, TE20, and TE21, and ESTHER also has one family similar to TE16. Again, the exact content, sequences, and structures in these families might not correspond to those in ThYme.ThYme has detailed structural and biological annotation for TEs and other thioester-active enzymes. It does not compete with but rather supplements existing databases such as Pfam, as it is focused on thioester-active enzymes in the same way that CAZy is focused on carbohydrate-active enzymes and MEROPS is focused on peptidases. It can accurately point out differences and similarities in structure, mechanisms, and catalytic residues. The differences in methodology and purpose lead to differences with other databases. We follow the SCOP classification system, but differences in the databases arise because SCOP's purpose is to present a tertiary structure classification, whereas ThYme classifies TEs and other thioester-active enzymes mainly by primary structure. Pfam has a wide scope, and it is an extremely useful tool to identify domains within sequences, but it is not specific to a particular enzyme group. Dillon and Bateman's article,10 as well as ESTHER and the Lipase Engineering Database, have different focuses, and their overall contents do not correspond to that in ThYme.Analysis of primary and tertiary structures has led to classifying all TEs into families and clans. Within families, all enzymes share very similar primary and tertiary structures, active sites, catalytic residues, and mechanisms. Within clans, enzymes share some sequence similarity and similar structures, active sites, catalytic residues, and mechanisms. This classification system can help to predict an individual enzyme's structure, function, or mechanism. It also provides a standardized nomenclature.The authors thank Matthew Lemons of the Iowa State University Web Development Services office for his help in developing ThYme.

PMC2975065,"Discoidin I from Dictyostelium discoideum and interactions with oligosaccharides: specificity, affinity, crystal structures and comparison with Discoidin II",False,"Discoidin I and Discoidin II (DiscI and DiscII), are N-acetylgalactosamine-binding proteins from Dictyostelium discoideum. They consist of two domains with an N-terminal discoidin domain and a C-terminal H-type lectin domain. They were cloned and expressed in high yield in recombinant form in Escherichia coli. Although both lectins bind galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, glycan array experiments performed on the recombinant proteins displayed strong differences in their specificity for oligosaccharides. DiscI and DiscII bind preferentially to Gal/GalNAcβ1-3Gal/GalNAc- and Gal/GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-6Gal/GalNAc- containing glycans respectively. The affinity of the interaction of DiscI with monosaccharides and disaccharides was evaluated using isothermal calorimetry experiments. The tree-dimensional structures of native DiscI and its complexes with GalNAc, GalNAcβ1-3Gal and Galβ1-3GalNAc were solved by X-ray crystallography. DiscI forms trimers with involvement of calcium at the monomer interface. The N-terminal discoidin domain presents structural similarity to F-type lectins such as the eel agglutinin where an amphiphilic binding pocket suggests a possible carbohydrate-binding activity. In the C-terminal H-type lectin domain, the GalNAc residue establishes specific hydrogen bonds that explain the observed affinity (Kd = 3 10-4 M). The different specificities of DiscI and DiscII for oligosaccharides were rationalized from the different structures obtained by either X-ray crystallography or molecular modelling.Lectins are defined as ubiquitous proteins of non-immune origin that interact reversibly and specifically with carbohydrates without modifying them. A large panel of lectins has been identified in invertebrates and considerable attention is focused on their roles in biological recognition. Invertebrate lectins are often involved in specific binding to bacterial polysaccharides, playing a role in establishment of symbiosis or innate immunity 1,2,3. In other cases, they are involved in self-recognition and in cell-cell aggregation that are required for the building of multicellular organisms such as corals and sponges.4 They can be useful tools in cancer diagnosis/prognosis as histochemical markers or in cancer therapy thanks to antitumoral activities.5,6,7The slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum grows as free-living amoebae in the soil, feeding on bacteria. Upon starvation, it undergoes a complex developmental cycle in which about 10.000-50.000 individual amoebae aggregate to form a multicellular fruiting body that is able to produce spores. The aggregation of individual amoeba occurs by chemotaxis to periodic cAMP signals (reviewed in8). During differentiation, numerous new proteins are synthesized, and some of the most abundant of these new products are the two N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-binding proteins Discoidin I and II (DiscI and II).9,10 They are virtually undetectable in cells growing on bacteria but constitute over 1% of the cellular proteins in aggregated cells.9 They present overlapping but distinct sugar specificities.10 The production of DiscI is prominent in aggregating cells, which accumulates intracellularly and upon externalisation in multilamellar bodies while DiscII is prominent during fruiting body formation and is localized in the prespore vesicules.11,12 The precise function of these lectins as well as their biological ligands remain unknown.DiscI is polymorphic with at least three isoforms per strain coded by genes forming a small, coordinately regulated multigene family.13,14 The three genes dscA, dscC and dscD are found on chromosome 2 and are duplicated on the same chromosome in some laboratory strains (AX3 and AX4). They are often used as a marker of early development in D. discoideum.15,16 DiscI expression is developmentally-regulated at the transcriptional level by several signal transduction pathways involving cAMP, prestarvation factor (PSF) and conditioned medium factor (CMF).17,18,19 Several mutants and antisense transformants analysis showed that DiscI was apparently not necessary for aggregation since mutants plated at high density can aggregate and form fruiting bodies.17 The lack of gene product impairs the process of cell streaming in early development, where it seems important in the formation of head-to-tail streams by aggregating cells.20 DiscI was also shown to be involved in cell substratum attachment and ordered cell migration during aggregation by a fibronectin-like mechanism.21 It contains the RGD motif, which is the cell attachment site found in large collection of adhesive proteins.22,23 The proposed receptor for this RGD sequence is a developmentally regulated cell-surface glycoprotein of 67 KDa.24 DiscI also recognises glycoconjugates that contain GalNAc in the slime coat around aggregates and in multilamellar bodies since the interaction is completely blocked in the presence of GalNAc.25,26,27 The sugar binding site was shown to be different of the cell adhesion site and requires a divalent cation.24,28DiscI is a two domain protein of 253 amino acids with higher affinity for GalNAc than for galactose (Gal).10 It displays 48% sequence identity with DiscII whose trimeric structure has been recently solved in unliganded state and in complex with Gal and GalNAc.29 The N-terminal domain, referred as the discoidin domain (DS domain), is a structural and functional motif found in various proteins from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic origins. This domain shows considerable functional diversity via interactions with a wide range of molecules and is mainly involved in cell surface mediated regulatory events and glycoconjugates binding.30,31,32 The C-terminal domain belongs to the H-type lectin family recently identified in invertebrates such as snails and corals.33We present here the specificity and affinity of DiscI and DiscII for a variety of carbohydrate ligands as well as the crystal structures of DiscI in unliganded form and in complex with GalNAc, GalNAcβ1-3Gal and Galβ1-3GalNAc. The specificities, affinities, structures and binding sites of both discoidins are compared and discussed. DiscI and DiscII present interesting differences in term of oligosaccharide binding, which may be correlated to their differences in localisation and to their role in the slime mold.Recombinant DiscI was obtained with a yield of 20 mg l-1 of culture and its molecular weight, checked by mass spectrometry, corresponded to the expected value. Recombinant DiscII was produced as previously described.29 Both lectins were labelled with Alexa 488 and assayed on Glycan Microarray available at the Consortium for Functional Glycomics using concentrations varying from 0.01 to 200 μg ml-1. DiscI gave excellent signals at very low concentration and the analysis displayed in Figure 1A has been obtained for 0.04 μg ml-1. Strong binding to the glycochips was also observed for DiscII and Figure 1B has been obtained with 0.5 μg ml-1. These concentrations were selected to optimize the quality of the figure. Both proteins gave signal that increased in a parallel way with the concentration and reached a maximum at approx 0.5 to 1 μg ml-1.A: DiscI at 0.04 μg ml-1 and B: DiscII at 0.5 μgml-1 as measured by fluorescence intensity. Complete results including comprehensive oligosaccharide list (Plate Array) are available from the Consortium of Functional Glycomics (http://www.functionalglycomics.org/).Quite surprisingly, there is almost no superimposition in the binding specificity of the two discoidins. When looking at disaccharides, Discoidin I binds to several β1-3 linked disaccharides with a galacto residue at the reducing position such as GlcNAcβ1-3GalNAc (n° 159), Galβ1-3GalNAc (n° 123) and less strongly to GalNAcβ1-3Gal (n° 300). Elongation by additional residues or by sulphate groups are well tolerated on position 3 or 4 of the non-reducing sugar while the reducing sugar can be only elongated at position 1 and no branching is accepted. Polyllactosamine oligosaccharides containing repetitive Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3-sequences are high affinity ligands. In few cases, such as in ganglioside of the GM2 to GT2 series (n° 201 to 209), the terminal GalNAc is also recognized.On the opposite, DiscII does not recognize efficiently any disaccharide. GlcNAcβ1-6Gal/GalNAc is the preferred motif but is recognized only when part of larger oligosaccharides. The trisaccharide with the highest affinity is Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-6GalNAc (n° 149). In most of the high affinity oligosaccharides, this trisaccharide is branched with a Gal or GlcNAc residue on position 3 of the GalNAc. The glycan array data indicate therefore that DiscI has higher affinity for GalNAc-containing oligosaccharide elongated on position 3, while DiscII prefers Gal/GalNAc-containing motif substituted on position 6. It could be noted that both lectins bind to large fucosylated and/or sialylated glycans such as n° 358 and 371 but those could be ligands of the discoidin domain as discussed below.The affinity of DiscII towards GalNAc and β–Methyl-galactoside (βMeGal) was previously determined using titration microcalorimetry, leading to dissociation constants of 1.15 and 0.95 mM, respectively.29 When DiscI is assayed with the same approach, higher affinity is observed towards GalNAc (Kd = 0.3 mM) while galactose and βMeGal have lower affinity (Kd in the range of 3 to 4 mM) (Table 1). DiscI affinity for disaccharides confirm the preference for β1-3Gal/GalNAc linked disaccharides. Among tested disaccharides, Galβ1-3GalNAc is the best ligand with a Kd of 27 μM, which is a rather high affinity for lectin/glycan interaction. GalNAcβ1-3Gal is also a strong ligand with a Kd of approx 50 μM, while Galβ1-4GlcNAc (LacNAc) is a poor ligand with a Kd in the millimolar range.Microcalorimetry data. All values are averaged over two or three experiments. The reported standard deviations are calculated upon averaging of those experiments, unless otherwise specified.The affinity of DiscII towards disaccharides was also tested and it was confirmed that none of the disaccharides cited above display high affinity since all observed dissociation constants where in the millimolar range. The trisaccharidic ligand best recognised by DiscII is not available and could therefore not be tested.Titration curves of DiscI interacting with GalNAc and Galβ1-3GalNAc are shown in Figure 2. The thermograms display a large decrease in the exothermic heat of binding while saturation is achieved. For all ligands, the interaction observed upon binding to the lectin was found to be strongly driven by enthalpy as a result of the high number of hydrogen bonds with a strong unfavourable entropy contribution classically attributed either to solvent rearrangement or to the loss of ligand conformational flexibility.34A: Results for GalNAc monosaccharide (10 mM) binding to DiscI. B: Results for Galβ1,3GalNAc disaccharide (2 mM) binding to DiscI. Experiments with 0.15 mM of protein in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl buffer solution at 25°C. Top: data from 30 automatic injections of sugar of 10 μl each into the cell containing DiscI. Bottom: plot of the total heat released as a function of ligand concentration for the titration shown above (squares). The solid line represents the best least-square fit for the obtained data.DiscI gives rise in four days to bipyramidal crystals, which diffracted to high resolution. They belong to the C2221 spacegroup with one trimer in the asymmetric unit. The final model of the native structure has a crystallographic R value of 16.7 %, with a corresponding Rfree of 20.6 % for all observed data between 28.6 and 1.8 Å resolution. In this model, all 253 amino acids could be observed in the electron density as well as some 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) molecules, sulphate, calcium and nickel ions (refinement statistics in Table 2). In chain A, an additional alanine resulting from the cleavage of the N-terminal His-tag is found. The overall fold of DiscI is comparable to the one observed for DiscII with the formation of a trimer through the intertwining of the two domains of the protein, Figure 3.29 The native structures of both recombinant discoidins present an rmsd of 1.2 Ǻ for the 245 aligned Cα calculated by Secondary Structure Matching.35A: Crystal structure of the DiscI trimer coloured by chain with the N-terminal domain in light colours and C-terminal domain in dark colours. MPD and GalNAc ligands are represented in ball and sticks. Calcium ions are represented as spheres according to chain colours and nickel ions as a yellow sphere. B: Schematic representation of DiscI topology.Data collection and refinement statistics.The N-terminal domain (1-155) presents the classical topology of the discoidin domain with a β-sandwich consisting of eight antiparallel strands arranged in two β-sheets of five and three β-strands packed against one another to form a distorted barrel, Figure 3.36,37 Prominent loops protrude like spikes on the opposite side of the termini creating a ligand binding site, where either a molecule of MPD or glycerol depending on the structure, is observed. At the level of the pseudo 3-fold axis of the trimer, a strong peak of positive density appears between the three His16 side chains. It was modelled as nickel and is probably a residual from the affinity chromatography. In the disaccharide complexes resulting from another batch of protein, it was modelled as water since there was no extra positive density and a slight movement of the His16 side chain yielded to coordination distances more relevant to water than nickel.The C-terminal domain presents the immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold typical of H-type lectins first observed for Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA) and then for DiscII.29,33 It consists of six antiparallel β-strands, which form two sheets of three β-strands stacked against one another.33 Inspection of the electron density map also reveals the presence of three ions identified as calcium according to the distance values and coordination numbers.38 Each calcium is found in the middle of the C-terminal domain at the interface between two monomers. It presents seven coordinations, five of them in a plane, one above the plane and one under.38 The contacts involve bidentate Asp246 (β14), monodentate Asp164 (β9) and Asp203 (β11), Gln219 (β12) from the neighbouring monomer and two water molecules coordinating the main chain oxygen atoms of Leu198 and Val200 (β11) from the neighbouring monomer. The interactions that involve four β-strands over six would help to maintain the trimeric arrangement of the lectin domain. That would explain the dependence for divalent cation for carbohydrate binding and the destabilising role of EDTA and EGTA observed for DiscI.28 In DiscII, which is not calcium-dependant, the position of the calcium ion is occupied by the NZ of Lys206 and other interactions stabilise the trimer.The N-terminal discoidin domain of DiscI is found in a variety of extracellular and membrane proteins from about 100 eukaryotes and 300 prokaryotes such as coagulation factors, neuropilins, discoidin domain receptors (DDRs) or carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) associated with enzymes.30,31 Such domains evolved from a common ancestor to bind very diverse ligands (collagen, lipids, carbohydrates or growth factors) via a binding site formed by surface loops (spikes) that protrude at the β-barrel opening. The nature and length of those spikes define therefore the protein specificity and are responsible for its biological function. Search of the protein structure database using DALI shows that besides DiscII, coagulation factors, neuropilin, lactadherin and several carbohydrate binding modules share the DS domain fold.39 The latter belong to families CBM32 and CBM47 in the CAZy database (http://www.cazy.org), which bind mainly galactose and fucose respectively.40 The structural homologues of discoidins that also forms trimers are F-type fucose binding lectins comprising the Anguilla anguilla agglutinin and the F-lectin from striped bass (PDB 3CQO).41The overlay of the monomer of those different proteins shows that their carbohydrate binding site is located at the same position than the observed MPD/glycerol binding site of DiscI and DiscII. The ligand environment in AAA, CBMs and discoidins presents similarity, Figure 4. A hydrophobic residue (Tyr23 in DiscI, Leu23 in AAA, Tyr18 in the F-lectin and Trp/Tyr in CBMs), which makes stacking interactions with the ligand, is always found in the first spike of the first loop. Several charged residues (His27, His142, Gln84 in DiscI), which would be involved in the hydrogen bond network, are also observed but they are different from those of the F-type lectins. At position 82, an alanine is observed in isoform A contrary to a histidine in the other isoforms and in DiscII. This residue could also play a role in substrate binding and its possible regulation by phosphorylation has been proposed in DiscII.29 The third loop in discoidins contains the RGD motif, which promotes cell attachment to substrate in mammalian cells.23 The arginine of this motif is conserved in homologous F-type lectins and CBMs. In F-type lectins, this residue makes hydrogen bonds with the ring oxygen and an axial hydroxyl group at carbon 4 selecting the L-galacto configuration of fucose, Figure 4B. The binding site of the DS domain of discoidins present all required characteristics to bind carbohydrates.A: Blow up of the glycerol/MPD binding site of DiscI (green) and DiscII (cyan) respectively. B: Blow up of fucose binding site of AAA (magenta) and the F-Lectin from striped Bass (salmon) in the same orientation than discoidins.Crystallization studies of complexes with mono and disaccharides were performed in order to understand the tenfold increase in DiscI affinity for disaccharides Galβ1-3GalNAc and GalNAcβ1-3Gal, when compared to GalNAc monosaccharide. The complex structure of DiscI with GalNAc at 1.75 Å resolution was obtained by soaking while those with the disaccharides Galβ1-3GalNAc and GalNAcβ1-3Gal at 1.8 and 1.6 Å respectively were obtained by cocrystallisation. All crystals belong to the C2221 space group and data and refinement statistics are summarised in Table 2. Inspection of the initial electron-density map revealed for each monomer unambiguous density for the sugars in a shallow groove at the interface between two monomers. In the DiscI/GalNAcβ1-3Gal complex, the density for the Gal residue was of good enough quality only after positioning and refinement of the GalNAc moiety.In the DiscI/GalNAc complex, the monosaccharide is found in the same position as the one observed previously in the other H-type lectins.29,33,42 It is mainly involved in direct hydrogen bonds with the protein, Figure 5A. The O3 hydroxyl interacts with Trp235 NE1 and Asp206 OD2 (neighbouring monomer), the O4 hydroxyl with Asp206 OD1 (neighbouring monomer) and Arg215 NE and NH2, the ring oxygen with Arg215 NH2, the O7 and O1 hydroxyls with Asn236 ND2 (Details of distances are listed in Table 3). A single water-mediated interaction is usually observed between the O6 hydroxyl and Asn174 ND2. Tyr241 side chain (neighbouring monomer) is involved in hydrophobic interaction with part of the sugar ring which includes C3, C4, C5 and C6. Its orientation is quite different from the one observed in HPA where its equivalent Tyr89 has rotated of about 145° around the Cα-Cβ bond and only stacks against the O6 hydroxymethyl group of GalNAc.A: Representation of the maximum-likelihood weighted 2mFo-DFc electron density around the GalNAc complexed to DiscI contoured at 1σ (0.41 eA3). Hydrogen bonds are represented as dotted lines and waters as magenta spheres. B: Overlay of the GalNAc binding site of DiscI (cyan/marine), DiscII (green/yellow) and HPA (salmon/magenta). The residues are labelled according to their polypeptide chain and number.Contacts between DiscI and its ligand in the complex crystal structures with standard deviation calculated for the three binding sites of the trimer between brackets.The specificity of DiscI and other H-type lectins for monosaccharides with D-galacto configuration is determined by the fact that most observed interactions involve the O3 and O4 hydroxyls. Those two have to adopt equatorial and axial orientation respectively for optimal binding since any other stereochemistry at those positions would lead to steric conflict with Tyr241 and to the lost of crucial hydrogen bonds with the protein. The amino acids involved are strictly conserved among H-type lectins (Asp206, Arg215 and Trp235 in DiscI).Comparison of the structures of H-type lectins in complex with GalNAc indicates that the anomeric preference is influenced by the residue following the conserved Trp in the last surface loop, Figure 5B. In HPA, His84 side chain would hinder the accommodation of the β-anomer justifying HPA specificity for αGalNAc.33 In DiscII, Gly239 allows the binding of both anomers as observed in its GalNAc complex structure.29 In DiscI, both anomers can bind as observed in the Galβ1-3GalNAc complex structure. Asn236 favours however the binding of the β-anomer as demonstrated in the ITC experiments where DiscI has higher affinity for βMeGal than for αMeGal (Table 1). Asn236 also interacts with the N-acetyl group of GalNAc, which explains the better affinity of DiscI for GalNAc compare to Gal.In the DiscI/GalNAcβ1-3Gal complex structure, the GalNAc moiety is found in the previously described position and presents the same hydrogen bond network. The galactose moiety is oriented outwards at the protein surface and only makes two hydrogen bonds between the O3 and O4 hydroxyls and the Asn236 ND2, Figure 6A. In the DiscI/Galβ1- 3GalNAc complex, the GalNAc moiety is also in the primary binding site but in a different orientation since it is rotated by about -30° around the anomeric carbon. At the protein level, no changes in amino acids conformation are detected. This mostly modifies the interactions involving the O3 and O4 hydroxyls. The hydrogen bond between the O3 hydroxyl and Trp235 is weaker whilst the one with Asp206 is lost. At the level of the O4 hydroxyl, the loss of the hydrogen bond with Arg215 NH2 is compensated by a new one with Trp235 NE1. It interacts now with the Asp206 OD2 (neighbouring monomer) instead of the OD1, Figure 6B. The O6 hydroxyl can present a second conformation, which interacts with the Asp206 OD1 (neighbouring monomer). The GalNAc shift allows the good positioning of the galactose moiety in the binding site. The hydrogen bond network created involves the O5 hydroxyl with Trp235 NE1, the O6 hydroxyl with Ser242 OG (neighbouring monomer) and Asp206 OD2 (neighbouring monomer) and the O4 hydroxyl with Gln204 OE1 (neighbouring monomer) via a water molecule. No interaction is observed for the O2 and O3 hydroxyls. The additional interactions with the galactose moiety explain the better affinity of DiscI for the disaccharides than for the monosaccharide. The better recognition of Galβ1-3GalNAc compare to GalNacβ1-3Gal by DiscI is related to the more enclosed environment of its galactose moiety that makes twice as many and stronger hydrogen bonds with the protein, Figure 6C.Representation of the maximum-likelihood weighted 2mFo-DFc electron density around the GalNAcβ1-3Gal (A) and Galβ1-3GalNAc (B) complexed to DiscI contoured at 1σ (0.44 and 0.45 eA3 respectively). Hydrogen bonds are represented as dotted lines and waters as magenta spheres. C: Overlay of the interactions of the disaccharides with DiscI. The Galβ1-3GalNAc and GalNAcβ1-3Gal disaccharides are coloured in light and dark green respectively. The residues are labelled according to their polypeptide chain and number.DiscII has no strong affinity for disaccharide (excepted sulphated ones) but binds efficiently to Galβ1-4GlcNacβ1-6βGalNAc trisaccharide present on core 2 and core 4 mucins. Since the trisaccharide was not available for ITC and cocrystallization experiments, it was modelled into DiscII binding site, with the reducing GalNAc sitting in the position observed in the crystal structures. The trisaccharide is accommodated in a shallow groove at the top of the β-sandwich and extends towards the surface of the lectin trimer. This area is rather hydrophilic and two hydrogen bonds from the O6 hydroxyl of GlcNAc to Asn177 side chain and Ala242 carbonyl group are predicted. Additional stabilising interactions are established by van der Waals interaction between the non-reducing galactose of the trisaccharide and the aromatic group of His211. The absence of this residue in DiscI (Thr208) may explain its lack of affinity for 1-6 branched GalNAc.The main difference in the overall structure and binding site architecture of H-type lectins is observed in the regions of the first and third surface loops that play a role in tuning the specificity and affinity towards oligosaccharides. The first loop varies in sequence, length and structure from one member to the other while the third one varies in sequence and conformation, Figure 7A. Their N-terminal part in one monomer creates with their C-terminal part of the neighbouring monomer a shallow groove that goes along the side of the β-sandwich and continues across its top. Along the side, it is formed on one side by the N-terminal part of the first loop (167-174 in DiscI, 169-177 in DiscII and 9-13 in HPA) and on the other side by its neighbouring C-terminal one (177-179 in DiscI, 180-182 in DiscII and 17-28 in HPA). At the top of the binding surface, one side entails both ends of the third loop and the other the part of the first loop not listed above.A: Cartoon representation of the superimposition of DiscI (light green/green), DiscII (cyan/blue) and HPA (salmon/magenta) crystal structures.

The Galβ1-3GalNAc and GalNAcβ1-3Gal disaccharides are coloured in light and dark green respectively.The binding side has almost an inverted L shape in discoidins and is deeper, narrower and more extended in DiscI than in DiscII along the side of β-sandwich, Figure 7B/C. This allows DiscI to recognise type 3/4 oligosaccharides such as polylactosamine contrary to DiscII which lacks affinity for those since its binding side is far too open on that area to discriminate any sugar. Across the top of the binding surface, the differences in sequence in the third loop are determinant for the recognition of 1,6 oligosaccharides by DiscII with in particularly the presence of His211. The model of Galβ1-4GlcNacβ1-6βGalNAc in the binding site of DiscII also illustrates that the O3 of GalNAc is available for branching residue, which could extend the interaction area.Following the differences in conformation of third loop and of Tyr89, the binding site of HPA extends towards the top of the trimer. The orientation of Tyr89 side chain prevents the binding of 1,6 branched oligosaccharides in a similar way to discoidins. The C-terminal end of the first loop is longer by at least seven amino acids in HPA compared to discoidins that leads to a narrower, deeper and more extended groove with a twist on the side than in discoidins, Figure 7D. This would result in a more restricted specificity for 1,3 branched GalNAc as observed on the glycan arrays.33 This part of the loop is also involved in HPA specificity for monosaccharide since it surrounds and stabilises the N-acetyl group and the O3 hydroxyl of GalNAc via several hydrogen bonds that would favour the binding of GalNAc to galactose. In discoidins, it is short and does not interact with the monosaccharide.Discoidins I and II are two domain proteins assembled as trimers. We reported previously the trimeric structure of DiscII, while the present work focuses on isoform A of DiscI. The structure of isoforms C and D of DiscI should be almost identical to this one since they only differ by 13 and 9 amino acids respectively. These mutations are mainly located at the protein surface and only one is not found in the DS domain. It is very likely that heterotrimers combining the different isoforms are formed in the slime mold but no experimental details are available.The binding site of the DS domain is very similar for both discoidins and the nature of its ligand is unknown. The presence of MPD and glycerol molecules, often observed in the carbohydrate binding sites, together with the overall similarity to many carbohydrate binding protein, suggests that it could bind carbohydrates. According to the glycan array results, fucosylated and/or sialylated N and O-glycans could be candidates since they are the only ones recognised by both discoidins and do not have the required characteristics to be ligands for the H-type lectin domain. Such ligand would be also in agreement with the proposed glycoprotein receptor for DiscI DS domain.24 The strong resemblance in fold, quaternary structure and binding site properties with the fucose-binding F-type lectins indicates that the DS domain of discoidins could belong to this lectin family. Specificity studies on the whole proteins and their isolated DS domain are under progress to resolve this issue.The natural ligands of the H-type lectin domain of DiscI and DiscII are still unknown but the high specificity observed for some oligosaccharide present on the glycan arrays opens the route for hypothesis. There are not many data on the composition and structures of glycoconjugates present in D. discoideum. In addition to classical N- and O-glycans, αGlcNAc-1-PO4 phosphoglycosylation has been observed on serine residues of cysteine proteinases and a complex glycan containing a core tetrasaccharide Galα1-3Fucα1-2βGalα1-3GlcNAc-, has been found attached to hydroxyproline on Skp1, a subunit of ubiquitin ligase protein complex.43,44 A polysaccharide rich in Gal and GalNAc extracted from D. Discoideum was proposed to be DiscII endogenous ligand since it resembled the spore coat polysaccharide and is produced in late development when DiscII is very prominent and accumulates in pre-spore vesicles.26 The spores formed upon D. discoideum starvation are indeed enclosed in a specialized cell wall, the spore coat, which contains crystalline cellulose together with a Gal/GalNAc-rich polysaccharide (GPS).45 GPS is stored in the pre-spore vesicles prior secretion and incorporation in the spore coat and the matrix around. It is essential for spore integrity and plays a role in stress-resistance.46 GPS of the related species D. mucoides has been demonstrated to be a branched polysaccharide with repeating unit of [-3Galβ1-3(Galβ1-6)GalNAcα1-].47 Antisera cross-reactivity indicates that this GPS is related to the GPS of D. discoideum. Interestingly this branched trisaccharide corresponds closely to the glycan with highest affinity for DiscII in its glycan array. This strengthens the suggestion that GPS would be DiscII natural ligand.DiscII appears to be externalised along with glycoconjugates of the spore coat as the spores mature.11 Similarly, in early development, DiscI was found extracellularly around aggregates and slugs in the so-called slime coat where it binds to an uncharacterized glycoconjugate.25 The externalisation of discoidins in association with their complementary glycoconjugates during differentiation lets suppose a role in the formation of Dictyostelium extracellular matrices. Alternatively, discoidins could play a role in the recognition of polysaccharides on bacteria, which are abundant in soil. They could be involved in defence mechanisms by aggregating bacteria, as it has been proposed for the related Helix pomatia lectin that protects fertilized eggs from infection.48 They could also play a role in phagocytosis, the process by which wild-type strains of D. discoideum feed upon bacteria. A proteomics analysis of the phagosome indicated the presence of DiscII and of the three isoforms of DiscI.49 More recently, DNA microarray comparison between the wild type strain V12M2, which is strictly dependent on phagocytosis, and the axenic strain AX2, which is not, demonstrated that both DiscI and DiscII are strongly up-regulated in V12M2, indicating a possible role of these proteins in phagocytosis.50 Discoidins could have different role and different ligands depending on their localisation since they are broadly distributed in the cytoplasm, within vesicles, and at the cell surface.The present study highlighted the differences in specificity for both discoidins from Dictyostelium discoideum, proteins, which are spatially and temporally regulated during the life cycle of the slime mold. The structural work rationalised the observed differences in affinity for the lectin domain. The possibility of a carbohydrate binding site in the DS domain is now also opened. In such case, discoidins would be a mix of F and H-type lectins with distinct specificities. They present six binding sites as HPA and the striped bass F-lectin. Those trimeric proteins present different domain organisation. HPA creates intermolecular disulfide bridges between two trimers of H-type lectin, the F-type lectin domain is repeated in tandem in the striped bass F-lectin trimer (PDB 3CQO) while in discoidins, one domain of each is stabilised by intertwining during the trimer formation, Figure 8.33 This will greatly enhance the multivalency of discoidins as they will present two binding surfaces on the opposite sides of the protein. They would be able to bind simultaneously and non-simultaneously to their different ligands. The determination of the endogenous ligands of both discoidin domains will require additional knowledge on D. discoideum glycoconjugates. Such study will be necessary to shed some light on the biological function of discoidins, which remains unknown.Cartoon representation of the quaternary structure of the F-Lectin from striped Bass (PDB 3CQO, A), Discoidin I (B) and HPA (PDB 2CCV, C). A diagram of the domain layout is drawn beneath each protein.The discoidin I gene of isoform A ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P02886"",""term_id"":""166203480"",""term_text"":""P02886""}}P02886) was cloned in-frame with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (Histag) and the tobacco-etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site of the prokaryotic expression vector pProEXHTb (Invitrogen) using polymerase chain reaction and standard molecular biology techniques. The primers used were the following: 5′-GTG CCA TGG CTA CCC AAG GTT TAG TTC-3′ and 5′-GAC TCG AGT TAT TCC AAA GCG GTA GC-3′. Sequence analysis was in accordance with the one deposited.The protein was overexpressed in Rosetta2(DE3)plysS bacterial cells (Novagen) and in Luria broth medium (LB). Cells were cultured at 37°C up to an optical density of 1.2–1.3 at 600 nm before induction with 0.2 mM IPTG overnight at 16°C and harvested by centrifugation. Each gram of cells was resuspended in 3 ml of buffer A: 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5, 500 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazol, before using a cell disrupter (Constant system Ltd). After centrifugation 30 min at 40,000g, the supernatant was loaded on a 1 ml Histrap™ column (GE healthcare). After a wash step of five volumes with buffer A, DiscI was eluted with a 10-500 mM imidazol gradient. The Histag was cut by addition of the TEV protease at the ratio 1/100 overnight at 20°C in the presence of 2 mM DTT. Imidazol was removed using a PD10 column (GE healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl before reloading on the affinity column. The pure protein without tag eluted in the flow-through was concentrated around 5.5 mg ml-1 using Microsep™ 10K (Pall). Each purification step was analysed on 12% SDS-PAGE.ITC experiments were performed using a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. All titrations were carried out in 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl, at 25 °C. Sugars and proteins were dissolved in the same buffer. A total of 30 injections of 10 μL of sugar solution at concentrations varying from 2 to 40 mM were added at intervals of 5 min to the lectin solution present in the calorimeter cell (1.4478 ml) with stirring at 310 rpm. The protein concentration was 0.15 mM.Control experiments performed by injection of sugar solution into the microcalorimeter cell in the absence of protein yielded insignificant heats of dilution. Integrated heat effects were analysed by non-linear regression using a single-site binding model (Origin 7.0). The experimental data were fitted and the association constant (Ka) and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH) were then obtained. The stoichiometry n was fixed to 1 for low affinity ligands and fitted to the curve for high affinity ligands. Other thermodynamic parameters, i.e. changes in free energy (ΔG), entropy (ΔS), and number of binding sites per monomer (n) were calculated from the equation:where T is the absolute temperature, R=8.32 J mol-1K-1 and K is the association constant. The experiment was at least duplicated for each ligand.Recombinant Discoidin I and II were labelled with Alexa Fluor® 488–TFP (carboxylic acid, 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorophenyl, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified on a D-Salt™ polyacrylamide 6000 desalting column (Pierce). The specificity of the two proteins was then analysed using the printed glycan arrays version 3.1 of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (http://www.functionalglycomics.org/) following the standard procedure.All crystals were obtained by the handing-drop vapour diffusion method using 2 μl drops containing a 50:50 (v/v) mix of the protein at 5.5 mg ml-1 and the reservoir solution at 20 °C. Rod crystals for unliganded experiments were obtained from the solution 16 of the Hampton crystallization screen I (Hampton research) containing 1.5 M lithium sulphate and 100 mM NaHepes pH 7.5 after almost one month. GalNAc was introduced by soaking the crystals for a short time in the mother liquor supplemented with 10 mM GalNAc. Crystals of the disaccharides complexes were obtained by co-crystallization after one week from a solution containing 100 mM NaHepes pH 7.5, 1.2 M lithium sulphate. The sugars (13 mM) were incubated for an hour at room temperature with the protein prior crystallisation. Before data collection, the crystals were transferred in a cryoprotecting solution (either 25% MPD for unliganded and GalNAc crystals or 20% glycerol for disaccharides crystals were added to the mother liquor), mounted in a rayon fiber loop and frozen at 100K. Native and GalNAc complex data were collected at 1.8 and 1.75 Å resolution respectively on ID14-2 beamline at ESRF (Grenoble, France) using an ADSC Q4 CCD detector (Quantum Corp.). GalNAcβ1-3Gal and Galβ1-3GalNAc complex data were collected at 1.8 and 1.6 Å resolution respectively on ID23-2 beamline at ESRF using a MarCCD detector. All data belong to the C2221 spacegroup, were processed and reduced using MOSFLM and SCALA 51 All further computing was performed using the CCP4 suite, unless otherwise stated.52All DiscI structures were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER53. The coordinates of the DiscII monomer (PDB code 2VM9) and of the native DiscI trimer were used as search models for the native and complex structures respectively.29 For the refinement of each structure, 5% of the observations were immediately set aside for cross validation analysis and were used to monitor various refinement strategies such as the weighting of geometrical and temperature factor restraint. Manual corrections of the model were performed using Coot54 and were interspersed with cycles of maximum-likelihood refinement in REFMAC.55 Water molecules were added in Coot and checked manually. The quality of the model was assessed in PROCHECK before its deposition in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank.56,57 Details of the data and model quality are given in the Table 2. All figures were drawn with PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (2002) DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA, unless otherwise stated.The trisaccharide Galβ1-4βGlcNAcβ1-6GalNAc was modelled in the binding site of DiscII using the crystal structure of the complex with GalNAc (PDB 2VMC) as starting point. The protein moiety was edited with the use of the Sybyl software (St Louis, US). Two adjacent lectin domains were considered. All the hydrogen atoms were added, the partial charges were included with the Pullman library and the position of hydrogen atoms were optimized with the use of the Tripos force-field.58 The trisaccharide was built using the monosaccharide library available at Glyco3D (http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/glyco3d/) using the PIM parameters and partial charges for carbohydrates.59 The reducing GalNAc moiety was placed in the binding site by fitting on the GalNAc moiety observed in the crystal structure. Possible orientations of the remaining residues were calculated by systematic search around the glycosidic linkages. The lowest energy conformations were further optimized by energy minimization of the full oligosaccharide and the protein hydrogen atoms with the Tripos force field extended with the PIM parameters. Energy minimizations were carried out using the Powell procedure with a distance-dependent dielectric constant until a gradient deviation of 0.05 kcal/mol/A° was attained. The validity of the final conformations was checked by comparison with available energy maps (Glyco3D and 60).Coordinates and structure-factor amplitudes have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 2W94 (native crystal), 2W95 (GalNAc complex), 2WN2 (Galβ1-3GalNAc complex) and 2WN3 (GalNAcβ1-3Gal complex).The glycan microarray analysis was provided by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences grant GM62116.

PMC2997016,The CAZyome of Phytophthora spp.: A comprehensive analysis of the gene complement coding for carbohydrate-active enzymes in species of the genus Phytophthora,False,"Enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism include Carbohydrate esterases (CE), Glycoside hydrolases (GH), Glycosyl transferases (GT), and Polysaccharide lyases (PL), commonly referred to as carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). The CE, GH, and PL superfamilies are also known as cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDE) due to their role in the disintegration of the plant cell wall by bacterial and fungal pathogens. In Phytophthora infestans, penetration of the plant cells occurs through a specialized hyphal structure called appressorium; however, it is likely that members of the genus Phytophthora also use CWDE for invasive growth because hyphal forces are below the level of tensile strength exhibited by the plant cell wall. Because information regarding the frequency and distribution of CAZyme coding genes in Phytophthora is currently unknown, we have scanned the genomes of P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum for the presence of CAZyme-coding genes using a homology-based approach and compared the gene collinearity in the three genomes. In addition, we have tested the expression of several genes coding for CE in cultures grown in vitro.We have found that P. infestans, P. sojae and P. ramorum contain a total of 435, 379, and 310 CAZy homologs; in each genome, most homologs belong to the GH superfamily. Most GH and PL homologs code for enzymes that hydrolyze substances present in the pectin layer forming the middle lamella of the plant cells. In addition, a significant number of CE homologs catalyzing the deacetylation of compounds characteristic of the plant cell cuticle were found. In general, a high degree of gene location conservation was observed, as indicated by the presence of sequential orthologous pairs in the three genomes. Such collinearity was frequently observed among members of the GH superfamily. On the other hand, the CE and PL superfamilies showed less collinearity for some of their putative members. Quantitative PCR experiments revealed that all genes are expressed in P. infestans when this pathogen grown in vitro. However, the levels of expression vary considerably and are lower than the expression levels observed for the constitutive control.In conclusion, we have identified a highly complex set of CAZy homologs in the genomes of P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum, a significant number of which could play roles critical for pathogenicity, by participating in the degradation of the plant cell wall.Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of potato late blight, and as such, a major contributor to the Irish Potato Famine, is believed to cause annual losses worldwide surpassing $6.8 billion. This is a conservative estimate corresponding to the loss of approximately 15% of the global production of potato (20 Mha), valued about $45.4 billion [1]. Currently, no single strategy is successful at controlling late blight; hence, integrated management is presently the most reliable approach for disease control [2]. The apparent resilience of P. infestans to typical control measures such as the fungicide metalaxyl [3-7] or new approaches such as the use of resistance genes [8-10] was observed especially after the A2 mating type became more prevalent, facilitating sexual reproduction and recombination, and leading to an increase of the genetic diversity of P. infestans populations [11]. The ability to overcome control alternatives that had been successful previously is probably due to P. infestans' genome plasticity, as evidenced by the presence of multiple isozyme genotypes in sexual populations [12]. Sequence analysis of the gene coding for glucose 6 phosphate isomerase (GPI) in multiple P. infestans isolates revealed a widespread allelic assortment and the gene copy number differed in several isolates [13]. The evolutionary variation of the GPI genetic profile seemed to be concomitant with the emergence of more virulent P. infestans races [13]. Evidence indicative of P. infestans's ability to undergo genome-wide changes and adaptations was originally reported by Torto et al [14], who identified a large number of secreted proteins from EST data sets, some of which could influence the infection process and manipulate the host plant response to the pathogen.The genome of P. infestans has been sequenced recently and analyses of the complete sequence (~240 Mb) suggest the presence of two distinctive regions, the largest one (~ 74% of the genome) characterized by the presence of highly repetitive DNA. In contrast, in P. sojae and P. ramorum, two other major phylogenetic clades of the genus Phytophthora, only 39 and 28% of their respective genomes are repeated sequences [15]. The regions with highly repeated content lack conservation in the gene order and their gene density is very low. On the contrary, regions with less repetitive DNA have a high gene density and the gene order is very conserved. In general, a significant portion of the P. infestans genome is populated by transposons, and when compared to the other two genomes, the expansion in P. infestans can be attributed to the proliferation of these elements and other repeats in areas lacking gene order conservation [15]. An important group of genes found in the repeat-rich regions codes for effectors, which are proteins that can alter the course of disease. This group includes genes formerly known as avirulence genes, such as Avr3a and Avr4. A large collection of effector proteins is characterized by the presence of the RXLR-dEER motif in their sequence and recent analysis indicates that more than 500 putative RXLR-containing genes could be found in the P. infestans genome [15]. These effectors are thought to be translocated to the plant cell cytoplasm via haustoria, which are specialized absorbing organs that develop at the tip of the penetration peg, invaginating the host cell plasma membrane [16]. The RXLR motif has been shown to be required for the translocation of these effectors into the plant cell but not for targeting into P. infestans haustoria or secretion to the extra-haustorial matrix [17]. A second group of necrosis-inducing effectors, initially identified through bioinformatic approaches [14], was highly represented in the P. infestans genome. These cytoplasmic effectors, known as Crinkler or CRN, exist as part of a numerous family of almost 200 members, which in comparison to P. sojae and P. ramorum, is also considerably expanded [15]. In most cases, effectors are predicted to contain a typical N-terminal signal peptide [14,18].While the frequency and distribution of effector genes in the P. infestans genome has been clearly elucidated, similar characteristics have not been established for most genes involved in specific metabolic processes. For example, carbohydrate-active enzymes (also known as CAZy enzymes or CAZymes) are involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of glycoconjugates, oligo- and polysaccharides. Most importantly, carbohydrate-active enzymes play a central role in the synthesis and breakdown of the plant cell wall. Phytophthora infestans, having a cell wall that includes cellulose as a major component presumably requires a complement of CAZymes that can greatly exceed that of fungi. In addition, P. infestans CAZymes can effectively function as pathogenicity factors by specifically targeting the carbohydrates of the plant cell wall. Thus far, however, a comprehensive analysis of the CAZyme-coding gene complement in Phytophthora is still missing.Four superfamilies of CAZymes have been recognized: Carbohydrate esterases (CE), Glycoside hydrolases (GH), Glycosyl transferases (GT), and Polysaccharide lyases (PL) [19]. In fungi, there is abundant evidence suggesting that the GH, PL, and CE superfamilies may act as cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDE), and therefore, play a role in pathogenicity [20,21]. In P. infestans exclusively, a few reports also support the notion that CWDE-coding genes exist in its genome [22-25] and that some CWDE produced by this oomycete are actually secreted [26,27]. In this report, we present a description of the CAZyme-coding genes, with emphasis on the CWDE, found in the P. infestans, P. ramorum and P. sojae genomes, and a preliminary analysis of the transcriptional activity of some of these genes in P. infestans cultures grown in vitro. In addition, we present a comparative analysis of P. infestans CAZy gene repertoire with the respective homologs found in the P. ramorum and P. sojae genomes.Phytophthora infestans isolate FL-01-2, belonging to race US-8 was used in this study. Cultures were grown in Rye Agar A or B (for long-term maintenance or sporulation, respectively) [28], or Pea Broth (for mycelial growth and nucleic acid extraction).Genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted from P. infestans mycelium grown in Pea Broth [13] for ~ 2 weeks at 22°C in the dark before harvesting. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Genomic DNA was extracted using the GenElute™ Plant Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), following the instructions provided by the supplier. Genes and fragments of interest were cloned in pCR®2.1 TOPO® TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing reactions were performed by GeneWiz (South Plainfield, NJ). DNA digests, and agarose gel electrophoresis were conducted according to standard procedures [29].All RT-PCR reactions were performed using 1 μg of total RNA treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen), SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and gene-specific primers. Control reactions (no template and minus reverse transcriptase) were run to ensure amplification was not due to potentially contaminating DNA. Phytophthora infestans actin A mRNA was used as a constitutively expressed reference gene. Primer sequences, amplicon sizes, and other pertinent data are shown in Table ​Table1.1. qPCR was conducted in an iQ5 Real Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Candidates for RT-PCR and qPCR were selected on the basis of significant sequence similarity as determined by BLASTP searches and the lack of EST evidence supporting their expression as indicated by the information available for each gene model. Primer pairs were designed using Primer-Blast, a combination of Primer3 and BLAST [30]. Phytophthora infestans genomic DNA (as a template) and the Gradient option of the iQ cycler were used to optimize the amplification efficiency of each primer pair. Melt Curve/Peak analysis, which measures the melting temperature (Tm) of double stranded DNA molecules, was used to determine the number of amplified products and ensure there was no non-specific amplification. Reactions were conducted as follows: 95°C/3 min (one cycle) and 40 two-step cycles consisting of 95°C/10 s (step one) and specific annealing temperature/30 s (step two). All assays were conducted by triplicate. Amplicons were either sequenced directly or cloned prior to sequencing to confirm the expected target had been amplified. Gene expression was evaluated by determining the relative quantity (ΔCT) of the mRNA using the gene expression analysis software provided with the iQ5 Cycler.Gene-specific primers**Carbohydrate esterase gene sequences from Phytophthora infestans were used to design gene-specific primers for RT-PCR and qPCR. Gene names correspond to the descriptors given in assembly 1.0 of the P. infestans genome.Data mining was conducted using the assembly 1 of the P. infestans genome released by the Broad Institute [31] and assembly 1.1 of the P. sojae and P. ramorum genomes released by the Joint Genome Institute [32,33]. Sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana, Aspergillus spp., Fusarium oxysporum, Magnaporthe grisea, Neurospora crassa, Phytophthora spp., or Trichoderma viride corresponding to all families belonging to the CE, GH, GT and PL superfamilies were retrieved from the CAZy database [34]. Homologous sequences in the P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum genomes were obtained by screening the CAZy sequences against the Phytophthora spp. genome databases using BLASTP. Matches with a statistical significance threshold (E value) < 10-5 were selected. Orthologous search was done using the Phylogenetic Resources for the Interpretation of Genomes, PHRINGE [35], pipeline and the gene mappings between genomes. Potential subcellular localization and the presence of putative signal peptides and other motifs were evaluated with the following algorithms: SecretomeP (non-classical and leaderless secretion of proteins), SignalP (signal peptide and cleavage sites), TargetP (subcellular location of proteins), NetNGlyc (N-linked glycosylation), NetOGlyc (O-GalNAc glycosylation), NetPhos (generic phosphorylation sites), all available at the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis [36], and big-PI Predictor (for Glycosylphosphatidylinositol -GPI lipid anchor- modification site prediction [37].Sequence alignment was done with Clustal W [38]. No manual adjustments were introduced. Nucleotide distances were estimated by the Kimura 2-parameter model [39] and phylogenetic inference was performed by the distance-based Neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm [40]. Bootstrap tests with 1,000 replications [41] were conducted to examine the reliability of the interior branches and the validity of the trees obtained. All phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MegAlign (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) and MEGA version 4 [42].Scanning of the P. infestans genome for the presence of CAZyme-coding gene homologs resulted in a set of 435 sequences. The GH superfamily was the most highly represented, containing 244 homologs, distributed in 34 families. CE, GT, and PL superfamilies had each 49, 83 and 59 homologs, arranged in 8, 22, and 3 families, respectively. For each CAZy superfamily, the number of genes found and the families they belong to are shown on Table ​Table2.2. In addition, 96 sequences containing carbohydrate-binding modules (a CBM is defined as a non-catalytic, contiguous amino acid sequence within a carbohydrate-active enzyme that has the ability to recognize and bind carbohydrate compounds [43]) were identified. Of the 435 putative homologs found, a total of 345 sequences had E values smaller than 10-10. A significant number of genes (123) coded for extracellular proteins (all containing a canonical signal peptide) as determined by SignalP. Furthermore, 15 other sequences were predicted to be extracellular by the SecretomeP algorithm and contained non-canonical secretion signals. Eight homologs, all predicted to be extracellular, appeared to contain a signal for GPI lipid anchoring. The largest set of predicted extracellular proteins containing signal peptide (79) or with non-canonical secretion signals (14) belong to the GH superfamily. There were 12 and 33 (19 of them with non-canonical secretion signals) potentially extracellular CE and PL members, respectively. No GT genes were predicted to code for extracellular proteins (see Additional file 1).Putative CAZy gene homologs found in the genomes of P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum*The number of genes for which a canonical or non-canonical secretion signal was identified is shown in parenthesis.Frequently, the majority of members of a superfamily belonged to specific families. For example, GH families 76 and 81 had 17 members, families 3 and 95 had 20 members, and family 28 contained 21 putative genes. In the GT superfamily, families 41 and 71 had 14 and 15 putative genes, respectively. Family 4 and family 10 of the CE superfamily contained 14 and 15 putative genes, while all but three of the PL genes found belong to families 1 and 3 (18 and 39 putative genes, respectively). Supercontig1.2 appeared to contain the highest number of CAZy members (26), followed by supercontig 4 (24), supercontig 13 (20), supercontig 16 (19), and supercontig 3 (18).In the genome of P. sojae a total of 379 CAZy homologs were identified. The GH superfamily was the most densely populated with 191 homologs, belonging to 25 families. CE, GT, and PL superfamilies had each 35, 99, and 54 homologs, distributed in 3, 18 and 3 families, respectively. In this group, 287 sequences had E values < 10-10. With regards to the CWDE group (280 sequences), 194 were predicted to code for extracellular proteins, with the vast majority containing a classical signal peptide. Fourteen homologs, two of them without a clear signal peptide, contained a sequence for GPI lipid anchoring (see Additional file 2).Phytophthora ramorum contained 310 CAZy homologs in its genome. The GH repertoire was the most numerous, composed of 167 putative genes distributed in 27 families. CE, GT, and PL superfamilies had each 21, 75, and 47, organized in 5, 17, and 3 families, respectively. A total of 277 putative homologs had E values smaller than 10-10. Of the 235 CWDE found, 153 were predicted to encode extracellular proteins, with a considerable number of them carrying a signal peptide. Only five homologs, all with signal peptide, contained a signal for GPI lipid anchoring (see Additional file 3).Members of each superfamily have undergone multiple gene duplications as revealed by phylogenetic analyses. The phylogenetic trees of all PL genes found in the P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum genomes are shown as an example (Figures ​(Figures1,1, ​,22 and ​and3).3). A Codon-based Test of Positive Selection, which provides the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of strict-neutrality (dN = dS. dS and dN are the numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions per site, respectively) in favor of the alternative hypothesis of positive selection (dN > dS), was conducted using the P. infestans PL dataset. Results indicate that there is no evidence to reject the null hypothesis of strict-neutrality (P > 0.05).Evolutionary relatedness of P. infestans PL genes. Phylogenetic relationships among the putative PL genes found in P. infestans were inferred using deduced amino acid sequences. The phylogenetic trees were obtained by the Neighbor-joining method. Robustness of the trees was evaluated by a bootstrap with a 1000 replications. Not all number are shown to avoid cluttering in areas containing neighboring clades with short branches; however nodes whose existence is supported by bootstrap values greater than 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 99% are marked with the letters a, b, c, d, e, and f, respectively. (Trees with bootstrap numbers are available upon request).Evolutionary relatedness of P. sojae PL genes. Phylogenetic relationships among the putative PL genes found in P. sojae were inferred using deduced amino acid sequences. The phylogenetic trees were obtained by the Neighbor-joining method. Robustness of the trees was evaluated by a bootstrap with a 1000 replications. Not all number are shown to avoid cluttering in areas containing neighboring clades with short branches; however nodes whose existence is supported by bootstrap values greater than 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 99% are marked with the letters a, b, c, d, e, and f, respectively. (Trees with bootstrap numbers are available upon request).Evolutionary relatedness of P. ramorum PL genes. Phylogenetic relationships among the putative PL genes found in P. ramorum were inferred using deduced amino acid sequences. The phylogenetic trees were obtained by the Neighbor-joining method. Robustness of the trees was evaluated by a bootstrap with a 1000 replications. Not all number are shown to avoid cluttering in areas containing neighboring clades with short branches; however nodes whose existence is supported by bootstrap values greater than 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 99% are marked with the letters a, b, c, d, e, and f, respectively. (Trees with bootstrap numbers are available upon request).In all three genomes, CAZy homologs not considered to be extracellular appeared to be delivered mostly to the cytoplasm, the mitochondrion, or the plasma membrane. Interestingly, a few sequences were predicted to target the nucleus. Ab initio prediction of intron presence in all three genomes revealed that 61.4% of the P. infestans CAZyme-coding genes contain introns. In P. sojae, 51.2% of the genes had introns, and in P. ramorum, there were 37.7% of intron-containing genes. The number of introns per gene ranged from one to ten and their size generally fluctuated between 40 and 200 bp, although bigger introns appeared to exist (see Additional files 1, 2, 3). A significant number of introns have been validated through expressed sequence tag (EST) comparisons. It is important to note, however, that a large set of introns remains to be confirmed, especially in the cases of genes with more than 3 introns and/or intron size greater than 200 bp. In this case, RT-PCR analysis is required to confirm whether these introns truly exist or are artifacts introduced in the original gene assemblies.Syntenic analysis of the Phytophthora spp. genomes, based on regions of those supercontigs (known as scaffolds in P. sojae and P. ramorum) containing the largest number of CAZy homologs revealed, in general, a high degree in location conservation (i.e. multiple genes found in a P. infestans supercontig had homologs in the same P. sojae or P. ramorum scaffold. An example of this syntenic relationship is shown in Figure ​Figure4.4. Gene collinearity for a specific CAZy superfamily was also apparent as indicated by the presence of multiple, sequential orthologous pairs when the P. infestans genome was compared with either one of the other two genomes (Figure ​(Figure5a5a and Figure ​Figure5b).5b). Such collinearity was frequently observed among members of the GH superfamily. On the other hand, the CE and PL superfamilies showed less collinearity for some of their putative members (Figure ​(Figure6a6a and Figure ​Figure6b6b).Correspondence in chromosomal location of CAZy gene homologs among the three Phytophthora species. Rectangles in turquoise represent the CAZy genes in the three genomes; connecting pink bands indicate direct collinear orthologs; blue bands connect inverted collinear orthologs.Gene collinearity frequently observed among members of the GH superfamily. Two different regions, of approximately 40 and 30 kb respectively, from P. infestans supercontig1.2 in which 6 (A) and 9 (B) GH homologs exhibit collinearity among the three genomes are shown.Members of CE and PL superfamilies showed less collinearity for some of their putative members. In the case of CE, only one (out of five) gene located in a 50-kb region of supercontig1.16 had an ortholog in a corresponding scaffold in P. sojae but not in P. ramorum (A). In the case of PL, three (out of eight) genes located in a 50-kb region of supercontig1.14 had orthologs in both P. sojae and P. ramorum (B).A preliminary search in the P. sojae, P. ramorum, and other oomycete genomes for orthologs to the CAZy genes found in the P. infestans genome using the Phylogenetic Resources for the Interpretation of Genomes (PHRINGE. http://oomycetes-public.genomeprojectsolutions-databases.com/cgi-bin/clusterSearch.pl) pipeline and the gene mappings between genomes revealed the presence of orthologous genes in the target genomes for a majority of CAZy members (Table ​(Table3).3). On a few occasions, orthologs to the P. infestans CAZy genes were found in the P. sojae genome only; more rarely, orthologs appear to exist in P. ramorum but not in P. sojae. Less frequently, potential orthologs could also be identified in the genomes of Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and Pythium ultimum. All, but one, of the CE homologs had orthologs in both P. sojae and P. ramorum genomes, and a total of 17 putative CE-coding genes appeared to have paralogs within the P. infestans genome (see Additional file 4). Two hundred fourteen GH-coding genes had orthologs in both P. sojae and P. ramorum. Three putative GH-coding genes had an ortholog only in P. ramorum, while seven other had an ortholog in P. sojae only. The remaining 20 genes did not appear to have orthologs in either genome. In addition, due to duplications in the target genomes, several P. infestans genes seemed to have multiple co-orthologs, mostly in the P. sojae genome (see Additional file 5). Ninety-five of the GH-coding genes appeared to have at least one paralog in the P. infestans genome. Of the GT complement, 72 members had orthologs in both, P. sojae and P. ramorum genomes while three had orthologs in P. sojae only. Only 16 of members of this group appeared to have paralogs in the P. infestans genome (see Additional file 6). A total of 56 (out of 59) P. infestans PL-coding genes had orthologs either in both, P. sojae and P. ramorum (53), or in P. ramorum only (3) (see Additional file 7). Forty-eight members of this CAZy superfamily exhibited paralogs in P. infestans (Table ​(Table33).Orthologs and paralogsNumber of CAZy paralogs found in P. infestans and total number of orthologs found in either P. sojae or P. ramorum (or both genomes). Orthologs and paralogs were determined using PHRINGE and the gene mappings between genomes available from the Broad Institute.Sixteen putative CE-coding genes for which no EST evidence was available in the databases, were analyzed for expression using cDNA templates derived from total mycelial RNA extracted from P. infestans grown in vitro (Table ​(Table4).4). RT-PCR experiments allowed us to detect transcripts for seven of the CE-coding genes studied and visual inspection indicated that presumably some of these transcripts were being expressed at different rates. In order to quantify the differences of expression suggested by the RT-PCR assays, we designed real-time qPCR experiments for all genes, including those that did not appear to be expressed in vitro. These qPCR assays were performed using three technical replicates for each CE-coding gene and for actin A, the constitutive control; a no-template control reaction was also included. In order to minimize the effect of potential pipetting errors and achieve meaningful results, only trials in which individual replicate values had standard deviation < 0.5 were used to determine the mean threshold cycle (Tc) for each gene and for subsequent analyses. A comparison between the expression levels of all CE genes and that of the constitutive control actin A revealed that all CE genes were expressed at lower levels than actin A, with relative fold expressions (RFE) fluctuating between 0.00010 and 0.21440. Based on the RFE for each gene, four different groups could be formed: maximum expression (Group 1: RFE > 0.04), medium expression (Group 2: RFE = 0.003 - 0.039), minimal expression (Group 3: RFE = 0.001 - 0.0029), and very low expression (Group 4: RFE < 0.001). Results of the qPCR experiments indicate that transcripts from genes PITG_02545, PITG_03543, and PITG_08912 accumulated at a higher rate than any other transcript, as determined by their threshold cycle and RFE. Four genes (PITG_07734, PITG_08421, PITG_10850, and PITG_11976) had medium levels of expression and another group of four genes (PITG_08863, PITG_08914, PITG_14190, and PITG_18907) showed minimal levels of expression; the remaining 5 genes had expression rates barely above background levels. Overall, the expression profiles, as measured by qPCR, matched those observed by RT-PCR. The only exceptions were PITG_08912 and PITG_03543, which had not been clearly detected by RT-PCR.Expression of CE genesRelative fold expression (RFE) of P. infestans CE genes in vegetative non-sporulating mycelium from in vitro cultures, compared to expression of actin A. Values correspond to the average of three reactions. The standard deviation is given in parenthesis.The complexity of carbohydrate metabolism is in part explained by the extensive assortment of carbohydrate compounds and their diverse stereochemistry. Catalysis of the biochemical reactions involving these compounds, therefore, requires a vast array of enzymes, now referred to as ""carbohydrate-active enzymes"" (CAZymes). Four CAZyme superfamilies of structurally related enzymes that degrade, modify, or create glycosidic bonds are known: Carbohydrate esterases (CE), Glycoside hydrolases (GH), Glycosyl transferases (GT), and Polysaccharide lyases (PL). Since most of these enzymes target carbohydrates that are part of the plant cell wall, they are also referred to as cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDE). Analysis of the genomes of P. infestans and two other Phytophthora spp. has revealed that these organisms contain a large multiplicity of CAZymes (Table ​(Table2).2). Most of these enzymes are unequivocally involved in the biochemical pathways aimed at maintaining Phytophthora metabolism. The fact that a significant number of these CAZymes contain carbohydrate-binding modules, which allows them to recognize and bind carbohydrate compounds [43], would support this assessment. Moreover, the presence of relatively large complement of CAZy genes with predicted canonical or non-canonical secretion signals, which would enable them to effectively function as CWDE, would seem to indicate that these oomycetes also rely on enzymatic activities to successfully infect and colonize their hosts. Surprisingly, despite its greater number of CAZy homologs, P. infestans contains a smaller set of extracellular proteins than P. sojae or P. ramorum. The GH superfamily, with 115 families currently recognized based on their amino acid sequence [all of which catalyze the hydrolysis of a glycosidic bond between two or more carbohydrates or between a carbohydrate and a non-carbohydrate moiety [44-46]], is the most highly represented in the P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum genomes. Given the complexity of carbohydrate biochemistry and the broad range of hydrolytic activities it involves, is not unexpected that all genomes examined exhibit a considerable number of GH members. A number of these genes lack a cellulose-binding domain (CBD), a characteristic that was originally noted in the first GH family 5 gene cloned from a phytopathogenic fungus [47,48]. The CBD anchors the enzyme to crystalline cellulose substrates and it has been suggested that its absence would, therefore, facilitate diffusion of the enzyme through the host cell wall [22]. Within the GH group, the family with the largest number of members was family 28, which is comprised of enzymes with multiple, but related, functions (E.C. 3.2.1.*). These are mostly polygalacturonases (PGs) associated with the hydrolysis of galacturonic acid-based compounds, which are usually found as part of pectate and other galacturonans. PGs are believed to play a major role in the degradation of the plant cell wall by fungi through the hydrolysis of the pectin layer, which facilitates tissue invasion and maceration. Although large families of PG-coding gene have been characterized in P. cinnamomi [49] and P. parasitica [50] and individual PG-coding genes have been cloned and characterized from P. infestans [25], this is the first comprehensive report on this group of genes in P. infestans. PG genes are expressed in planta, and at least in the case of P. parasitica, their expression has been clearly linked to pathogenicity [50]. GH families 3 and 95 had 20 members; giving the biochemical activities of the former (mainly β-glycosidase, which chiefly targets the hydrolysis of terminal, non-reducing β-D-glycosyl residues, releasing β-D-glucose) the number of gene copies is not unusual. In contrast, the relatively high extent of the latter family is puzzling, as its key role is the hydrolysis of fucose derivatives, which in comparison with other carbohydrates are less abundant in the plant or oomycete cell. Intriguingly, fucosterol (a sterol with a fucose moiety) is the most prominent sterol found in oomycetes capable of synthesizing sterols de novo; however, so far there is no evidence that Phytophthora is among such organisms. Therefore, the presence of this large complement of putative proteins with α-fucosidase activity remains difficult to explain. Finally, GH families 76 and 81, which are involved in the random hydrolysis of (1→6)-α-D-mannosidic linkages in unbranched (1→6)-mannans and the hydrolysis of (1→3)-β-D-glycosidic linkages in (1→3)-β-D-glucans, respectively, were also highly represented. Mannans are found in the fungal cell wall, but more importantly, are present in all lineages of land plants analyzed to date, where they are key constituents of the cell wall and play major roles as carbohydrate storage compounds and in metabolic networks devoted to other cellular processes [51] and β-1,3- and β-1,6-glucans compose the bulk of the oomycete cell wall but are also components of the plant cell. Hence, the presence of multiple members of these families could confer a significant evolutionary advantage to P. infestans.Although the number of putative GT members was considerably large, this was not surprising as the transfer of sugar moieties resulting in the formation of glycosidic bonds during the biosynthesis of disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides involves the action of hundreds of different glycosyl transferases [52]. Members of family 41 (one of the two most highly represented GT families in P. infestans) catalyze the glycosylation of proteins at asparagine residues while members of family 71 (E.C. 2.4.1*) have, in general, α-mannosyltransferase activity (but more than 200 specific activities can be found within this enzyme class). Perhaps, the most interesting members found within the GT superfamily are the four cellulose synthase genes (GT family 2), which represent a novel class and whose function has been recently characterized in depth [53]. These genes are required for pathogenicity as evidenced by P. infestans inability to form functional appressoria when the genes were silenced through RNA interference [53]. Even more intriguing is the presence of a fifth member of the GT family 2 that matches very strongly (E value = 0) the putative chitin synthase gene from Magnaporthe grisea. Although no direct evidence exists favoring the presence of chitin in P. infestans cell wall, the existence of chitin synthase genes has been demonstrated in other oomycetes [54,55], suggesting that chitin is indeed produced in these species. We have cloned this gene from both P. infestans and P. sojae and preliminary experiments indicate that the gene is expressed in cultures grown in vitro. Results from functional characterization assays will be published elsewhere.For Phytophthora pathogenesis, however, the presence of multiple PL and CE putative members is highly significant, as both types of enzymes are involved in the degradation of cell wall components either by cleavage of the polysaccharide chains, which leads to the formation of a double bond at the resulting non-reducing end, or by catalysis of the acyl group removal from substituted saccharides, respectively [56]. All but a very few of the PL genes found belong to families 1 and 3 (18 and 39 putative genes in P. infestans, respectively), and almost 40% of these putative genes have canonical or non-canonical secretion signals. Both of these families are involved in the degradation of the plant cell's middle lamella, either by hydrolysis of pectate (families 1 and 3) or its methyl ester, pectin (family 1). Families 4 and 10 of the CE superfamily have the largest numbers of members in P. infestans. The putative CE family 4 genes found (14) act on deacetylation of xylans, chitin, and peptidoglycans while the family 10 members (15) are esterases acting on non-carbohydrate substrates. Previous reports indicate that the cutinase gene family has undergone a notable expansion in P. sojae and P. ramorum [57]. Members of this family (CE family 5) hydrolyze cutin, a polymer of hydroxy fatty acids that are usually C16 or C18 and contain up to three hydroxy groups. In P. infestans, the actual set of genes with true cutin hydrolase activity (E.C. 3.1.1.74) is equal to P. ramorum's (4) but relatively small compared to the number of these genes found in P. sojae (16). It is worth noting that, so far, no conclusive evidence has been found linking Phytophthora pathogenicity with cutinase activity.Phylogenetic analysis for each superfamily suggests a very active evolutionary history characterized by constant duplications (Figures ​(Figures1,1, ​,22 and ​and3).3). Two major clades, in which most PL genes are contained, can be seen in the phylogenetic tree for the PL superfamily in P. sojae and P. ramorum. An even closer relationship among the PL members can be seen in the phylogenetic analysis results obtained for P. infestans. In this species, essentially all PL genes have evolved from a single common ancestor. Genomic comparisons conducted with other oomycete genomes including P. sojae, P. ramorum, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and Pythium ultimum indicate that homologs for a large number of CAZyme-coding genes exist in all oomycete species studied; however, it is plausible that the fast evolutionary pace shown by the P. infestans genome has led to the appearance of a few unique genes for which no homologs have been found elsewhere (Table ​(Table3).3). We used a cut-off value of 10-5 to determine homology by BLASTP; however, even when a smaller cut-ff (10-10) was used a large set of potential homologs was found (in P. infestans this equals to only 90 less sequences than with the higher cut-off). This would support the validity of the results obtained using this method.The nature of the plant cell wall, and the fact that cell walls constitute the fundamental tier where plant-pathogen interactions take place would help explain the need for a multiplicity of CAZymes in Phytophthora. In the primary cell wall, the cellulose microfibrils and the hemicellulose [this term applies to all glycans extracted from the cell wall, to which the cellulose microfibrils are non-covalently bound, including xyloglucans (XyGs) and glucuronoarabinoxylans (GAXs)], are embedded in a pectin matrix. Both, XyGs and GAXs are composed of an extensive variety of modified and non-modified carbohydrate monomers [58]. As the cell wall is the first barrier that must be breached in order to penetrate and successfully colonize the host, it is plausible that an abundant assortment of enzymes targeting the glycosidic bonds be produced by the pathogen. In addition, these enzymes could also be associated with the necrotrophic phase [59]. The structure and composition of P. infestans cell wall is still ill defined; however, it is clear that cellulose is one of its major components (as opposed to chitin, which is the major component of fungal cell walls [60]). Therefore, the overall carbohydrate metabolism and the specific chemical activities needed for pathogenicity would help explain the vast array of genes coding for CAZymes found in these three genomes.True synteny is loosely defined as a correspondence in the actual chromosomal locations of two gene homologs from two related species [61]. Despite the gross and small-scale chromosomal rearrangements typical of fungal genomes, which can vary by more than an order of magnitude both within and between kingdoms [62], P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum appear to have retained many structural similarities in their chromosomes (Figure ​(Figure4).4). Previously, extensive collinearity between orthologs from P. sojae and P. ramorum had been reported [59]. Whereas it is not possible to ascertain the actual level of synteny among the three Phytophthora genomes given that individual chromosomes were not sequenced, the presence of multiple, collinear homologs in every scaffold or supercontig from each genome would indicate that, in most cases, they all share a very similar chromosomal arrangement (Figure ​(Figure5).5). A few CE and PL genes appear to be the exceptions (Figure ​(Figure6).6). Determining the true ortholog of a gene is a challenging task given that sequences evolve at different rates and duplications and losses are fairly common; in some cases, orthologs are 100% identical and in other cases there is no detectable sequence similarity. This makes the use of distance measuring methods insufficient to determine orthology (Jeffrey Boore, pers. comm.). For this reason, in addition to using the gene mappings between genomes, we also looked at the evolutionary trees generated by PHRINGE, which provide the actual evolutionary history of the genes and facilitate the accurate determination of orthology by analyzing gene duplications and losses. Most instances of orthology were validated by both methods; however, in several cases, potential orthologs found in the gene mappings were not validated by PHRINGE and vice versa. Even within PHRINGE, while numerical values (low seed score) could suggest orthology, the phylogenetic tree did not support such relationship. Moreover, there were cases in which seed score was high but the phylogenetic tree appeared to support orthology. Interestingly, in the GH and GT superfamilies, the number of potential orthologs in the target genomes (when present) was usually one, and only in a few situations there appeared to be more than one ortholog for a gene. In contrast, most P. infestans CE and PL genes had more than one (usually up to four) orthologs in both P. sojae and P. ramorum genomes. The overall expansion of these gene families in each species is evidenced by the number of paralogs found, especially within the GH and PL superfamilies, with the latter showing an extremely high percentage of members (81.4%) with paralogous genes (Table ​(Table33 and Figures ​Figures1,1, ​,22 and ​and33).For a large number of homologs identified there is EST evidence that suggests they are expressed in vitro. However, a considerable group of gene models in all genomes still lacks any evidence of expression. Therefore, we designed specific primers targeting distinctive regions of these genes using a Clustal-based sequence alignment, as a starting point to select the most dissimilar regions, and Primer-Blast. We attempted to design primers that would span an intron, but frequently this was not possible due to the fact that many P. infestans genes do not contain introns. In addition, these primers were intended for both RT-PCR and qPCR use, but the more stringent primer design constraints of the latter technique became a limiting factor, making it difficult to design primers that would successfully work in both types of assays. Using RT-PCR, we were able to detect seven of the 16 genes targeted. Because of its greater sensitivity and the need to quantify the differences in expression rates, we evaluated the same genes using qPCR. When determining the mean threshold cycle (Tc) only trials in which individual replicate values had standard deviation (SD) < 0.5 were used; this would minimize the effect of potential pipetting errors. Hence, on several occasions multiple trials were run in order to obtain consistent values that were reliable for further analyses. Because we used equal amounts of starting material for each qPCR experiment, we were able to use the Relative Quantity (ΔCT) method of analysis, in which no modification of the data is needed to obtain normalized data. Clearly, in comparison to actin A, all CE genes were expressed at much lower levels than actin A, and the relative quantity and fold expression of the majority of genes was below 0.005. Although all genes could be detected, there were apparent differences in expression as suggested by the RFE and the ΔCT method of analysis. Two of the genes that were expressed at the highest rate (PITG_02545 and PITG_08912) belong to CE family 8, whose known activity is pectin methylesterase. The third one (PITG_03543) has pectin acetylesterase activity (family 13). Interestingly, in all genomes studied, there is a considerably high number of CE family 8 gene copies. This result matches our expectations very well as pea seeds constitute the main nutritional component of growth medium and these combined activities would be required for its utilization. The other genes analyzed have various esterase activities but may not be essential for in vitro growth. We are in the process of evaluating by qPCR the expression of all CAZyme gene models for which there is no EST evidence or that contain questionable intron size or a number of introns exceeding the usual number typically found in oomycetes.In conclusion, we have identified a highly complex set of CAZy homologs in the genomes of P. infestans, P. sojae, and P. ramorum, a significant number of which could play roles critical for pathogenicity, by participating in the degradation of the plant cell wall. For most of these genes there are homologs in the three species, distributed and organized in patterns that strongly support the existence of synteny and gene collinearity among these species. Preliminary experiments with highly specific gene primers (as shown by the results of the Melt Curve/Peak assays run during qPCR analysis) indicate that all these genes are expressed in cultures grown in vitro, albeit at different rates.MOG conceptualized and designed the research project, acquired and analyzed data, and drafted manuscript.

PMC3003633,Physiological characteristics of the extreme thermophile Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus: an efficient hydrogen cell factory,False,"Global concerns about climate changes and their association with the use of fossil fuels have accelerated research on biological fuel production. Biological hydrogen production from hemicellulose-containing waste is considered one of the promising avenues. A major economical issue for such a process, however, is the low substrate conversion efficiency. Interestingly, the extreme thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus can produce hydrogen from carbohydrate-rich substrates at yields close to the theoretical maximum of the dark fermentation process (i.e., 4 mol H2/mol hexose). The organism is able to ferment an array of mono-, di- and polysaccharides, and is relatively tolerant to high partial hydrogen pressures, making it a promising candidate for exploitation in a biohydrogen process. The behaviour of this Gram-positive bacterium bears all hallmarks of being adapted to an environment sparse in free sugars, which is further reflected in its low volumetric hydrogen productivity and low osmotolerance. These two properties need to be improved by at least a factor of 10 and 5, respectively, for a cost-effective industrial process. In this review, the physiological characteristics of C. saccharolyticus are analyzed in view of the requirements for an efficient hydrogen cell factory. A special emphasis is put on the tight regulation of hydrogen production in C. saccharolyticus by both redox and energy metabolism. Suggestions for strategies to overcome the current challenges facing the potential use of the organism in hydrogen production are also discussed.Anthropogenic CO2 emissions have generally been recognized as the major contributor to global warming and associated climate changes. Therefore, several measures are being taken to decrease the CO2 emission. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to rendering biofuel production economically competitive to that of fossil fuels, since this will contribute significantly to the reduction of energy-linked environmental impacts. In this quest, the choice of the raw material is of central concern. First-generation biofuels are produced from sucrose and starch-rich substrates, which may compete with human consumption - inevitably driving up market prices. As a remedy, more focus should be directed to second-generation biofuels, produced from non-edible lignocellulosic materials, the most naturally abundant raw material [1], as well as domestic and industrial wastes. The accompanying significant cost reductions should make biofuels more competitive.Biohydrogen is a typical example of an environmentally friendly biofuel, with no CO2 emission resulting from its combustion. It can be produced from both lignocellulosic and waste materials [2-5], through biological conversion processes, such as dark fermentation and photofermentation. In the latter, biohydrogen can be produced using purple sulphur or non-sulphur bacteria that convert organic acids to H2 in photon-driven reactions [6,7]. Although a combination of these two processes is an interesting approach for maximum conversion of the energy contained in carbohydrate-rich substrates into H2 [8], only dark fermentative H2 production is covered in this review.In total, 12 H2 molecules can be obtained per mole of glucose, based on the overall number of electrons that can be generated in the complete oxidation of the latter. However, dark fermentation is limited to a maximum H2-production efficiency of 33%, i.e., maximally four molecules of H2 can be acquired per molecule of glucose with acetate and CO2 as the other fermentation end products [9]. Yet, this is only possible when the H2 partial pressure (PH2) is kept adequately low [10], e.g. by continuous stripping of the produced H2 with an inert gas. However, for a cost-effective dark fermentation process it is vital to obtain significantly high H2 yields at relatively elevated PH2, due to the high impact of central costs of feedstock and gas upgrading [11]. Generally, mesophilic (co-)cultures reach H2 yields of ≤ 2 moles/mol hexose [12], thus exemplifying conversion efficiencies of merely 17%. In addition, these yields are obtained at low PH2 only [6]. On the other hand, based on thermodynamic aspects, thermophilic bacteria and archaea may produce up to the theoretical maximum of 4 mol H2/mol hexose [13]. In general, the low H2 yields obtained in practice by different organisms, in addition to the requirement for low PH2, are major obstacles that need to be overcome before biohydrogen production can be industrially feasible [6].Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus is an extreme thermophilic bacterium that can produce high H2 yields [14,15], and at the same time is relatively insensitive to high PH2 [16]. This organism has recently gained increased interest due to its ability to produce thermostable cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes [17-21], to grow on complex lignocellulosic carbon sources [2,22,23], and to co-metabolize a wide spectrum of monosaccharides including both pentose and hexose sugars [24]. Although C. saccharolyticus possesses these desirable traits and several research articles have been recently published on this heterotrophic strict anaerobe, it has not yet been the subject of a review article. Herein, the physiological properties of C. saccharolyticus will be analyzed to unravel the characteristics required for a superior H2 cell factory. To further underline current insights in this topic, the physiology of C. saccharolyticus will be compared with that of other H2-producing microorganisms.C. saccharolyticus is a strictly anaerobic, extreme-thermophilic, Gram-positive bacterium that belongs to the Clostridia class. There are to date 13 characterized species in the genus Caldicellulosiruptor, of which C. saccharolyticus is described best, including its whole-genome sequence [25]. C. bescii, formerly known as Anaerocellum thermophilum, is the other species in the genus with its genome also fully sequenced [26,27]. C. saccharolyticus was isolated from a piece of wood in a hot spring in the Rotorua-Taupo thermal area in New Zealand, of which the waters have neutral pH, and are low in sulphate, salt content and free sugars [28]. Instead, The majority of the sugars present in this environment, such as glucose and xylose, are contained in complex (hemi)cellulosic polymers, which are difficult to access.C. saccharolyticus is well adapted to the selective pressure of this habitat through the production of various hydrolyzing enzymes, possession of a wide range of high-affinity transport systems, and absence of glucose-based catabolite repression [24,25,29], which are all attractive properties for using the organism for industrial purposes. However, being sensitive to high osmotic pressures [30,31] is one of the undesirable consequences of adaptation to such environment. Interestingly, C. saccharolyticus is non-motile and non-sporulating [32], although it possesses a complete set of genes for flagella biosynthesis and several genes required for sporulation [25], signifying a historical genetic record of characteristics that could have been required in past habitats.The genome of C. saccharolyticus has been sequenced and a microarray-based protocol for genome-wide transcriptome analysis has been developed, which is a major convenience for studying and understanding its physiology [25]. C. saccharolyticus has a relatively small genome of 2,970 kb and 2,760 protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs). From the genome-curation project, several new insights were gained such as the unusually high number of transposons and transposable derivatives C. saccharolyticus possesses, as compared with other organisms [25]. Since transposition increases the chance of genetic alterations, a large number of transposons can enhance the adaptability of this organism and may widen the spectrum of environmental conditions it can grow in, which is beneficial from an industrial point of view. On the other hand, this may also have negative repercussions since it can jeopardize stable fermentation processes. How to balance both impacts in practice needs to be further investigated.A general favourable property of members of the Clostridia class is their ability to degrade complex polymers such as cellulosic and lignocellulosic materials [33]. Based on growth analysis, C. saccharolyticus can metabolize various carbon sources ranging from monomers, such as xylose, arabinose, glucose, fructose and galactose to α- and β-linked di- and polysaccharides, such as maltose, lactose, sucrose, starch, pullulan, threhalose, xylan and cellulose [32]. C. saccharolyticus can also grow and produce H2 from complex lignocellulosic materials, both pre-treated, such as Miscanthus hydrolysate [2], sugar beet juice [34] and paper sludge [23], and untreated, such as wheat straw [35], pine wood [22] and bagasse [35]. The fermentation of these raw materials by C. saccharolyticus has yielded H2, CO2 and acetate as the main metabolic end products [2,23,34,35], with a maximum H2 yield per consumed hexose of 3.0-3.8 mol/mol [2,34,35]. Interestingly, cultivations on Miscanthus hydrolysate were accompanied by complete depletion of oligosaccharides and simultaneous oligosaccharide and monosaccharide consumption [2]. C. saccharolyticus degrades complex polymers by producing several cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes [21]. Properties of the cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes of this organism as well as their gene structures have been extensively studied [21]. In contrast to cellulolytic clostridia [33], C. saccharolyticus does not contain a cellulosome complex. C. saccharolyticus is unusual with respect to its possession of a multifunctional, multi-domain organisation for the majority of its β-glucanases [29]. The majority of the xylanases in C. saccharolyticus are clustered in a large gene cluster, and another cluster of genes involved in xylose metabolism is in close proximity [21]. Detailed information on glycoside hydrolases and other carbohydrate active enzymes encoded by C. saccharolyticus genome can be retrieved from the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/; [36]).The manual curation of the genome sequence of C. saccharolyticus indicated that it possesses an unusually high number of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes (i.e., at least 177 ABC transporter genes) [25]; many of which are responsible for the transport of monomeric and dimeric sugars. C. saccharolyticus has only one sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), which is believed to be used for fructose transport [24,25]. When C. saccharolyticus was cultivated on a mixture of monosaccharides, they were consumed simultaneously but at different rates, i.e., fructose > arabinose > xylose > mannose > glucose > galactose. Unlike the case with disaccharides, the ABC transporters were not substrate specific for these monosaccharides. Instead, the affinity for the different sugars varied, with a clear preference for pentose sugars. Overall, the genome and transcription analyses revealed that C. saccharolyticus is well equipped for utilizing complex carbohydrates, such as starch and lignocellulosic polysaccharides [25].For cost-efficient biohydrogen production, it is critical to achieve high substrate-conversion efficiencies due to the central cost of the raw material and the need to reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the waste stream [6]. Strategies to improve the overall process yield include the application of hybrid two-step systems, consisting of a dark fermentation step combined with either a light fermentation step [37], or a methanogenesis step [4,38]. In this way, the products of the first fermentation process, consisting mainly of volatile fatty acids, can be converted in the second step to either H2 and CO2 or CH4 and CO2, respectively. The pros and cons of these two strategies were evaluated in a recent review [6] and will not be treated herein. Instead, we will focus on H2 yields of the dark fermentation step.During fermentation, H2 is produced by anaerobic heterotrophs as a means to reoxidize their reducing equivalents. The maximum obtainable yield in a dark fermentation process is 4 moles H2 per mol of hexose, the so-called Thauer limit [9]. However, many H2 yields reported in literature are less than 50% of the Thauer limit (Table ​(Table11).Effect of growth temperature on H2 yield.A selection of mesophilic, thermophilic and extreme thermophilic H2-producing strains, showing their optimal growth temperature and H2 yields.The maximum H2 yield obtained during sugar oxidation depends primarily on the catabolic pathway employed. C. saccharolyticus, with its H2 yields close to the Thauer limit [9], employs the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway to oxidize glucose to pyruvate [14]. The genome sequence and 13C-NMR analysis revealed a complete gene setup for the EMP pathway and the non-oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) [14,25], which enables the organism to convert different sugars into precursor metabolites and energy. No essential genes for the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway have been found [14,25]. Pyruvate can be oxidized further to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR), with the generation of reduced ferredoxin (Fdred). Molecular H2 can be obtained from both NADH (two moles of which are generated through the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-catalyzed reaction in the EMP pathway) and Fdred, thus resulting in a maximum of 4 mol H2/mol hexose (Figure ​(Figure1A).1A). Several species of heterotrophic clostridia are also potentially able to produce 4 mol H2/mol hexose, as judged by their metabolic network (Figure ​(Figure1B),1B), when pyruvate is exclusively oxidized to acetate and CO2. In heterotrophic mesophilic clostridia that carry out acetate-type fermentation, NADH generated in the EMP pathway is reoxidized by NADH:Fd oxidoreductase (NFOR) with the generation of Fdred, which is also generated through pyruvate oxidation to acetate. The produced Fdred (total 8 mol/mol hexose) can subsequently donate electrons to hydrogenases that reduce protons to H2 [39].Overview of H2 generation pathways in different bacteria. In C. saccharolyticus (A), H2 is produced from NADH and Fdred, generated in the breakdown of glucose into acetate and CO2 via the EMP pathway. The H2 generation pathway in several clostridia carrying out acetate-type fermentation (B) is different from that in C. saccharolyticus in that H2 is generated solely from Fdred. NADH (generated in the EMP pathway) is converted to Fdred via NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase catalyzed reaction. In Enterobacteria (C), H2 is generated from formate, which is produced in the acetate pathway through the PFL-catalyzed reaction.On the other hand, enterobacteria are only able to produce maximally 2 moles H2/mol hexose, since H2 is generated via the hydrolysis of formate being produced from glucose through the pyruvate formate lyase-catalyzed pyruvate oxidation (Figure ​(Figure1C).1C). Interestingly, even the introduction of a synthetic ferredoxin-mediated pyruvate-to-H2 pathway in E. coli resulted in low H2 yields (i.e., ~2 mol/mol hexose) [40]. Some of the possible reasons why mesophilic bacteria can produce only 2 moles H2/mol hexose, despite being equipped with the relevant metabolic pathways, are revealed in the following sections.One of the reasons to which the low H2 yields observed in mesophilic cultures have been attributed is the thermodynamically unfavourable NADH-dependent H2-evolving reaction at PH2 > 0.039 kPa and at standard conditions (1 M concentration of the reactants, 25°C, pH 7) [41]. This is because H2 has a lower formal potential than NADH, hence for the reduction of protons by NADH to occur spontaneously, the PH2 has to be low. However, these conditions are often not encountered even when the reactor is sparged with an inert gas at a high flow rate (i.e., 400 mL/min), because the H2 concentration in the liquid will exceed the critical PH2 a 1000-fold [42]. Therefore, in addition to H2, mesophilic anaerobes normally form other reduced compounds, such as acetone, butanol, ethanol, and lactate, resulting in a H2 yield that usually does not exceed 2 mol/mol hexose (Table ​(Table1).1). A strategy to overcome this problem is to use thermophilic hydrogen producers instead, hence this works a decrease in the Gibbs free energy change of the H2-generation reaction in hand (ΔG'; [10]):where ∆ G0' is the Gibbs free energy at standard conditions (kJ/mol), R is the gas constant (kJ/mol·K) and T the absolute temperature (K).In general, extreme thermophiles reach higher H2 yields than mesophiles (Table ​(Table1)1) [13], and also at higher temperatures the critical PH2 is higher. For instance, at a temperature of 70˚C the critical PH2 is 0.173 kPa. However, this value is still well below 60 kPa, at which in practice C. saccharolyticus is still capable of producing 3.6-4.0 moles H2/mol glucose [16].To understand this controversy, it is to be noticed that temperature is not the only factor influencing H2 generation. The ΔG' of the H2-producing process is also a function of the type of cofactor involved and the ratio of reduced to oxidized cofactors [43]. Each cofactor has a different formal potential, i.e., the E0' for Fdred/Fdox < NADPH/NADP < NADH/NAD [36,38,39], and unless the cofactor specificity of the involved hydrogenase is known, it is not possible to determine the thermodynamics of the system. C. saccharolyticus possesses two distinct hydrogenases, i.e., one NADH-dependent Fe-only hydrogenase (Csac_1860-1864) and one Fdred-dependent, membrane-associated NiFe hydrogenase (Csac_1540-1545) [26]. Given that the formal potential of Fdred/Fdox (E0' approx. -400 mV) is close to that of H2 (E0'H2: -414 mV) [41], the Fd-dependent hydrogenase reaction is energetically favourable up to a PH2 of 39 kPa at standard conditions. However, this calculation is based on an approximation since the actual midpoint redox potential of Fd depends on the strain and the temperature [44]. The actual midpoint redox potential for Fd at 70ºC in C. saccharolyticus is not known, but should be in the same order of magnitude as found in other related thermophilic bacteria. From the thermodynamic estimation, it is obvious that it is primarily the NADH-dependent Fe-only hydrogenase that is inhibited by elevated PH2. Consistently, the NADH-dependent Fe-only hydrogenase in Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis was downregulated at high PH2, while the Fd-dependent hydrogenase was constitutively expressed, independently of the PH2 [45].Recently, Schut and Adams [46] characterized a novel type of Fe-only hydrogenase in Thermotoga maritima (TM1424-TM1426) that uses NADH and Fdred simultaneously. This novel bifurcating hydrogenase could therefore catalyze the unfavourable oxidation of NADH to H2 by using the exothermic oxidation of ferredoxin as a driving force. Interestingly, the Fe-only hydrogenase genes in C. saccharolyticus (Csac_1860, 1863-1864) show ≥ 50% sequence similarities to the bifurcating hydrogenase genes in Tm. maritima (TM1424-TM1426), but it remains to be investigated whether this hydrogenase in C. saccharolyticus possesses a bifurcating function. In fact, many of the thermophiles listed in Table ​Table11 and several mesophilic clostridia possess a Fe-only hydrogenase-encoding genes with sequence similarity to TM1424-TM1426 in Tm. maritima [46]. This observation could give a plausible explanation to the ability of these thermophiles to produce high H2 yields in well-sparged bioreactors.The ratio of reduced to oxidized cofactors has also a significant impact on the thermodynamics of the system (Eq. 1), which was confirmed experimentally by Velt et al [43]. In C. saccharolyticus, the NADH/NAD ratio changed six folds during growth-phase transition in batch cultures [47], and consequently the value of the critical PH2 for hydrogen production will also vary with the growth state of the organism. Similar observations were reported for Clostridium cellulolyticum [48], Cl. butyricum [49] and Cl. acetobutylicum [50]. Therefore, based on the reasoning above, the thermodynamic constraint might not be an absolute parameter for determining the critical PH2 for hydrogen production.However, the generally higher H2 yields obtained by thermophilic organisms still implies that temperature has a significant impact. An intriguing question that arises is why these thermophiles have evolved for optimized H2 production. Resolving this phenomenon would aid in designing highly efficient H2 cell factories.As discussed above, due to gaps in the knowledge on the redox system in C. saccharolyticus, the thermodynamic constraint cannot be used to estimate its tolerance to H2. For practical reasons, the PH2 in the gas phase is generally used as a measure for H2 tolerance. The critical value of PH2 (10-20 kPa) as found for C. saccharolyticus is often quoted in the literature, and is defined as the partial pressure of H2 at which lactate formation, an alternative way for reoxidizing NADH, is initiated [30]. This critical PH2 was determined in batch cultures of C. saccharolyticus on sucrose using a closed bioreactor without sparging. However, in a similar experimental setup, but with xylose as the substrate, the critical PH2 was up to 60 kPa, upon which the metabolism shifted to lactate [16]. A possible explanation for the observed discrepancy can be based on the difference in the organism's metabolic activity on the two substrates, i.e., the volumetric H2 productivity is lower on xylose than on sucrose which results in different concentrations of dissolved H2 [16]. The variation in the observed critical PH2 values can also be a consequence of a different distribution pattern of catabolic and anabolic fluxes on the two substrates, leading to different metabolite levels that modulate lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity [47]. In that sense, the critical PH2 has no strict value, but will depend on the organism, the substrate and probably other environmental factors of the fermentation process. To make it more complicated, in batch cultures on glucose (5 g/L), lactate formation is triggered at the transition to the stationary phase, even though the PH2 was low (6.3 kPa) [47]. Therefore, there are obviously other factors that initiate lactate formation [47], making its use as a proper criterion for defining the critical PH2 questionable. Despite lactate being formed, growth still continues, but rather in a linear than an exponential fashion [16]. In addition, in continuous cultures of C. saccharolyticus on glucose, growth and H2 production were still observed at a PH2 of 67 kPa at a low dilution rate (0.05 h-1) [47].Kraemer et al [51] could not find any coherent correlation between the sparging gas flow rate and H2 yield under different fermentation conditions. Due to this ambiguity, one may wonder whether PH2 is an appropriate parameter for inferring the critical H2 concentration for growth and hydrogen production. Indeed, Pauss et al [52] demonstrated in various bioreactor systems that the dissolved H2 easily supersaturates the liquid phase and its concentration is far from equilibrium with the gas phase. This can be attributed to the low solubility of H2 in water and that H2 production takes place in the liquid phase. The dissolved H2 concentration is a function of H2 productivity and the mass transfer rate [16], where the latter is a function of gas sparging rate and the stirring rate. A study with C. saccharolyticus in a pH and temperature controlled stirred tank reactor confirmed that the dissolved H2 concentration is a more indicative parameter for inhibition of H2 production [16]. The supersaturation of H2 in the liquid enacts a decline in H2 productivity via a metabolic shift to lactate, which may be a mechanism to steer away from exceeding the critical dissolved H2 concentration at which growth is inhibited [16]. To maintain a high productivity the dissolved H2 concentration should be kept low through increasing the mass transfer rate in the reactor, e.g. by using an appropriate sparging gas and/or proper reactor design.Nonetheless, since data on dissolved H2 concentrations are scarce in the literature and PH2 is usually the determined parameter, the PH2 will continue to be used for comparisons in this review.Based on thermodynamics, the heterotrophic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus, with its growth optimum near 100°C [53], should reach a higher H2 yield at higher PH2 than that obtained with C. saccharolyticus [10]. This organism also has an unusual advantage in that its GAPDH counterpart, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate: ferredoxin oxidoreductase (GAPOR), generates Fdred [54], which has an exceptionally low formal potential (E'Fd,100°C = -600 mV; [44]). Therefore, based only on thermodynamic constraints (Eq. 1; [41]), P. furiosus should be the least H2-inhibited anaerobe listed in Table ​Table11[41]. Yet, it produces only 2-3 moles H2/mol hexose, it is highly sensitive to an increase in PH2 [55], and, when present, it prefers to reduce S0 instead of protons. In nature, low-PH2 environments are usually achievable for H2 producers living in symbiosis with hydrogenotrophic methanogens [10].This preference for S0 can be explained by examining the physiological properties of its hydrogenases, of which P. furiosus possesses three distinct sets. It has two cytosolic NiFe-hydrogenases, which can reduce either protons to H2 or polysulphide to H2S, using NADPH as an electron donor. It also has a membrane-bound NiFe-hydrogenase, which can reduce protons to H2 using Fdred as an electron donor [51], with the unique capability of generating a proton motive force via proton translocation [56]. Moreover, it has a NiFe-containing hydrogenase complex [51], but its physiological role is partly unknown. As a third set, the organism possesses a ferredoxin:NADP oxidoreductase (or sulphide dehydrogenase) that regulates product formation depending on the PH2 [51]. In other words, with increasing PH2, this enzyme becomes more active and decreases H2 production by transferring electrons from Fdred to either polysulphide or NADP [51]. NADPH can then be used to reduce pyruvate to alanine, catalyzed by an NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase [57].S0 reduction by Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis enhances growth, and in its absence the organism is highly sensitive to H2 and growth is strongly inhibited at PH2 above 10 kPa [45]. There are, however, Thermoanaerobacter species that are H2-tolerant, such as the ethanol-adapted T. thermosulfurigenes [58]. This adapted strain is able to maintain growth at 1 atm H2 by redirecting its metabolism to ethanol, but its H2 yield is not higher than 50% of the Thauer limit [58].Members of the genus Thermotoga, which are isolated from both shallow and deep sea hydrothermal vents rich in S0 [59], are normally able to reduce either S0 or thiosulphate [60]. The members of this genus display varying degrees of sensitivity to H2, but H2 inhibition can be generally relieved by the addition of S0, most likely as the result of a ""detoxification"" reaction [61]. For instance, the Thermotoga sp. strains FjSS3.B1 and FjSS.B1 are both highly sensitive to H2 and the addition of S0 can re-establish their growth [61]. Although not generally required for its growth, Tm. maritima is able to reduce S0, but does not respire it, decreasing its H2 yield by 40% [62]. In a H2-pressurized reactor (H2/CO2, 80/20%; 300 kPa), however, growth of Tm. maritima cells was not observed unless S0 was added [61]. Johnson et al [63] demonstrated that Tm. maritima was strongly inhibited by H2, which triggers the cells to enter stationary phase. Consistently, Schröder et al [64], demonstrated that PH2 levels above 2.3 kPa might be inhibitory to growth of Tm. maritima. However, since the organism was cultivated under uncontrolled conditions, other effects, such as the growth-associated drop in pH, might have contributed to growth inhibition. Although Marinitoga is closely related to Thermotoga, members of this genus can generally tolerate more H2 than Thermotoga species. For instance, M. hydrogenotolerans can grow at 1 atm H2 without any reduction in biomass yield, but then ethanol is formed under these conditions, which drains the electrons required for H2 production. In addition, in the presence of S0, H2 is not formed [65].In contrast, members of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor are generally unable to reduce S0 or thiosulphate [29,62,63]. Moreover, both C. saccharolyticus and C. owensensis are capable of growing and producing H2 at PH2 levels up to 67 and 44 kPa, respectively [16,66]. Similarly, growth of C. kristjanssonii was not inhibited at PH2 levels up to50 kPa [67].The information gathered from the literature so far, in addition to our own work, reveals that S0-reducing thermophiles are generally more sensitive to H2 than thermophiles that are unable to use S0 as an electron acceptor. This conclusion supports the previously proposed correlation between the ability to reduce S0 and the sensitivity to H2 inhibition [60]. Due to inconsistencies in the experimental design for the different microorganisms studied and the lack of data on dissolved H2 concentrations, one should be aware that it is difficult to quantify H2 tolerance. In conclusion, based on this knowledge, it can be suggested to select for non-S0-reducing H2-producing candidates and future attempts to isolate promising H2 producers should be targeting S0-poor environments.To obtain higher H2 yields and productivities, high dissolved H2 concentrations should be avoided [51]. Therefore, methods to increase the mass transfer rate of H2 from the liquid to the gas phase should be employed. Several studies have been dedicated to develop different ways for efficient removal of H2 from the liquid phase (Table ​(Table2)2) [31].Comparison of different sparging conditionsCurrently, N2 is commonly used as a sparging gas for lab-scale H2 production. However, applying this method at an industrial scale is not cost-effective since N2 is inert, and thus difficult to remove from the effluent gas stream [11]. Instead, CO2 could be an appropriate alternative since it can be more readily separated from H2 and, as a convenience, it is a product of the fermentation process itself [11]. Nevertheless, being chemically non inert, CO2 can influence the metabolism of some microorganisms as well as the composition of the culture medium, and hence may not be viewed as an adequate universal sparging gas. In C. saccharolyticus cultures, CO2 was already shown to negatively influence growth and H2 production rate [31]. In that study, higher partial pressures of CO2 (PCO2) were found to increase the concentration of dissolved CO2, which is hydrolyzed to bicarbonate and protons. This requires the addition of larger amounts of a caustic agent to compensate for the decrease in pH, contributing to an increased osmotic pressure, which inhibits growth in C. saccharolyticus, and a higher environmental burden [31]. Methane is another interesting alternative sparging gas that was previously shown to improve the H2 yield of a mesophilic consortium by 88% [5]. However, the effect of this gas on H2 production by C. saccharolyticus has not been investigated yet.Other strategies, such as applying reduced pressure to remove H2 and CO2 from the headspace, have been shown to efficiently increase H2 yields in Enterobacter cloacae at lab scale [68]. However, on an industrial scale, this strategy might not be economically feasible due to high energy cost and increased contamination risk. Instead, two other alternative approaches may be pursued: i) improvement of reactor design to decrease the levels of dissolved H2 and CO2, and ii) metabolic engineering of the organism to enable it to either produce higher H2 yields at high PH2 or to withstand higher osmotic pressures.Based on its genome sequence and transcriptome analysis, C. saccharolyticus appears to rely primarily on ABC transporters for sugar uptake [23,26]. Bacterial and archaeal ABC transporters consist of five subunits, i.e., a sugar-binding protein, two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains [69]. A common characteristic of the sugar binding protein is its ability to capture the sugar outside the cell via a cap-lock mechanism, which determines the high affinity of the transporter for the substrate. Despite the large number of ABC transporters in C. saccharolyticus [26], none of them have been characterized so far. However, based on transcriptional analysis, it has been concluded that, in C. saccharolyticus, the same transporter might translocate different sugars with varying affinities [23,26].From a physiological perspective, ABC transporters have the disadvantage of relatively high energy demand, compared with the phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS) (Table ​(Table3)3) [70]. In the latter system, one mole of the high-energy compound PEP is required for both sugar transport and subsequent phosphorylation [70], whereas two moles of ATP are required for the same steps using an ABC transporter. The fuelling of these energy demanding, high-affinity transport systems in a strict anaerobe such as C. saccharolyticus requires an efficient energy-conserving metabolism. It can be hypothesized that one of these energy-conserving strategies is the oxidation of glucose to acetate and CO2, which results in two extra moles of ATP per mole of hexose on top of the usual ATP yield of 2 mol/mol hexose in the EMP pathway. Thus, with the conversion of glucose to two moles of acetate, maximally four moles of ATP can be acquired, with the net yield being only three moles if an ABC transporter is involved (Table ​(Table3).3). This means that with acetate as the end product, the desired H2 production becomes advantageous for the microorganism since it serves as an electron sink in the re-oxidation of the reduced cofactors Fdred and NADH generated in the breakdown of sugars.Theoretical ATP yield (YATP/S) (mol/mol) of anaerobic glucose oxidation with different transport systems and fermentation products.To investigate the presented hypothesis further, the genomes of known H2-yielding anaerobes were analyzed to evaluate whether they possess PTS- or ABC-type of sugar transport. Indeed, there is a clear correlation between high H2 yields and the use of ABC transporters (Tables ​(Tables11 &4). Organisms that were able to produce high H2 yields generally possess mainly ABC-type transporters, whereas low H2-yielding bacteria utilize more PTSs for transport. This correlation between H2 yields and possession of ABC transporters is more pronounced in thermophiles. For example, the extreme thermophile Thermoanaerobacter pseudoethanolicus, which has a PTS for glucose uptake, is unable to produce more than 2 moles H2/mol hexose (101), and mainly forms ethanol as a metabolic end product instead of acetate.The type of transport system with respect to growth temperature.A selection of mesophilic, thermophilic and extreme thermophilic H2-producing strains, showing their optimal growth temperature, H2 yields and type of glucose transport. The type of glucose transport assigned to each organism was either retrieved from literature or based on bioinformatic analysis (This study) using the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database http://img.jgi.doe.gov/Another strategy to conserve energy employed by C. saccharolyticus is to utilize inorganic PPi as an additional energy carrier [71]. This strategy is widely applied by anaerobes and other organisms that can acquire only low energy outputs in their metabolism to obtain sufficient ATP [72], of which Tm. maritima [73] and various Clostridium species [72,73] are a few examples that have been studied to some extent.The primary sources of PPi are poly-nucleic acid biosynthesis from (deoxy)nucleotide triphosphates and activation of amino acids and fatty acids for protein and lipid synthesis, respectively, which are reactions that operate close to equilibrium. Therefore, subsequent PPi hydrolysis is required for driving these reactions forward [74]. Moreover, studies on E. coli have shown that maintaining low PPi concentrations through effective PPi hydrolysis is required for rapid growth [75]. In E. coli, as in a majority of other organisms, PPi hydrolysis is catalyzed by a cytosolic inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase), with the dissipation of the free-energy change of the bound PPi (ΔG0'=-21.8 kJ/mol; [76]) as heat.C. saccharolyticus lacks a cytosolic PPase. Instead, the energy of PPi hydrolysis can be conserved, for instance through: (i) an active membrane-bound PPase employing the free-energy change of the phosphate bond hydrolysis to establish a proton motive force that could be utilized for transport of nutrients or for ATP synthesis; (ii) a PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase (PPi-PFK) in addition to the ATP-dependent one (ATP-PFK); and (iii) a PPi-dependent pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPdK) in addition to the ADP-dependent pyruvate kinase (PYK; Figure ​Figure2)2) [71].Proposed catabolic network in C. saccharolyticus. Glucose is transported over the membrane by an ABC transport system (1) [23,26] and oxidized to pyruvate in the EMP pathway [13,26], with the possibility that PPi can potentially replace ATP, i.e., PPi-PFK (2) instead of ATP-PFK (3), or ADP, i.e., PPDK (5) instead of PYK (6) [71]. NADH generated through the GAPDH-catalyzed reaction (4) and Fdred generated from the PFOR-catalyzed reaction (7) can donate electrons for the generation of molecular H2 catalyzed by cytosolic NADH-dependent Fe-only hydrogenase and membrane-bound Fd-dependent NiFe-hydrogenase, respectively [26]. Acetate is formed by the consecutive actions of phosphotransacetylase (PTA; 8) and acetate kinase (AK; 9), with the generation of ATP. Alternative routes for NADH reoxidation are the formation of lactate (LDH; 11), ethanol (ADH; 10) or succinate (12) [16]. The solid lines represent metabolic routes, whereas the dashed lines represent metabolite activation (+) or inhibition (-) of enzyme activities. PPi generated from anabolic reactions [71] is a strong inhibitor of both PYK and LDH activities [47,71].Interestingly, there are indications that the PPi-level follows the growth dynamics of C. saccharolyticus. When the cells were growing exponentially at the maximum growth rate, the PPi levels were relatively high (4 ± 2 mM), and when the growth rate decreased, the PPi levels declined concordantly. The dynamics in PPi levels were shown to be associated with the low cytosolic PPase activity in C. saccharolyticus [71]. Consistently, the PPi levels followed the same growth-dependent trend in Moorella thermoacetica and Cl. pasteurianum, both of which also lack a cytosolic PPase [76]. In contrast, in E. coli possessing elevated cytosolic PPase activity (0.54 U/mg cdw), the PPi levels were low (0.3 mM) and did not fluctuate during growth [76].Unlike PPi, the ATP levels in C. saccharolyticus were very low (0.43 ± 0.07 mM) during the exponential growth phase, but increased 2 folds at the beginning of the stationary phase [71]. Interestingly, the ADP concentration was higher than that of ATP during both phases [71], which is generally considered to be a sign of starvation. Similar low ATP/ADP ratios were observed in Cl. acetobutylicum [77]. Nevertheless, C. saccharolyticus grew exponentially, suggesting that it relies on other energy carriers, such as PPi, that may contribute to its energy charge in addition to ATP [71].The use of PPi as an additional energy carrier also introduces greater metabolic flexibility. In addition, it creates a stronger link between anabolism and catabolism, i.e., the net ATP generated in catabolic pathways is used as an energy input in biosynthetic pathways, which generates PPi that can participate in driving catabolism and generating ATP (Figure ​(Figure3).3). In this cycle, both ATP and PPi may be key regulators of catabolic and anabolic fluxes.Schematic representation of the suggested circulation of energy carriers in catabolism and anabolism in C. saccharolyticus during exponential growth (A), and non-growth (B), and its influence on metabolite formation. During exponential growth, there is a high energy demand in the cells. The formation of acetate allows maximum ATP gain and high levels of PPi secure economical use of ATP, including the inhibition of LDH activity and prevention of lactate formation. During non-growth, the ATP demands in the cells are reduced and LDH activity is restored due to the absence of PPi.Regulation of the classical glycolysis and the flux distribution at the pyruvate node is a very complex and highly tuned process, since it is the principal provider of energy carriers and redox equivalents that need to be precisely balanced under all growth conditions. Regulation takes place at metabolite level as well as at enzyme and gene expression levels. Enzyme activities normally are regulated via direct mass action law (concentrations of substrates or effectors) or via allosteric inhibition or activation [78]. To maintain high growth rate conditions, cells of C. saccharolyticus should obtain optimal energy gain from the substrate to fuel both anabolism and sugar transport, and thus lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) should be kept inactive (Figure ​(Figure2).2). Indeed, a recent batch-fermentation study has shown that during exponential growth, H2, CO2 and acetate are the only fermentation products in C. saccharolyticus [47]. In this growth phase, neither ethanol nor lactate was formed, although both LDH and ADH activities were detected in crude cell extracts at high levels. However, as the growth rate decreased during transition to the stationary phase, the metabolism was partly directed towards lactate formation. Similar growth phase-related metabolic shifts have been observed in Cl. cellulolyticum [48]. Studying the in vitro kinetics of LDH activity in C. saccharolyticus confirmed the observations of the batch experiments. It revealed that LDH activity in C. saccharolyticus is strongly regulated by the levels of the energy carriers PPi and ATP, in addition to the NADH/NAD ratio (Figure ​(Figure2)2) [47]. When the cells are growing at the maximum specific growth rate, PPi levels are high and ATP levels are low, keeping LDH inactive and its affinity for NADH low. It further assures that the catabolic flux is directed to acetate and H2 (Figure ​(Figure2).2). However, as soon as the anabolic activity declines, the PPi/ATP ratio drops by an order of magnitude [71], which results in an increase in LDH activity as well as its affinity for NADH and hence lactate starts being formed [47].Due to the strong control of C. saccharolyticus LDH activity at enzyme level, lactate is formed only in special cases, i.e., at elevated NADH/NAD ratios and at higher ATP levels. High NADH/NAD ratios also lead to inhibition of GAPDH activity and consequently the glycolytic flux [16,47]. Since LDH activity secures the continuation of the glycolytic flux, through diminishing the NADH/NAD ratio, the enzyme can be considered essential for balanced growth in C. saccharolyticus. It thus might be questioned whether deleting the ldh gene would improve H2 yields during sugar fermentation. It might be a better approach to control lactate production through maintaining process conditions that promote exponential growth to keep high cellular PPi levels [47]. It is worth noting that deletion of the ldh gene in E. coli only slightly increased H2 yield and productivities [79].Ethanol is another reduced end product that is formed during growth of C. saccharolyticus, albeit in very low quantities (Figure ​(Figure2;2; [13,42]). Based on sequence similarities to the characterized ADH in T. ethanolicus [80], ADH in C. saccharolyticus possesses a NADPH-binding domain instead of a NADH-binding domain (Figure ​(Figure2)2) [26]. This observation is supported by a preliminary kinetic study showing that the affinity of the ADH of C. saccharolyticus for NADPH is higher than for NADH [16], indicating that ethanol and H2 formation do not compete for the same reduced cofactor.13C-NMR analysis of intact cells has also revealed that C. saccharolyticus is capable of reducing either pyruvate or PEP to succinate (Figure ​(Figure2)2) in the reductive branch of its incomplete TCA cycle. However, the succinate yield is significantly lower than that of acetate or lactate under regular growth conditions and might only operate under combined elevated PH2 and PCO2 levels [31].Understanding the regulation of the key glycolytic enzyme GAPDH in C. saccharolyticus may also contribute to a better understanding of the organism's ability to tolerate elevated PH2. In general, GAPDH is strongly regulated by the NADH/NAD ratio [81], and GAPDH in C. saccharolyticus proved to be no exception [16]. However, the enzyme in C. saccharolyticus is more resistant to increased NADH levels than GAPDH in most other related bacteria. The NADH concentration required for 50% inhibition of the enzyme in C. saccharolyticus was 0.03 mM, as compared to 0.01 mM in T. thermohydrosulfuricus (formerly known as Cl. thermohydrosulfuricum) [58] and Cl. acetobutylicum [77]. This observation would in theory have a significant impact on the organism's tolerance to H2, i.e., if GAPDH was less inhibited by NADH, higher NADH/NAD ratios could be tolerated in the cell without affecting the glycolytic flux. As discussed above, this would also render the hydrogenase reaction more energetically favourable (Eq. 1) [10]. Consistently, the ethanol-adapted T. thermohydrosulfuricus strain possesses a GAPDH that tolerates approximately twice the amount of NADH and is more tolerant to H2 than the wild-type strain [58]. Likewise, the NADH/NAD ratio in Cl. cellulyticum is significantly higher than in C. saccharolyticus, which is possibly due to a more relaxed inhibition of its GAPDH by NADH (50% inhibition at 0.1 mM NADH) [42,43].C. saccharolyticus has several desirable characteristics needed for a H2 cell factory, such as its high H2 yields on a wide spectrum of carbon sources, its relatively high tolerance to elevated PH2, and its inability to reduce S0, which therefore does not interfere with its H2 production capabilities. However, the organism also lacks several properties, which should be considered before it can be used industrially.Primarily, the sensitivity of C. saccharolyticus to increased osmotic pressures is a major drawback that should be addressed. The critical concentration of salts and solutes at which the growth of the organism ceases completely was estimated to be 400-425 mM [30]. Osmolalities above 0.218 osm/kg H2O were found to induce cell lysis in C. saccharolyticus, as indicated by increased protein and DNA concentrations in the culture supernatant [31]. This low osmotolerance imposes limitations on sparging the culture with CO2 and on the maximum sugar concentration in the medium [31], with the latter obviously having a negative effect on H2 productivity [30]. On the other hand, the hyperthermophiles Tm. neapolitana and P. furiosus can grow optimally in the presence of 0.46 M NaCl and 0.5 M NaCl, respectively [82,83]. These salt concentrations correspond to an additional 0.92 and 1 osm/kg H2O, respectively, in the culture media, demonstrating that these two hyperthermophiles are better protected against osmotic stress than C. saccharolyticus. This higher osmotic tolerance is due to their ability to produce compatible solutes, or osmoprotectants, such as β-mannosylglycerate, di-myo-insitol phosphate and glutamate [82,83]. It remains to be investigated whether C. saccharolyticus is also able to efficiently synthesize similar solutes when exposed to osmotic stress. The low salt concentration in its natural habitat [28] may have resulted in the loss of any capability to survive in an unfavourable osmotic environment [82]. However, the presence of biosynthetic genes for some osmoprotectants, such as proline and glutamate, could open the way for directed evolution to render C. saccharolyticus more osmotolerant [31].The low cell density of cultures of C. saccharolyticus and other thermophiles, is another major drawback for industrial-scale application. It results in a low volumetric H2 productivity [83], unless dialysis or cell-recycling methods are used to increase the cell mass [84]. Especially dialysis was found to increase the cell density of Pyrococcus furiosus by an order of magnitude, indicating that the presence of metabolic products prevents the increase in cell densities. In continuous cultures of C. saccharolyticus, the volumetric productivity could be enhanced by increasing the dilution rates, but this comes at the expense of the H2 yield [13,85]. The decrease in yield could be related to increased dissolved H2 concentrations resulting from higher H2 productivities[16]. This can inhibit the hydrogenase activity and ultimately results in a metabolic shift to lactate. The same trade off between yield and productivity was also observed with other microorganisms. For instance, E. coli produces much lower H2 yields but its volumetric productivity is almost 100-fold higher than in C. saccharolyticus [13,86]. The cell density is about 200 times higher for E. coli [85] than for C. saccharolyticus [14], which contributes considerably to the higher volumetric productivity. The specific H2 productivity of E. coli, however, is low, which could be an undesirable consequence of the higher cell number, i.e., it enhances the H2 mass-transfer resistance [85].Since C. saccharolyticus exhibits a relatively high specific H2 productivity, its volumetric production rate can potentially be enhanced through increasing its cell density [83] by, for example, inducing biofilm formation. The reactor configuration is an important factor in enhancing biofilm formation. So far, most research on C. saccharolyticus has been carried out in continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR) [2,13,14,85], which do not allow for efficient biomass retention. Alternative reactors that enhance biofilm formation include trickling-bed bioreactors [11] and fluidized-bed systems with granules [86]. Trickling-bed bioreactors promote biofilm growth by means of packing material with a high surface area within the trickling bed. The liquid passes continuously through the filter, such that it guarantees a good liquid-gas exchange. In the fluidized-bed system, the biofilm is also formed as granules. This reactor system increases the turbulence, thus providing an enhanced mass transfer, which potentially also could decrease the dissolved H2 concentration, and hence, improve H2 yields. It should be noted that the biofilm mode of growth also offers the surface-attached and matrix-encased bacteria a means of protection against several stressful environmental conditions [87], which could benefit an organism like C. saccharolyticus in tolerating higher osmotic pressures. Recently, another Caldicellulosiruptor sp., viz. Caldicellulosiruptor owensensis, was shown capable of biofilm formation in both trickling-bed and fluidized-bed reactors at 70°C [88]. Moreover, the organism retained its ability to grow and produce H2 in the fluidized-bed system even in complete absence of gas sparging.This review article has focused on C. saccharolyticus as having several desirable characteristics for efficient H2 production. This is not only due to the high growth temperature of this organism, but there are strong indications that its metabolic constitution is adapted to efficiently extract energy from carbohydrates, thereby allowing the production of H2 at yields close to the Thauer limit [14]. The energy metabolism of C. saccharolyticus, based on maximum ATP production per sugar unit and the use of PPi as an alternative energy carrier, might be correlated with the vast number of ABC transporters it employs. The efficiency of the energy metabolism is further illustrated by the modulation of LDH activity in C. saccharolyticus through the levels of the energy carriers ATP and PPi [47]; an active LDH will significantly lower the ATP production flux and thus the growth and H2 production rates, in addition to draining the electrons required for H2 production.C. saccharolyticus can simultaneously co-utilize a wide variety of different sugars [24] and produces efficient extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, including cellulases [21]. It has a relatively high tolerance to partial hydrogen pressures that might be related to its inability to reduce S0.The set of capabilities of C. saccharolyticus described above is the foundation to exploit this organism in a commercial process using various raw materials [89]. However, for obvious economical reasons the performance of C. saccharolyticus needs to be further improved, i.e., both high H2 yields and productivities should be obtained at relatively high PH2 [6].Several metabolic engineering strategies can be foreseen to improve H2 yields of C. saccharolyticus beyond 3.5 mol/mol hexose, without the need for gas sparging. First, the NADH-dependent GAPDH in C. saccharolyticus could be replaced with an Fd-dependent GAPOR, similar to the one in P. furiosus [54] making the corresponding H2-generation reaction spontaneous even at elevated PH2 [9,36]. Second, introducing the genes for the oxidative part of the PPP supplemented with an NADPH-dependent hydrogenase could allow the oxidation of one mole of hexose to one mole of acetate and four moles of CO2 [14,90]. This would in theory yield 8 mol H2/mol hexose, but would not help overcome the thermodynamic barrier.C. saccharolyticus exhibits a considerably high specific H2 production rate compared to other H2 producers [83], but poor volumetric productivities are obtained since its maximum cell densities is in the range of 108-109 cells/mL [15]. Strategies to increase the cell density by at least an order of magnitude would be through inducing biofilm formation and/or increasing the substrate concentration. The latter requires strains with at least 5-fold increased osmotolerance, which might be obtained through evolutionary engineering. It is noteworthy that C. saccharolyticus possesses all the essential genes necessary for biosynthesis of compatible solutes, such as glutamate and proline [31].As a technical approach, oversaturation of H2 in the liquid phase should be avoided to stabilize the fermentation process. This can be solved by smart reactor design and process configuration. Different membrane reactors have been developed, which are capable of reducing dissolved H2 concentrations and have a positive effect on H2 yields [91-94]. Yet, it remains to be investigated how C. saccharolyticus would perform in these reactor systems.All in all, it is vital to understand the physiology of H2 production, which can be facilitated through applying genetic engineering and state-of-the-art 'omics' tools. However, so far, genetic protocols have been developed only for a few thermophilic hydrogen producers [95-98], but not yet for C. saccharolyticus. Omics-based technologies are increasingly applied for studying thermophilic H2 producers [25,99,100], including C. saccharolyticus [24,25]. Together with genome-wide metabolic models, now being developed for some thermophiles [101,102], the systems biology approach can eventually be applied to accelerate our understanding of the physiology of C. saccharolyticus and other thermophiles to increase their potential for process applications.The insights in the physiology of C. saccharolyticus, as covered in this review, should contribute to better strategies for the isolation and/or engineering of future superior H2 producers. Creating a superior H2 cell factory is a quintessential step towards a sustainable biological H2 production.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.KW conceived of the study, designed and drafted the manuscript.

PMC3008241,"Phylogenetic, Microbiological, and Glycoside Hydrolase Diversities within the Extremely Thermophilic, Plant Biomass-Degrading Genus Caldicellulosiruptor▿ ",False,"Phylogenetic, microbiological, and comparative genomic analyses were used to examine the diversity among members of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor, with an eye toward the capacity of these extremely thermophilic bacteria to degrade the complex carbohydrate content of plant biomass. Seven species from this genus (C. saccharolyticus, C. bescii, C. hydrothermalis, C. owensensis, C. kronotskyensis, C. lactoaceticus, and C. kristjanssonii) were compared on the basis of 16S rRNA gene phylogeny and cross-species DNA-DNA hybridization to a whole-genome C. saccharolyticus oligonucleotide microarray, revealing that C. saccharolyticus was the most divergent within this group. Growth physiology of the seven Caldicellulosiruptor species on a range of carbohydrates showed that, while all could be cultivated on acid-pretreated switchgrass, only C. saccharolyticus, C. bescii, C. kronotskyensis, and C. lactoaceticus were capable of hydrolyzing Whatman no. 1 filter paper. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the secretomes from cells grown on microcrystalline cellulose revealed that the cellulolytic species also had diverse secretome fingerprints. The C. saccharolyticus secretome contained a prominent S-layer protein that appears in the cellulolytic Caldicellulosiruptor species, suggesting a possible role in cell-substrate interactions. Growth physiology also correlated with glycoside hydrolase (GH) and carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) inventories for the seven bacteria, as deduced from draft genome sequence information. These inventories indicated that the absence of a single GH and CBM family was responsible for diminished cellulolytic capacity. Overall, the genus Caldicellulosiruptor appears to contain more genomic and physiological diversity than previously reported, and this argues for continued efforts to isolate new members from high-temperature terrestrial biotopes.Efforts directed at microbial deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass for second-generation biofuels production (24) have renewed interest in previously studied high-temperature (optimal temperature [Topt], ≥70°C), carbohydrate-utilizing microorganisms from terrestrial niches. Over the past 30 years, the focus has been on establishing the upper thermal limits of life, such that hyperthermophiles (Topt, ≥80°C) have been specifically examined for clues to the intrinsic basis of thermophily. However, hyperthermophiles often originate from marine ecosystems, which typically lack crystalline cellulose. Although enzyme systems that hydrolyze β-linked polysaccharides, such as xylan (32), galactomannan (15), barley glucan (2), and laminarin (13, 14), are produced by certain heterotrophic hyperthermophiles, primary cellulases that are highly active on crystalline cellulose have not yet been identified in these microorganisms (6). But, at slightly lower optimal growth temperatures, within the range of 70 to 80°C, extremely thermophilic bacteria capable of plant biomass degradation can be isolated from terrestrial freshwater ecosystems (30, 45). In particular, the genus Caldicellulosiruptor, which belongs to the Gram-positive bacteria, contains members described as extremely thermophilic, anaerobic, cellulolytic/hemicellulolytic, low G+C content, and asporogenic (44). With optimal growth temperatures ranging from 70 to 78°C, certain species within this genus hydrolyze cellulose at the highest known temperatures for biological degradation of this complex carbohydrate (6, 22, 56). Interestingly, Caldicellulosiruptor species lack a cellulosome, which is common to cellulolytic Clostridia (3), and instead secrete discrete biomass-degrading enzymes directly into the extracellular milieu (49, 51). Members of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor are also able to coferment C5 and C6 sugars, an important aspect for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), since both pentoses and hexoses are ultimately released during biomass deconstruction (28, 52, 57).Although Caldicellulosiruptor species were first isolated some two decades ago, there have been only a limited number of reported efforts focusing on the microbial physiology and biochemistry of these bacteria (5, 54). However, with the genome sequences of Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus (51) and Caldicellulosiruptor bescii (29) now available, the physiology of these bacteria can be examined more completely within the context of their potential role in bioenergy applications. C. saccharolyticus, the type strain of the Caldicellulosiruptor genus, first isolated from a freshwater hot spring in New Zealand, is capable of growth on cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin (44). Recently, another finished genome of a Caldicellulosiruptor species, C. bescii (formerly Anaerocellum thermophilum [56]), became available (29), and indicated that approximately 15% of the two genomes showed significant differences (31). As other Caldicellulosiruptor species are isolated, 16S rRNA gene phylogeny has been used to place isolates within the genus (36, 45), but without the benefit of complete genome sequences for those isolates, the extent of genetic diversity is difficult to assess. In order to determine the relationship among members of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor, we have used complementary in silico and microbiological methods for determining genomic relatedness in this study. In addition to characterizing the physiological response to biomass or model biomass compounds, draft genome sequence data were examined to decipher the enzymatic basis for biomass deconstruction.Caldicellulosiruptor species used in this study (Table ​(Table1)1) were obtained as axenic, freeze-dried cultures from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ [http://www.dsmz.de]), except for C. bescii, which was provided by Michael W. W. Adams (University of Georgia, Athens, GA), and C. owensensis, which was provided by James Elkins (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN). Freeze-dried cells were resuspended in the recommended medium and subcultured upon growth into modified DSMZ medium 640 (Trypticase, cysteine-HCl, and resazurin were not added; the carbon source was increased to 5 g/liter, and 10% [wt/vol] Na2S·9H2O was added to a final concentration of 0.5%) and grown at 70°C with orbital shaking. For 24-hour cell density measurements, each culture was subcultured in the respective carbon source three to four times in serum bottles before inoculating a 50-ml batch culture in a 125-ml serum bottle under N2 headspace for 24 h. Final cell counts were recorded using epifluorescence microscopy (25). Reported cell densities are the averages of two biological replicates for each carbon source reported. Sugars and biomass used for carbon sources included the following: d-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), d-xylose (Sigma-Aldrich), Avicel PH-101 (FMC), and dilute-acid-pretreated switchgrass (Panicum virgatum −20/+80 mesh fraction; pretreatment was in a Sunds reactor at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory [46]). Dilute acid-treated switchgrass was used at 5 g (wet weight)/liter, which corresponds to 1.28 ± 0.04 g (dry weight)/liter (mean ± standard deviation). In the case of cultures grown on yeast extract, only DSMZ 640 medium was used, which already includes 1 g/liter yeast extract (BD Biosciences, Difco).Caldicellulosiruptor species available from DSMZ16S rRNA gene sequences used for phylogenetic analyses between Caldicellulosiruptor spp. and related species were downloaded from the Ribosomal Database Project (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu) (12). Sequences used for 16S sequence identity were accessed from NCBI GenBank. Multiple sequence alignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences was conducted using Clustal W (50) as a part of the Mega 4 program (48). A 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic tree was built using the Jukes-Cantor evolutionary distance model followed by the neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap values were determined using 1,000 replicates in Mega 4 (48). Sequence identity percentages were determined using the BLASTN program (1).For a comparison of secretomes, each Caldicellulosiruptor species was transferred four times on modified DSM 640 medium, with either Avicel PH-101, d-xylose, or d-glucose as a carbon source (see above). Supernatant was harvested from two 500-ml batch cultures and grown for 24 h in 45-mm-diameter screw-top bottles. Briefly, the cultures were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min to separate cells and insoluble Avicel from the medium, with the resulting supernatant filtered through a bottle-top 0.22-μm-pore-size filter (Millipore) and stored at 4°C with the addition of sodium azide (0.5%, final concentration). Sterile-filtered supernatant was further concentrated with ultrafiltration using a 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff polyethersulfone membrane (Millipore) to 100×, after which the concentrated supernatant was buffer exchanged three times into 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Total protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent using the microassay for microtiter plate method per the manufacturer's protocol.Buffer-exchanged supernatant corresponding to 100 or 150 μg of protein was resuspended in isoelectric focusing (IEF) buffer, per the manufacturer's recommendations {7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (wt/vol) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 50 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2% (vol/vol) Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholyte (Bio-Rad)}. Protein was then loaded onto a 7-cm pI 4 to 7 Bio-Rad ReadyStrip with immobilized pH gradient (IPG) for active rehydration at 50 V overnight in a Protean isoelectric focusing cell (Bio-Rad). Isoelectric focusing and equilibration of the IPG strips was done as described previously (35). The second dimension was run through a NuPAGE Novex 4-to-12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using 1× 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (Invitrogen) and 0.5% (wt/vol) low-melting-point agarose overlay. Gels were stained using GelCode Blue stain reagent (Thermo Scientific) or Silver Stain Plus (Bio-Rad) and scanned on a GS-710 densitometer (Bio-Rad). Identification of proteins from two-dimensional (2D) gels was performed by the Genomic Sciences Laboratory at NCSU. For protein identification, a 1-mm-diameter core was taken from a representative 2D gel and subjected to trypsin digestion, and subsequent identification was made after analysis by liquid chromatography (LC)-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a Thermo LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).Genomic DNA (gDNA) was harvested from Caldicellulosiruptor species grown to early stationary phase on modified DSMZ 640 plus cellobiose (Sigma). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm, and DNA was isolated, as previously described (18), with the addition of 100 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) during cell lysis. Genomic DNA was partially digested with HaeIII (New England BioLabs [NEB]), and amino allyl dUTP (Ambion) was incorporated along with deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Roche) using Klenow fragment (NEB) and random nonamers (Sigma). Labeling with Cy3 or Cy5 N-hydroxysuccinimide ester dye (GE Healthcare) was performed in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9. Unincorporated dye was removed using Qiaquick spin columns according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). Cy dye-labeled gDNA was hybridized to a C. saccharolyticus whole-genome oligonucleotide microarray chip (52) using a two-slide, dye-flip experimental design. Genomic DNA from C. saccharolyticus served as the reference control in each dye flip.Microarray slides were scanned with a Packard BioChip Scanarray 4000 scanner (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA). Signal intensity for each spot was calculated using ScanArray Express (v2.1.8; Perkin-Elmer) before importing into JMP Genomics 4.0 (SAS, Cary, NC) for normalization and application of mixed effects model analysis (43, 55). A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated by comparing all normalized signal intensities from the tester strain versus C. saccharolyticus and was computed using Excel 2007 (Microsoft). During normalization and analysis, ratios for the tester strain versus C. saccharolyticus signal intensities were converted into a log2 format. The log2 ratios for each tester strain were plotted versus the location of the gene probe in the C. saccharolyticus genome to create the pair-wise scatter plots.Data from the microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (M-CGH) experiments are available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).

Annotation for the finished genome of C. saccharolyticus ({""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CP000679"",""term_id"":""145408661"",""term_text"":""CP000679""}}CP000679) was completed manually (51). These finished and preliminary annotations were examined for potential enzymes of interest, which were then cataloged based on homology to other CAZy annotated enzymes, using BlastP (1), InterProScan (27), and the CAZy database (http://www.cazy.org) (10). CAZy annotated enzymes for C. saccharolyticus and C. bescii were accessed directly from the CAZy database.Since the first description of a Caldicellulosiruptor species (45), to date 33 16S rRNA gene sequences from various Caldicellulosiruptor species and isolates have been deposited in NCBI's GenBank and collected in the Ribosomal Database Project (12; http://rdp.cme.msu.edu). Of the deposited 16S rRNA gene sequences, only nine species have been described in the literature, and eight are available from a culture collection (Table ​(Table1).1). Members of this genus are typically isolated from biomass in freshwater geothermal springs, with the one exception being C. owensensis, which was isolated from sediment at Owens Lake, CA (Table ​(Table1)1) (26). At the time our study was initiated, only two Caldicellulosiruptor genome sequences were publically available, for C. saccharolyticus (51) and C. bescii (56). On a genomic level, the G+C nucleotide content of Caldicellulosiruptor species is low (∼35 to 36%) and has resulted in their placement in the Gram-positive phylum Firmicutes (45), which also includes other celluloytic species, such as Clostridium thermocellum (39). However, taxonomic classification within this branch of the thermophilic Firmicutes relies heavily on 16S rRNA gene phylogeny (33) and phenotype. Alternatively, common concatenated protein sequences were created to construct a phylogenetic tree, which placed C. saccharolyticus with the cellulolytic members of the genus Clostridium (21). Alignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences to construct a phylogenetic tree of the nine deposited Caldicellulosiruptor species revealed that species tend to cluster based on geographical location (Fig. ​(Fig.1)1) and that 16S rRNA gene sequence identity within the genus ranges from 94.8 to 99.4%. According to 16S rRNA analysis, C. saccharolyticus is the most phylogenetically divergent member of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor (94.4 to 96.6% rRNA identity), which may relate to it being the sole representative from New Zealand included in the analysis. However, when rRNA sequences from other New Zealand isolates were added to the phylogenetic tree, C. saccharolyticus still remained divergent from both groups (data not shown).Neighbor-joining 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree of Caldicellulosiruptor species and members from related genera. The scale represents 0.02 substitution per nucleotide position. Bootstrap values are based on 1,000 replicates. T, type strain.Regardless, 16S phylogenetic distances can only capture a small portion of the true genetic diversity in closely related species (47). Previous work concerning the genetic diversity within the genus Caldicellulosiruptor concentrated mainly on the cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes of C. saccharolyticus (4) and on other New Zealand Caldicellulosiruptor isolates, such as Caldicellulosiruptor sp. Tok7B.1 (19) and Caldicellulosiruptor sp. Rt69B.1 (38). While 16S phylogenetic analysis is useful for quickly assigning new isolates to taxonomic groups, it is clear that a more comprehensive measure of genetic relatedness is needed, especially in light of the increased interest in microbes capable of crystalline cellulose hydrolysis at high temperatures.In order to further explore the genetic diversity of publicly available Caldicellulosiruptor species, seven species obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures were surveyed for genetic similarity to C. saccharolyticus by using M-CGH. Since the first publicly available genome for a Caldicellulosiruptor species was for C. saccharolyticus, a whole-genome oligonucleotide chip had previously been designed (51) and was used for the M-CGH in our study. Genomic DNA from six additional Caldicellulosiruptor species was hybridized to the C. saccharolyticus oligonucleotide chip, using genomic DNA from C. saccharolyticus as a control in each dye flip. Plotting log2 hybridization ratios (least squares mean [LSM] intensity values of each test species versus C. saccharolyticus, with a log2-based conversion) of each species, provided a visual comparison of genetic divergence from C. saccharolyticus (Fig. 2A to F). As log2 hybridization ratios approach zero, those open reading frames, and by extension the organism, are considered to be more genetically similar to C. saccharolyticus. The more genetically divergent the species tested are from C. saccharolyticus (based on M-CGH analysis), the more the plots of log2 ratios will deviate from the horizontal axis (17). In addition, pair-wise scatter plots of hybridization intensities from unknown versus reference strains have previously been used to assess levels of diversity between strains (11). In this study, pair-wise scatter plots of LSM intensity values were used to compare the hybridization profile of each tester species versus C. saccharolyticus to experimentally calculate genetic distance. For each tester species, genetic distance was reported as a Pearson correlation coefficient (r), a measure of how close the pair-wise scatter plots of the probe intensity of the tester strain versus C. saccharolyticus converged to a straight line (Fig. 2A to F).Log2 ratios for genomic DNA based on M-CGH analysis of tested Caldicellulosiruptor species versus C. saccharolyticus. (A) C. bescii; (B) C. hydrothermalis; (C) C. kristjanssonii; (D) C. kronotskyensis; (E) C. lactoaceticus; (F) C. owensensis. Log2 ratios indicate the fold hybridization differences between the tester and reference samples, converted to a log2 format. r is the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient, quantifying the linear relationship between LSM hybridization levels of each Caldicellulosiruptor species tested versus C. saccharolyticus.Of all the species tested, C. hydrothermalis had a hybridization profile most similar to C. saccharolyticus (r, 0.86) (Fig. ​(Fig.2B),2B), followed by C. bescii (r, 0.76) (Fig. ​(Fig.2A),2A), whereas C. kristjanssonii, C. kronotskyensis, C. lactoaceticus, and C. owensensis were not as closely related (r, 0.55, 0.44, 0.48, and 0.55, respectively) (Fig. 2C to F). In the case of C. bescii compared to C. saccharolyticus, a higher Pearson correlation coefficient was expected, since extensive similarity had been noted when comparing their finished genomes (29, 31). In the case of the other Caldicellulosiruptor species, the experimental (M-CGH) data indicated a greater amount of genetic divergence from C. saccharolyticus (r, 0.86 to 0.44) than the in silico measure (16S rRNA) would indicate (94.4 to 96.6%). Unlike 16S phylogeny, geographical localization seems to have no effect on similarity of hybridization profiles or Pearson correlation coefficients, since C. bescii, C. hydrothermalis, and C. kronotskyensis were all isolated from geothermal hot springs in the Kamchatka Peninsula (Table ​(Table1;1; Fig. 2A, B, and D). Use of the M-CGH technique is a potentially powerful tool to assess genetic diversity of new Caldicellulosiruptor isolates from the environment. Overall, it appears that the genus Caldicellulsiruptor is more genetically diverse than would be expected if only 16S rRNA sequence identity were taken into consideration. The question is then whether the different species use similar enzymes and metabolic strategies for biomass deconstruction.Growth on various sugar substrates has been reported in Caldicellulosiruptor species isolation studies (8, 22, 26, 36, 37, 41, 44, 56). However, a direct comparison across the entire genus with respect to carbohydrate utilization has not been done. To conduct such a comparison, the seven Caldicellulosiruptor species were grown on various simple (C5 and C6) and complex sugars, in addition to dilute-acid-pretreated biomass. Cell density measurements at 24 h were calculated for Caldicellulosiruptor species on Avicel, pretreated switchgrass, glucose, xylose, and yeast extract. Cell density measurements on yeast extract served as a control, since the growth medium contained no supplemental carbohydrate source. All Caldicellulosiruptor species were previously reported to grow on xylose, and the only significant difference in xylose growth observed here was that the cell density of C. saccharolyticus was 10-fold higher than that of C. kristjanssonii (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3). Consistent with the isolation study of C. lactoaceticus (37), no growth on glucose was observed with this species, while the rest of the species were capable of growth on glucose. Similar to C. lactoaceticus, some cellulolytic Clostridia spp. have shown similar substrate specializations, such as C. thermocellum, which will preferentially grow on cellobiose versus glucose as a carbon source and requires long acclimation times to grow on glucose (34).Comparisons of growth of Caldicellulosiruptor spp. on selected substrates. All substrates were present at 5 g/liter in modified DSMZ 640 medium except for yeast extract, which was present at 1 g/liter in modified DSMZ 640 medium. The species order was ranked with respect to growth levels on Avicel. Species abbreviations: Cbes, C. bescii; Chyd, C. hydrothermalis; Ckri, C. kristjanssonii; Ckro, C. kronotskyensis; Clac, C. lactoaceticus; Cowe, C. owensensis; Csac, C. saccharolyticus.When dilute-acid-pretreated biomass (switchgrass) was used as a growth substrate, all species were able to grow to cell densities higher than 108 cells/ml, indicating that the spectrum of polysaccharides present in the biomass (∼50% glucan and 8% xylan [46]) support growth of all of the Caldicellulosiruptor species tested. It is interesting that pretreated switchgrass slightly inhibited growth in comparison to growth on Avicel in some cases (C. saccharolyticus, C. bescii, C. kronotskyensis, and C. lactoaceticus), yet in other cases it stimulated growth (C. kristjanssonii and C. owensensis). Inhibition of growth on pretreated switchgrass by the more cellulolytic Caldicellulosiruptor spp. could result from the presence of sugar dehydration products and phenolics. In the case of the less cellulolytic Caldicellulosiruptor spp., stimulation of growth by pretreated switchgrass could be related to the easier accessibility of polysaccharides (xylan and amorphous cellulose, for example), which are more suitable for growth, even though growth inhibitors are presumably present (23).The most striking difference between the Caldicellulosiruptor species was their ability to grow on microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3). It is a defining characteristic of the genus to grow on crystalline cellulose (44), although three species (C. saccharolyticus, C. bescii, and C. kronotskyensis) grew to cell densities roughly 10- and 100-fold higher on this substrate than some of the other members (C. kristjanssonii, C. hydrothermalis, and C. owensensis). Growth on Avicel may not be a definitive indication of an organism's capacity to hydrolyze the crystalline areas of cellulose, since Avicel also contains less-ordered, amorphous regions as well (42).To further examine diversity within the genus Caldicellulosiruptor, especially with respect to cellulolytic ability, the Avicel-induced secretomes of various Caldicellulosiruptor species were examined and compared to their xylose-induced secretomes. Supernatant from Avicel-induced secretomes collected from all Caldicellulosiruptor species was capable of hydrolyzing carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) (data not shown), although only four species were capable of deconstructing Whatman no. 1 filter paper during growth (Fig. ​(Fig.4D).4D). CMC hydrolysis implies the presence of endo-acting cellulases in all of the Caldicellulosiruptor species; however, the deconstruction of crystalline cellulose requires exo-acting cellulases (34).2D SDS-PAGE gels of secretomes from Caldicellulosiruptor species. (A) Avicel induced, with 100 μg protein loaded; (B) Avicel induced, 150 μg protein loaded and silver stained; (C) xylose induced, 100 μg loaded; (D) filter paper deconstruction cultures. Species abbreviations: Cbes, C. bescii; Chyd, C. hydrothermalis; Ckri, C. kristjanssonii; Ckro, C. kronotskyensis; Clac, C. lactoaceticus; Cowe, C. owensensis; Csac, C. saccharolyticus. N/D, not determined.Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE was also used to visualize the proteins secreted into the extracellular milieu during growth on Avicel and xylose, a C5 sugar capable of supporting growth for all Caldicellulosriuptor species used in this study (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3). The majority of Avicel-induced secretomes of Caldicellulosiruptor species capable of deconstructing filter paper displayed more proteins present (C. bescii, C. kronotskyensis, and C. lactoaceticus) than the less cellulolytic C. hydrothermalis, C. kristjanssonii, and C. owensensis (Fig. 4A, B, and D). The secretome of C. saccharolyticus, however, contained one predominant high-molecular-weight protein spot that was identified by LC-MS/MS as an S-layer protein (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""YP_001181219"",""term_id"":""146297448"",""term_text"":""YP_001181219""}}YP_001181219). The microbial S-layer is a self-assembling protein coat implicated in protection from extreme environments, the creation of a Gram-positive “periplasm,” enzyme immobilization, and in some cases possibly adhesion (16). A higher total protein loading level was also used to determine if there were more protein spots present in the Avicel-induced secretomes of C. hydrothermalis, C. kristjanssonii, C. lactoaceticus, C. owensensis, and C. saccharolyticus (Fig. ​(Fig.4B).4B). While some additional spots were visible using a higher total protein loading level and silver staining in all Caldicellulosiruptor species tested, only C. lactoaceticus appeared to have significantly more higher-molecular-weight protein spots visible (Fig. ​(Fig.4B4B).Analysis of xylose-induced secretomes also demonstrated that the S-layer protein is also a predominant feature of the C. saccharolyticus secretome (Fig. ​(Fig.4C).4C). Why an S-layer domain protein is the prominent feature of the C. saccharolyticus Avicel-induced (Fig. ​(Fig.4A),4A), xylose-induced (Fig. ​(Fig.4C),4C), or glucose-induced (data not shown) secretome is as yet unknown. Notably, in all xylose-induced secretomes a distribution of high- and low-molecular-weight protein spots was observed with the exception of C. saccharolyticus. For the more cellulolytic Caldicellulosiruptor species, their Avicel-induced secretome profiles matched closely their xylose-induced profiles (Fig. 4A and C). However, for C. hydrothermalis, C. kristjanssonii, and C. owensensis, more protein spots were observed in their xylose-induced profiles versus their Avicel-induced profiles (Fig. 4A to C).As mentioned above, only two (C. bescii and C. saccharolyticus) of the nine described Caldicellulosiruptor species currently have publically available genome sequences (29, 51). Due to renewed interest in biomass-degrading microbes, five additional genome sequencing projects are under way, three of which are finished (for C. hydrothermalis, C. kronotsyensis, and C. owensensis), to help pinpoint what makes some species more cellulolytic than others in the genus. Draft and finished versions of these genome sequences were examined for GH family diversity.Previous studies looking into Caldicellulosiruptor diversity have identified glycoside hydrolases, mostly cellulases and xylanases, produced by selected species (4, 19). Here, the biomass deconstruction-related GH inventory, inferred from each draft and finished genome sequence, was examined to provide insights into the observed differential responses to microcrystalline cellulose. Based on the differential responses of each Caldicellulosiruptor species to microcrystalline cellulose, the GHs potentially involved in cellulose hydrolysis were cataloged according to CAZy GH family (10; http://www.cazy.org). Of the 11 GH families described in the literature as being endo- or exo-acting cellulases (10, 53; see the CAZy database for updates), 4 are present in some, but not all, Caldicellulosiruptor species (GH5, GH9, GH44, and GH48) (Table ​(Table2).2). All Caldicellulosiruptor species have at least one GH5 enzyme (potentially an endo-acting cellulase [10]) present in their genome, supporting the previously mentioned observation that all species are able to hydrolyze CMC. It is interesting that the three Caldicellulosiruptor species that did not grow well on microcrystalline cellulose (Fig. ​(Fig.3)3) and had less diverse Avicel-induced secretome profiles (Fig. 4A and B, C. hydrothermalis, C. kristjanssonii, and C. owensensis) and were missing representatives from GH9, GH44, and GH48 (Table ​(Table2,2, C. hydrothermalis and C. owensensis) or GH48 (Table ​(Table2,2, C. kristjanssonii). Both GH9 and GH48 are part of the multidomain cellulase enzyme CelA in C. bescii and C. saccharolyticus (49, 58). When catalytic activity was characterized for CelA from C. bescii, the C-terminal portion of the enzyme containing the GH48 domain was responsible for hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose in an exo-acting manner (58). It appears then that missing an enzyme containing a GH48 catalytic domain impedes Caldicellulosiruptor species' ability to hydrolyze and grow on crystalline cellulose. In addition to the catalytic portion of cellulase enzymes, noncatalytic CBMs involved in binding to biomass were also cataloged according to established CAZy families (7, 10). A particular crystalline cellulose-binding CBM family, CBM3, is present in multidomain enzymes from C. bescii, C. kristjanssonii, C. kronotskyensis, and C. saccharolyticus (Table ​(Table3).3). One of these multidomain enzymes, CelA, has been cloned and characterized in both C. saccharolyticus and C. bescii, and in the case of C. bescii it has been shown to have activity on crystalline cellulose (49, 58). In the case of a free cellulase from Clostridium thermocellum, CelI, the presence of a C-terminal CBM3 module was determined to be essential for crystalline cellulose hydrolysis (20). The absence of CBM3 from the genomes of C. hydrothermalis and C. owensensis, which also lack exo-acting cellulases, indicates that the CBM3 family may be an additional determinant for a Caldicellulosiruptor species' ability to hydrolyze crystalline cellulose.Biomass deconstruction-related GH families present in selected Caldicellulosiruptor spp.Selected CBM families that bind to biomassOther glycoside hydrolases potentially involved in biomass deconstruction were also identified, including those involved in hemicellulose (xylanases, mannanases, and xyloglucanases) and pectin hydrolysis. The genomes of the Caldicellulsiruptor species sequenced collectively contain four out of six described GH families that hydrolyze the β-1,4-xyloside linkages of xylan, three out of four described GH families that hydrolyze the β-1,4-mannoside linkages of mannan, and four out of five described xyloglucanase GH families that hydrolyze the β-1,4-glucan linkages (Table ​(Table2)2) (10). In addition, many different CBM families capable of binding to xylan (Table ​(Table3,3, CBM6, -9, -22, and -36) are present in all Caldicellulosiruptor species, and in the case of C. hydrothermalis and C. lactoaceticus a CBM family (CBM 27) involved in binding to mannan is present (Table ​(Table3).3). All Caldicellulosiruptor species sequenced can hydrolyze the backbone of all three major types of hemicellulose (Table ​(Table2).2). It is interesting that for the above-mentioned cellulase and hemicellulase GH families, only C. kronotskyensis posseses all families collectively present in the genus Caldicellulosiruptor. Having such a wealth of biomass deconstruction-related GH families present in the genome of C. kronotskyensis indicates that it is well suited for CBP, especially when a biomass feedstock contains a range of heteropolysaccharides. In addition, all Caldicellulosiruptor species produce GHs and polysaccharide lyases (PL) capable of degrading galacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan, the two major components of pectin (9). Overall, for hemicellulose- and pectin-degrading enzymes, no two Caldicellulosiruptor species have the same GH/PL profile, indicating that each has evolved a specific strategy for handling complex biomass hydrolysis. This raises the prospect for exploiting this nonredundant biomass-degrading capability in Caldicellulosiruptor species communities for CPB. Additionally, with the discovery of novel multidomain GH enzymes in the draft genome sequences, additional efforts at isolating yet-to-be-discovered Caldicellulosiruptor species are warranted.Although 16S rRNA phylogeny suggests that the members of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor are closely related, experimental data using M-CGH indicated that there is a great deal of genetic diversity on a whole-genome scale across the genus. In fact, the use of M-CGH can be a useful tool for identifying new isolates of Caldicellulosiruptor species. With additional whole-genome sequences becoming available, a genus-wide oligonucleotide microarray could also be designed to quickly identify the presence of desirable genes encoding GHs and CBMs in novel Caldicellulosiruptor isolates (40). When the growth physiologies of Caldicellulosiruptor species were compared, all species were capable of robust growth on pretreated switchgrass biomass, an important characteristic for CBP. Interestingly, all species showed differential abilities to grow on microcrystalline cellulose, the main polysaccharide component of biomass. In addition, differential secretome profiles indicated that each Caldicellulosiruptor species uses a different strategy for interactions with complex polysaccharides and simple sugars in their environment. The production of copious amounts of an S-layer protein from one of the cellulolytic members of the genus also hints at possible noncellulosomal methods of substrate interaction along the cell surface. When preliminary draft genome sequences were searched for enzymes involved in biomass hydrolysis, some of the differential responses to crystalline cellulose appeared to be the result of the presence or lack of GH enzymes involved in cellulose hydrolysis. Cataloging biomass degradation-related GH families from the genus Caldicellulosiruptor provided a preliminary look into the genomic diversity of the genus Caldicellulosiruptor. Further analysis of the roles of biomass-degrading related GH families in the sequenced Caldicellulosiruptor genomes will also help to pair synergistic partners for multispecies CBP. Additional comparative genomics studies are under way that aim to look more comprehensively at the most thermophilic cellulose-hydrolyzing genus discovered to date.We gratefully acknowledge Lynne Goodwin at the DOE Joint Genome Institute and Loren Hauser, Bob Cottingham, and David Graham at ORNL for providing information on the genome sequences of C. hydrothermalis, C. kristjanssonii, C. kronotskyensis, C. lactoaceticus, and C. owensensis.

PMC3008369,Glycomics Hits the Big Time,False,"Cells run on carbohydrates. Glycans, sequences of carbohydrates conjugated to proteins and lipids, are arguably the most abundant and structurally diverse class of molecules in nature. Recent advances in glycomics reveal the scope and scale of their functional roles and their impact on human disease.By analogy to the genome, transcriptome, or proteome, the ‘glycome’ is the complete set of glycans and glycoconjugates that are made by a cell or organism under specific conditions. Therefore, ‘glycomics’ refers to studies that attempt to define or quantify the glycome of a cell, tissue or organism (Bertozzi and Sasisekharan, 2009). In eukaryotes, protein glycosylation generally involves the covalent attachment of glycans to either serine, threonine or asparagine residues. Glycoproteins occur in all cellular compartments. Glycans are also attached to lipids, often ceramide, which is comprised of sphingosine, a hydrocarbon amino alcohol and a fatty acid. Complex glycans are mainly attached to secreted or cell surface proteins and they do not cycle on and off of the polypeptide. In contrast, the monosaccharide O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) cycles rapidly on serine or threonine residues of many nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Identifying the number, structure and function of glycans in cellular biology is a daunting task, but one that's been made easier in recent years by advances in technology and by our growing appreciation of how integral glycans are to biology (Varki et al., 2009).The scope of the glycomics challenge is immense. The covalent addition of glycans to proteins and lipids represents not only the most abundant post-translational modification (PTM), but also by far the most structurally diverse. Although it is commonly stated that over fifty-percent of all polypeptides are covalently modified by glycans (Apweiler et al., 1999), even this estimate is far too low, since it fails to include that myriad nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins are modified by O-GlcNAc (Hart et al., 2007). Even though the generic term, ‘glycosylation’ is often used to categorize and lump all glycan modifications of proteins into one bin, side-by-side with other post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, or methylation, such a view is not only inaccurate, but also is completely misleading. If one only considers the linkage of the first glycan to the polypeptide in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, there are at least thirteen different monosaccharides and eight different amino acids involved in glycoprotein linkages, with a total of at least forty-one different chemical bonds known to be linking the glycan to the protein (Spiro, 2002). Importantly, each one of these unique glycan:protein linkages is surely as different both in structure and function as protein methylation is from acetylation.Of course, this modification is not only about a single linkage. When structural diversity of the additional oligosaccharide branches of glycans and the added diversity of complex terminal saccharides on glycans, such as fucose or sialic acids (about fifty different sialic acids are known (Schauer, 2009)), are taken into account, the molecular diversity and varied functions of protein-bound glycans rapidly increase exponentially. Just the ‘sialome’ (Cohen and Varki, 2010) rivals or exceeds many other post-translational modifications in abundance and structural/functional diversity. In addition, chemical modifications, such as phosphorylation, sulfation and acetylation increase the glycan structural/functional diversity even more. Thus, categorizing ‘glycosylation’ as a single type of post-translational modification is neither useful nor at all reflective of reality.Glyconjugates provide dynamic structural diversity to proteins and lipids that is responsive to cellular phenotype, metabolic state and to the developmental stage of cells. Complex glycans play critical roles in intercellular and intracellular processes, which are fundamentally important to the development of multicellularity (Figure 1). Unlike nucleic acids and proteins, glycan structures are not hardwired into the genome, depending upon a template for their synthesis. Rather the glycan structures that end up on a polypeptide or lipid result from the concerted actions of highly-specific glycosyltransferases (Lairson et al., 2008), which in-turn are dependent upon the concentrations and localization of high-energy nucleotide sugar donors, such as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, the endpoint of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, the glycoforms of a glycoprotein depend upon many factors directly tied to both gene expression and cellular metabolism.Complex glycans at the cell surface are targets of microbes and viruses, regulate cell adhesion and development, influence metastasis of cancer cells, and regulate myriad receptor:ligand interactions. Glycans within the secretory pathway regulate protein quality control, turnover, and trafficking of molecules to organelles. Nucleocytoplasmic O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) has extensive crosstalk with phosphorylation to regulate signaling, cytoskeletal functions and gene expression in response to nutrients and stress.There are at-least two hundred and fifty glycosyltransferases in the human genome, and it has been estimated that about two-percent of the human genome encodes proteins involved in glycan biosynthesis, degradation or transport (Schachter and Freeze, 2009). Biosynthesis of the nucleotide sugar donors is directly regulated by nucleic acid, glucose and energy metabolism, and the compartmentalization of these nucleotide sugar donors is highly regulated by specific transporters. Protein glycosylation is therefore controlled by rates of polypeptide translation and protein folding, localization of and competition between glycosyltransferases, cellular concentration and localization of nucleotide sugars, the localization of glycosidases, and by membrane trafficking. Thus, individual glycosylation sites on the same polypeptide can contain different glycan structures that reflect both the type and status of the cell in which they are synthesized. For example, the glycoforms of the membrane protein Thy-1, are very different in lymphocytes than they are in brain, despite having the same polypeptide sequence (Rudd and Dwek, 1997). Conversely, even small changes in polypeptide sequence or structure will alter the types of glycan structures attached to a polypeptide. For example, histocompatiblility antigen polypeptides with over ninety-percent sequence homology contain different N-linked glycan profiles at individual sites, reflective of their allelic type, even when they are synthesized within the same cells (Swiedler et al., 1985). Thus, site-specific protein glycosylation is highly regulated by gene expression of glycan processing enzymes, by polypeptide structure at all levels, and by cellular metabolism.A detailed understanding of cellular processes will require a detailed appreciation of the glycans modulating proteins and pathways. Although this ultimate goal of glycomics is laudable, we are a very long way from having the technology to completely characterize the glycome of even a simple cell or tissue. Not only is the glycome much more complex than the genome, transcriptome or proteome, as noted above, it is also much more dynamic, varying considerably not only with cell type but also with the developmental stage and metabolic state of a cell. Even very conservative estimates indicate that there are well over a million different glycan structures in a mammalian cell's glycome. However, upon considering ‘functional glycomics’, it is estimated that the binding sites of glycan binding proteins (GBPs), such as antibodies, lectins, receptors, toxins, microbial adhesions or enzymes (Figure 1) can accommodate only up to two to six monosaccharides within a glycan structure (Cummings, 2009). Therefore, the number of specific glycan sub-structures that bind to biologically important GBPs in a cell may be fewer than ten thousand, a number within the realm of current analytical and, if targeted, chemical or enzymatic synthetic capabilities.Until recently, the lack of tools and the inherent complexity of glycans have been major barriers preventing most biologists from embracing the importance of glycans in biology. Recent technological advances have significantly lowered these barriers. Indeed, the tools of glycomics, and the subfields of glycoproteomics, glycolipidomics and proteoglycomics have all progressed substantially in recent years (Krishnamoorthy and Mahal, 2009; Laremore et al., 2010). Major technological advances, many of which are shared with proteomics, have recently allowed semi-quantitative profiling of glycans and glycoproteins (Krishnamoorthy and Mahal, 2009; Vanderschaeghe et al., 2010). Some of these advances are the result of the National Institute of General Medical Science's (NIGMS) support of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG), which has served to focus and assist over five hundred researchers on issues related to glycomics (Paulson et al., 2006; Raman et al., 2006).Kobata and colleagues were amongst the first to profile N-glycans, well before the current concepts of ‘glycomics’ were conceived. Despite the lack of many modern methods, their pioneering work was characterized by a high level of rigor in defining the arrays of N-glycan structures present in cells, tissues and on specific proteins (Endo, 2010). Currently, a wide variety of high-resolution and highly sensitive methods are available, including capillary electrophoresis (CE), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and lectin microarrays.Glycans are often profiled after their release from polypeptides, which results in the loss of any information about proteins and sites to which they were attached. Even though it is much more difficult, it is also much preferable to perform glycopeptide profiling (glycoproteomics) to first identify attachment sites prior to detailed profiling or structural analysis of the glycans present on a polypeptide. The ultimate goal of glycoproteomics, which is to define all of the molecular species (glycoforms) of glycoproteins in a cell or tissue, has not yet been realized for any glycoprotein with more than one glycan attachment site. N-glycans are generally released from proteins by peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which cleaves most, but not all N-glycans. Unfortunately, no such broadly specific enzyme exists for O-glycans, which are generally released by chemical methods, such as alkali-induced β-elimination or by hydrazinolysis. However, for relatively pure glycoproteins, so called ‘top-down’ mass spectrometric methods, which do not involve prior release of the glycans, may eventually prove useful, as instrumentation and methods improve (Reid et al., 2002).Due to the small sample sizes involved, most CE or HPLC separation methods require chemical modification of released glycans with fluorescent compounds. CE and HPLC methods provide high-resolution separation of glycans, and when combined with laser induced fluorescent detection (LIF), tagged-glycans can be detected in the low femtomole range. High pH anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) with pulsed-amperiometric detection separates glycans with high resolution and detects them with high sensitivity without chemical modification, but the high alkalinity employed can be problematic for some labile structures.Lectins, which are defined as carbohydrate binding proteins that are neither antibodies nor enzymes, have a wide range of glycan binding specificities, suitable for partial characterization of a glycome. Lectin microarrays use methods and equipment similar to that employed for nucleic acid arrays. Given the large number of different lectins available, lectin microarrays can provide information about the glycome in a high-throughput fashion, which is particularly useful in profiling glycans produced by infectious organisms (Hsu et al., 2006). In the future, it is highly likely that glycomics will play a central role in combating infectious disease. However, many technical issues remain to be resolved, such as standardization required for clinical use, the development of purified recombinant lectins, and better definition of the specificities of many lectins (Gupta et al., 2010).Both matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and electrospray mass spectrometry have played a key role in glycan profiling and in glycoproteomics (An et al., 2009; North et al., 2010; Zaia, 2010). For biomarker discovery, affinity enrichment approaches, based upon chemical modification and solid-phase extraction of N-linked glycoproteins, have proven useful in profiling N-linked glycoprotein sites from serum or even from paraffin embedded tissues (Tian et al., 2009). Recently, using lectin binding, combined with advanced mass spectrometric methods, thousands of N-glycan attachment sites have been mapped, a prerequisite for understanding their functions (Zielinska et al., 2010).Given the structural diversity of glycans, all of these glycomic approaches generate vast amounts of data. Glycan bioinformatics has made great strides within recent years with major efforts from several laboratories (Aoki-Kinoshita, 2008). At least four major publicly available carbohydrate databases (Glycosciences.de, KEGG GLYCAN, EurocarbDB and CFG) are now maintained, and efforts to structure them in a uniform format have been in progress for quite some time. In addition, the Carbohydrate-Active EnZyme database, (CAZy) has played a key role in providing a global understanding of carbohydrate active enzymes, documenting their evolutionary relationships, providing a framework for elucidating common mechanisms, and for establishing the relationship between glycogenomics and glycomes expressed by cells (Cantarel et al., 2009). Moreover, recent advances in bioinformatic analysis tools for complex glycomic mass spectrometry data sets have allowed complex data to be presented in formats useful to non-experts in all fields of biology (Ceroni et al., 2008; Goldberg et al., 2005)Perhaps one of the most important contributions to the field of functional glycomics has been the development of well-defined glycan microarrays, which currently display over five-hundred different glycan structures (Smith et al., 2010). The NIGMS supported Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) has generated and made publicly available custom-made DNA microarrays that represent glycosyltransferases and glycan binding proteins. The CFG also has developed databases that present phenotypic and biochemical data on glycosyltransferase knock-out mice. Even though knocking out a single glycosyltransferase gene often affects hundreds of glycoconjugates and myriad biological processes, these mutant mice have proven valuable in revealing the fundamental biological importance of glycans. The microarrays and the databases produced by the CFG member community at-large are publically available on the CFG web site (http://www.functionalglycomics.org), and have resulted in a profound increase in our understanding of the binding specificities of GBPs, including lectins key to inflammation and immunity, and on infectious microbes or viruses. However, a major barrier preventing glycan biology from being incorporated more into the mainstream is the continued failure by the community to adopt a universally standard glycan structural format and database that are easily accessed worldwide. Most importantly, glycan databases must eventually be incorporated into standard interactive databases that are supported by public agencies (such as NCBI or EMBL) before glycan biology can be fully integrated into the wider research community.Glycans are directly involved in almost every biological process and certainly play a major role in nearly every human disease (Figure 1). Genetic studies in tissue culture cells indicate that specific complex glycan structures are generally not essential to a cell growing in culture, indicating that most of the functions of complex glycans are at the multicellular level. In contrast, the cycling monosaccharide, O-GlcNAc, on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, is essential even at the single cell level in mammals (Hart et al., 2007).The critical roles of glycans in mammals are now well established not only by the dearth of mutations in glycan biosynthetic enzymes that survive development, but also by the severe phenotypes generated when such mutations are not lethal. These severe phenotypes are clearly illustrated by the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) (Schachter and Freeze, 2009), which are associated with severe mental and developmental abnormalities. Also, the severe muscular dystrophy that results from defective O-glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (Yoshida-Moriguchi et al., 2010), further illustrates how a mutation in a glycan biosynthetic enzyme results in a devastating disease. The interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins plays a key role in the etiology of diabetes, neurodegenerative disease and cancer (Hart et al., 2007; Zeidan and Hart, 2010).It has long been appreciated that alterations in cell surface glycans contribute to the metastastatic and neoplastic properties of tumor cells (Taniguchi, 2008). The functions of many receptors are modulated by their glycans such as modulation of Notch receptors by the action of specific glycosyltransferases (Moloney et al., 2000), which regulate Notch's activation by its ligands, affecting many developmental events. Selectins, which specifically bind to a subset of fucosylated and sialylated glycans, play a critical role in leukocyte homing to sites of inflammation. Indeed, a selectin inhibitor is currently in phase 2 clinical trials for vaso-occlusive sickle cell disease (Chang et al., 2010). Siglecs, which are a family of cell surface sialic acid binding lectins, play a fundamental role in regulating lymphocyte functions and activation. Recent studies on galectins, a family of β-galactoside binding lectins, have shown that they play a critical role in the organization of receptors on the cell surface, and play important roles in immunity, infections, development and inflammation (Lajoie et al., 2009). Proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans play a key role in regulation of growth factors, in microbial binding, in tissue morphogenesis and in the etiology of cardiovascular disease. Proteoglycans are perhaps the most complicated and information rich molecules in biology, and progress in proteoglycomics has begun to accelerate (Ly et al., 2010). Nearly all microbes and viruses that infect humans bind to cells by attaching to specific cell surface glycans. Glycomics and glycan arrays will have a substantial impact upon future research toward both diagnosing and preventing infectious disease.Some of the most important drugs on the market are already the result of glycomics. The anti-flu virus drugs, Relenza™ and Tamiflu™ are structural analogs of sialic acids that inhibit the flu virus neuraminidase and the transmission of the virus. Natural heparin, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan, and chemically defined synthetic heparin oligosaccharides, have long been widely used in the clinic as anticoagulants and for many other clinical uses. Hyaluronic acid, a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan, is used in the treatment of arthritis. Many recombinant pharmaceuticals, including therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, are glycoproteins, and their specific glycoforms are key to their bio-activity and half lives in circulation, and to their possible induction of deleterious immune responses when they do not contain the correct glycans. Given this landscape, the pharmaceutical industry and the US Food and Drug Administration are rapidly realizing the critical importance, both in terms of bioactivity and safety, of carefully defining the glycoforms of any therapeutics derived from glycoconjugates.Clinical cancer diagnostic markers are often glycoproteins, but most current diagnostic tests only measure the expression of the polypeptide. Clearly, given the long known alterations in glycans associated with cancer, it is highly likely that cancer markers that detect specific glycoforms of a protein will have much higher sensitivity and specificity for early detection of cancer (Packer et al., 2008; Taniguchi, 2008). Thus, the convergence of glycomics and glycoproteomics is key to the discovery of biomarkers for the early detection of cancer (Taylor et al., 2009). Recently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved fucosylated α-fetoprotein as a diagnostic marker of primary hepatocarcinoma. In addition, fucosylated haptoglobin may be a much better marker of pancreatic cancer than simply monitoring the expression of the haptoglobin polypeptide. Indeed, The National Cancer Institute has begun an initiative to discover, develop and clinically validate glycan biomarkers for cancer (http://glycomics.cancer.gov/). System biology analyses of the glycome to identify biomarkers of human disease will by necessity also employ many of the same methods used by genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics (Figure 2) (Packer et al., 2008). Due to the critical roles of glycans in cardiovascular disease, lung disease and in the functions of blood cells, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has recognized an acute need to train more researchers in the area of glycosciences by creating a “Program of Excellence in Glycosciences”, which will not only support collaborative research, but also will provide hands-on laboratory training in the methods of glycosciences to fellows.Given that glycan structures are regulated by metabolism and glyco-enzyme expression, and glycans modify both proteins and lipids, functional glycomics also requires the tools of genomics, proteomics, lipidomics and metabolomics (modified after (Packer et al., 2008).Thus, while our knowledge about the biology of glycans and glycomics continues to lag behind more mainstream fields of genomics and proteomics, technological advances in glycomics in the last five years have begun to accelerate the integration of glycobiology into the other major fields of biomedical research. A complete mechanistic understanding of the etiology of almost any disease will depend upon the elucidation of the functions of all post-translational modifications, but will especially depend upon our understanding the many roles of glycans, the most abundant and structurally diverse type of post-translational modification.We thank Dr. Chad Slawson for helpful suggestions.

PMC3009860,Biosynthetic Origin of the Galactosamine Substituent of Arabinogalactan in Mycobacterium tuberculosis*,False,"The arabinogalactan (AG) of slow growing pathogenic Mycobacterium spp. is characterized by the presence of galactosamine (GalN) modifying some of the interior branched arabinosyl residues. The biosynthetic origin of this substituent and its role(s) in the physiology and/or pathogenicity of mycobacteria are not known. We report on the discovery of a polyprenyl-phospho-N-acetylgalactosaminyl synthase (PpgS) and the glycosyltransferase Rv3779 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis required, respectively, for providing and transferring the GalN substrate for the modification of AG. Disruption of either ppgS (Rv3631) or Rv3779 totally abolished the synthesis of the GalN substituent of AG in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Conversely, expression of ppgS in Mycobacterium smegmatis conferred upon this species otherwise devoid of ppgS ortholog and any detectable polyprenyl-phospho-N-acetylgalactosaminyl synthase activity the ability to synthesize polyprenyl-phospho-N-acetylgalactosamine (polyprenyl-P-GalNAc) from polyprenyl-P and UDP-GalNAc. Interestingly, this catalytic activity was increased 40–50-fold by co-expressing Rv3632, the encoding gene of a small membrane protein apparently co-transcribed with ppgS in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The discovery of this novel lipid-linked sugar donor and the involvement of a the glycosyltransferase C-type glycosyltransferase in its transfer onto its final acceptor suggest that pathogenic mycobacteria modify AG on the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane. The availability of a ppgS knock-out mutant of M. tuberculosis provides unique opportunities to investigate the physiological function of the GalN substituent and the potential impact it may have on host-pathogen interactions.Galactosamine (d-GalN) was recognized as a minor covalently bound amino sugar component of the cell wall of slow growing mycobacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra, Mycobacterium lepraemurium, Mycobacterium microti) as early as in the 1970s (1,–3). Advances in mass spectrometry later coupled with the use of an arabinanase isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis allowed the GalN substituent to be mapped to the arabinogalactan (AG)7 component of the cell wall (3), and more specifically to the C2 position of a portion of the internal 3,5-branched d-Araf residues in the AG of M. tuberculosis (4, 5). d-GalN was estimated to occur at the level of about one residue per entire AG molecule (3,–5). Interestingly, a similar sugar residue was found to substitute the AG of Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium bovis BCG (3) and Mycobacterium leprae,8 but not that of M. smegmatis, M. neoaurum, and M. phlei (3,–5), suggesting that fast growing Mycobacterium spp. are devoid of GalN substituent.The function and biosynthetic origin of this substituent are not known. Non-N-acetylated hexosamine residues, particularly GalN residues, are rather uncommon in prokaryotes. Thus far, they essentially have been described as components of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of some Gram-negative bacteria (6,–9). In Francisella tularensis and subsp. novicida for instance, GalN covalently modifies the lipid A moiety of LPS neutralizing its negative charge and enhancing the virulence of the bacterium in mice (8, 9). In Gram-positive bacteria, GalN and glucosamine (GlcN) have been reported in the glycosylation motif of a glycoprotein toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis and proposed to be important to the biological activities of the toxin (10). GalN was also identified as a possible component of a galactose-containing polysaccharide from Streptococcus mutans (11).Recent studies have partially elucidated the biosynthetic origin of the d-GalN unit modifying the lipid A of Francisella (8, 9, 12). It was shown to originate in the lipid-linked sugar donor, undecaprenyl phosphate-β-d-N-acetylgalactosamine which, upon deacetylation by a specialized deacetylase, yields undecaprenyl phosphate-β-d-galactosamine. This is then used as the d-GalN donor in a glycosyl transfer reaction onto lipid A catalyzed by the membrane-associated glycosyltransferase FlmK (8, 9, 12). This process is reminiscent of that involved in the addition of aminoarabinose to lipid A in enteric bacteria where an enzyme (termed ArnC in Escherichia coli) catalyzes the synthesis of undecaprenyl-phospho-N-formyl-aminoarabinose from UDP-N-formyl-aminoarabinose, and a glycosyltransferase (ArnT in E. coli) catalyzes the transfer of the deformylated aminoarabinose residue from this lipid donor onto lipid A (13).Numerous glycosylation events in the biosynthesis of M. tuberculosis cell wall and other glycoconjugates are known to occur on the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, catalyzed by membrane-associated glycosyltransferases of the GT-C superfamily dependent on decaprenyl-phosphate-linked sugar donors rather than nucleotide-sugar donors (for a review, see Refs. 14,–16). However, to date, the known polyprenyl-based sugar donors of Mycobacterium spp. only include β-d-glucosyl-1-monophosphoryl-decaprenol, β-d-mannosyl-1-monophosphoryl-decaprenol, β-d-ribosyl-1-monophosphoryl-decaprenol, and β-d-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphoryl-decaprenol (17,–19). To the best of our knowledge, polyprenyl-linked galactosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine has never been reported in mycobacteria. This study reports on the discovery of the biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of lipid-linked-d-GalNAc in mycobacteria and subsequent d-GalNAc or d-GalN transfer onto AG.M. tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC 25618 and H37Rv TMC102 were grown in Sauton's and Middlebrook 7H9 medium. M. smegmatis mc2155 was grown in 7H9 or LB medium. Kanamycin (kan) and hygromycin were added to final concentrations of 20 μg ml−1 and 50 μg ml−1, respectively.The Ts/sacB method was used to achieve allelic replacement at the Rv3631 (ppgS) locus of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (20). The ppgS gene and flanking regions was PCR-amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA with primers Rv3631.5 (5′-ttggtacctctagacccgcaccgtggtcg-3′) and Rv3631.6 (5′-ttgaattccagatcaacgcgtcgccc-3′) and a disrupted allele, ppgS::kan, was obtained by inserting the Tn903 kanamycin resistance cassette at the FseI restriction site of ppgS. ppgS::kan was then cloned into the XbaI-cut and blunt-ended pPR27-xylE (20), yielding pPR27ppgSKX. The Rv3779 knock-out mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv TMC102 and complemented mutant strains were described elsewhere (21). The mshB knock-out mutant of M. tuberculosis Erdman (22) was kindly provided by Drs. Fahey and Newton (University of California San Diego), and the mca transposon mutant of M. tuberculosis CDC1551 was obtained from CSU TB Vaccine Testing and Research Materials Contract (National Institutes of Health,NIAID N01-AI-40091).The entire coding sequences of ppgS and Rv3632 were PCR-amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA and cloned into the expression vector pVV16 (23), yielding pVVppgS and pVVRv3632, respectively. pVVppgS-Rv3632 was generated by amplifying the ppgS and Rv3632 ORFs together and cloning the resulting PCR fragment into the same expression plasmid. These constructs allow the constitutive expression of ppgS, Rv3632, or both genes under control of the hsp60 promoter. Primer sequences are available upon request.Membranes from M. smegmatis mc2155 were prepared as described (24) and resuspended in 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.9) (buffer A). The typical reaction mixture for the production of polyprenyl-P-d-[3H]GalNAc from UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc by M. smegmatis membranes contained 0.5 μCi of UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc (specific activity 20 Ci mmol−1; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm NADH, membrane fraction (0.5 mg of proteins), and buffer A in a final volume of 80 μl; thus, the membranes were the source of the endogenous polyprenyl-P acceptors. After incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by addition of 1.2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH (2:1:0.05, v/v). The upper aqueous phase was discarded, and the bottom organic phase was backwashed with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:47:48). The dried organic phase was dissolved in 50 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H2O (65:25:0.5:3.6) prior to TLC analysis on aluminum-backed silica gel 60-precoated plates F254 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).Purified AG (10 μg) was partially degraded by controlled acid hydrolysis (0.1 m HCl for 20 min at 110 °C), and the oligosaccharides liberated were then tagged with the fluorescent probe 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (APTS) as described earlier (25). Labeled oligosaccharides were then analyzed by capillary electrophoresis monitored by laser-induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) on a P/ACE 5000 instrument (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). Separations were performed using an uncoated fused-silica capillary column (Sigma) of 50-μm internal diameter and 40-cm effective length (47-cm total length). Analyses were carried out at a temperature of 25 °C, in the reverse mode, with an applied voltage of 20 kV using 1% acetic acid (w/v)-30 mm triethylamine, pH 3.5, as a running electrolyte (25). Picopreparative CE was performed as described previously (26).Analyses were performed on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (with TOF/TOF optics, Applied Biosystems, Voyager DE-STR) in the reflectron mode. The matrix used was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 μg μl−1 in a mixture of ethanol/water (1:1, v/v)). 0.3 μl of the CE-collected oligosaccharides resuspended in 10 μl of water or TLC-extracted lipids resuspended in 10 μl CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) was mixed with 0.3 μl of the matrix solution. Mass spectra were recorded in the negative mode. The collision-induced dissociation gas type for MS/MS experiments was atmosphere, and the gas pressure was set to medium.Rv3631 (thereafter renamed ppgS) is predicted to encode a GT-A-fold glycosyltransferase (GT) (14, 15) and, according to the Carbohydrate-Active enZymes classification of glycosyltransferases (27), to belong to the GT-2 family of inverting GTs dependent on NDP-sugars as donor substrates. Orthologs of ppgS are found in the genomes of slow growing mycobacteria including M. bovis, M. bovis BCG, M. leprae, Mycobacterium ulcerans, Mycobacterium marinum, M. avium, and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, as well as in Mycobacterium abscessus, but not in the genomes of other rapidly growing Mycobacterium species such as M. smegmatis (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, in all of the genomes analyzed, ppgS and orthologs map in close vicinity to galE1, a gene thought to encode the UDP-glucose 4-epimerase responsible for the conversion of UDP-d-Glcp to UDP-d-Galp in AG synthesis (16). ppgS and orthologs appear to be co-transcribed with a gene potentially encoding a small membrane protein (13 kDa) of unknown function (Rv3632 in M. tuberculosis H37Rv) (supplemental Fig. S1). PpgS shares significant sequence similarities with polyprenyl-monophosphomannose synthases from various prokaryotic sources, including Ppm1 (Rv2051c) from M. tuberculosis H37Rv (24% identity, 39% similarity on a 228-amino acid overlap).To investigate the putative involvement of this GT in AG synthesis, the ppgS gene from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was disrupted by homologous recombination using the Ts/sacB method (20). Allelic replacement at the ppgS locus was confirmed by Southern hybridization (supplemental Fig. S2A). The mutant grew similarly to its wild-type (WT) H37Rv parent in 7H9-ADC-Tween 80 broth at 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S2B).Soluble AG was prepared from the WT and mutant strains as described previously (5), and the Ara/Gal ratios were determined by CE or GC upon total acid hydrolysis. No significant differences between WT and mutant strains were observed, indicating that PpgS was probably not involved in the polymerization of the arabinan or galactan domains. Because the distribution of ppgS within the Mycobacterium genus seemed to correlate with that of d-GalN on AG, we decided to probe the mutant for the presence of this substituent. To this end, a fast and sensitive CE-based methodology was first developed to facilitate the detection of this rare substituent. By analogy to the procedure that we previously developed to analyze the mannose caps of lipoarabinomannan (25, 28), we postulated that a controlled mild acid hydrolysis of AG would cleave the arabinofuranosidic bonds of the arabinan domain while preserving the pyranosidic linkage of d-GalN onto the relevant Araf unit, thereby releasing an oligosaccharide that could be detected by CE-LIF upon tagging with an APTS fluorescent probe. A typical electrophoretogram of M. tuberculosis H37Rv AG resulting from this analysis is shown in Fig. 1A. The monosaccharide region is dominated by two main peaks attributed to d-Araf-APTS (I) and d-Galp-APTS (II) arising from the hydrolysis of the arabinan and galactan domains. A third peak (III) of lower intensity was detected with a migration time matching that of a maltoheptaose-APTS, tentatively attributed to an oligosaccharide-APTS containing d-GalpN and d-Araf units. This assumption was confirmed by collecting peak III in a picopreparative CE step (26) and subjecting it to MALDI/MS analysis (Fig. 1B). The negative MALDI mass spectrum was dominated by a peak at m/z 882.9 attributed to deprotonated molecular ions [M−H]− that could be assigned to an APTS derivative containing two pentosyl and one hexos-aminyl units. The identity of these units as two arabinosyl and one galactosaminyl residues was revealed by CE analysis upon acid hydrolysis and labeling with APTS or fluorescein-succinimidyl ester. The exact trisaccharide sequence, d-GalN-(1→2)-α-d-Araf-(1→5)-α-d-Araf, was revealed by MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1C) showing fragment ions at m/z 721.8 (y2) and m/z 589.7 (y1) arising from the loss of anhydro-d-GalNp and anhydro-d-GalNp-Araf, and based on the described structure of AG (5) (see also Fig. 6). Peak III was thus further used as a reporter peak for the presence of d-GalN on AG.Arabinogalactan composition of the ppgS knock-out mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv.

The detailed structure of a d-GalN residue modifying an arabinan chain of AG is shown. The trisaccharide moiety of compound III is in bold font. Also shown are the two predicted GT-C signature motifs of Rv3779. GT-C1 (DLD at position 86) located on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane is involved in the transfer of a mannose residue from GDP-α-d-Manp to polyprenyl phosphate (21); GT-C2 (DLD at position 536) is predicted to be in the last extracytoplasmic loop of the protein and to catalyze the transfer of d-GalN(Ac) onto AG.Suggestive of an involvement of PpgS in the formation of the GalN substituent of AG, peak III was noticeably absent from the electrophoretogram of H37RvΔppgS::kan but restored in the complemented mutant strain H37RvΔppgS::kan/pVVppgS. Corroborating this observation, peak III was also detected in the AG of several ppgS-expressing Mycobacterium species (M. bovis BCG, M. marinum, and M. abscessus) but, as expected, was missing from that of M. smegmatis (supplemental Fig. S3). Although PpgS shares significant sequence similarities with polyprenol-monophosphomannose synthases, no significant differences were found between the mannolipid and lipoglycan (lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan) contents of the WT and mutant strains (supplemental Fig. S4).The absence of a ppgS ortholog in M. smegmatis provided a convenient mycobacterial host for the heterologous expression and functional characterization of this gene. Transformation of mc2155 with pVVppgS, the plasmid used for complementation studies in M. tuberculosis, resulted in the production of a C-terminal His6-tagged recombinant protein of the expected size (∼26 kDa) (Fig. 2, A and B). The recombinant protein was almost exclusively found in the membrane and P60 fractions of the bacterium, suggestive of its association with membranes (supplemental Fig. S5). To optimize the chances of producing an active form of PpgS in M. smegmatis, a recombinant strain of M. smegmatis expressing ppgS in combination with Rv3632 and a control strain expressing Rv3632 alone were also constructed. In all cases, recombinant strains grew similarly to the control in liquid broth and the production of recombinant proteins of the expected sizes was confirmed (Fig. 2B).Production of recombinant forms of PpgS and Rv3632 in M. smegmatis mc2155. The production of a recombinant C-terminal His6-tagged form of PpgS from M. tuberculosis was detected by Coomassie Blue staining (A) and Western blot using a monoclonal anti-His tag antibody (B) in the mc2155/pVVppgS strain (lanes 3) but not in the control strain, mc2155/pVV16 (lanes 1). The production of a recombinant C-terminal His6-tagged form of Rv3632 from M. tuberculosis was detected by Western blotting (B) in the mc2155/pVVRv3632 strain (lanes 2) and mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632 strain (lanes 4) but not in the control strain, mc2155/pVV16 (lanes 1).Analysis of the AG of the various recombinant strains as described above failed to reveal the presence of a d-GalNp (or N-acetyl-d-GalNp) substituent on the AG of mc2155/pVV16, mc2155/pVVppgS, mc2155/pVVRv3632, and mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632 (supplemental Fig. S6). It thus appeared that the expression of ppgS alone or in combination with Rv3632 was not sufficient for the formation of this substituent in M. smegmatis.Cell-free assays using membranes from the recombinant M. smegmatis strains were then conducted to determine whether PpgS is involved in some aspects of lipid-linked sugar biosynthesis. TLC autoradiographs clearly revealed the incorporation of d-[3H]GalNAc from UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc into two major glycolipids (A and B) by mc2155/pVVppgS membranes that were not detected in the control strain mc2155/pVV16 or in the strain expressing the only Rv3632 gene, mc2155/pVVRv3632 (Fig. 3A). Strikingly, this enzymatic activity was increased 40–50-fold in the strain co-expressing ppgS and Rv3632 (Fig. 3A, lane 4). The accumulated d-[3H]GalNAc- (or d-[3H]GalN)-containing glycolipids were mild alkali-stable and mild acid-labile (supplemental Fig. 7SA) with TLC mobility properties suggestive of lipid-linked sugars of the mycobacterial polyisoprenyl-P class (19, 21, 29). Further assays aimed at testing the effects of time and protein or acceptor substrate concentration on d-[3H]GalNAc transfer by mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632 membranes showed clear enzyme and substrate concentration-dependent increases in activity (Fig. 3, B and C). Increases in activity were similar whether decaprenyl (C50)-P or the shorter heptaprenyl (C35)-P were used as acceptor substrates (Fig. 3D) but inexistent when C10-P served as the acceptor (supplemental Fig. S7B) indicative of PpgS preference for longer lipid carriers. Suggestive of PpgS specificity for the sugar transferred, assays performed under similar conditions using other sugar donors including GDP-d-[14C]Man, UDP-d-[14C]GlcNAc, ADP-d-[14C]Glc, and UDP- d-[14C]Gal failed to reveal any effect of overexpressing ppgS on the incorporation of these radiolabeled sugars into glycolipids (data not shown).Effect of overexpressing ppgS alone and in combination with Rv3632 on the incorporation of d-[3H]GalNAc from UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc into lipid-linked sugars by membrane extracts from M. smegmatis. A, TLC analysis of an in vitro cell-free assay using UDP-[3H]-α-d-GalNAc and membranes from mc2155/pVV16 (lane 1), mc2155/pVVppgS (lane 2), mc2155/pVVRv3632 (lane 3), and mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632 (lane 4). The synthesized lipid-linked sugars were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH (2:1:0.05, v/v), and a 10% aliquot of each sample was analyzed by TLC in the solvent system CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H2O (65:25:0.5:3.6, v/v) followed by autoradiography. The radiolabeled products migrating close to the origin in all assays were identified by co-migration as C50-P-P-d-GlcNAc (GL-1) and C50-P-P-d-GlcNAc-Rha (GL-2) and probably arose from the randomization of UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc into UDP-α-d-[3H]GlcNAc which is known to serve as a donor substrate in the initial steps of the biosynthesis of AG (15). B, percentage incorporation of d-[3H]GalNAc into polyprenyl-P-d-GalNAc over time by membranes of mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632 as a function of the amount of membrane proteins used in the assay. Triangles, 0.5 μg of protein; squares, 5 μg; diamonds, 50 μg. C, incorporation of d-[3H]GalNAc into polyprenyl-P-d-GalNAc over time by membranes of mc2155/pVV16 (open symbols) and mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632 (filled symbols) as a function of the concentration of C50-P present in the assay mixture. Squares, 250 μm C50-P; diamonds, 25 μm C50-P; circles, 2.5 μm C50-P; stars, no added acceptor substrate. D, TLC analysis of in vitro cell-free assays using UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc and membranes from mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632, in the presence or absence of added acceptor substrates (C35-P and C50-P). Assays were run and analyzed as in A.To establish the nature of the products formed in the assay using mc2155/pVVppgS-Rv3632 membranes and UDP-α-d-[3H]GalNAc, a nonradioactive assay was up-scaled, and the products of the reaction, purified by preparative TLC, were submitted to MALDI/MS analyses. The negative MALDI-TOF mass spectra of purified products A and B were dominated by peaks at m/z 980.5 and 784.4, respectively, attributed to deprotonated molecular ions [M−H]− that could be assigned to C50-P-d-GalNAc and C35-P-d-GalNAc (Fig. 4, A and B). This assignment was confirmed by MS/MS analyses showing for compound A fragment ions at m/z 300.5 and 778.2, arising from the loss of the decaprenyl and N-acetylgalactosaminyl moieties, respectively (Fig. 4C). The negative MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrum of purified compound B exhibited the same reporter fragment ions at m/z 300.5 and 581.1 (Fig. 4D). Altogether, our results thus indicate that ppgS encodes a polyprenyl-phospho-N-acetylgalactosaminyl synthase required for the synthesis of the GalN substituent of AG.Structural characterization of products A and B by MALDI/MS.

C and D, negative MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectra of product A (C) and product B (D). *, matrix ions; **, [M−H]− ions from contaminating C50-P-d-GalNAc.Because the involvement of a lipid-linked d-GalN(Ac) donor suggested that the transfer of the amino sugar onto AG occurred on the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane, we thought to search for the responsible GT among the membrane-associated GT-C enzymes of M. tuberculosis (14). Of the 17 proposed GT-Cs of strain H37Rv, only 2 are missing an ortholog in M. smegmatis mc2155 but have orthologs in M. leprae, M. abscessus, and other species harboring a d-GalNp substituent on AG, namely Rv1635c and Rv3779. Rv1635c was demonstrated earlier to catalyze the addition of the first mannose residue in the Man-capping of mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (30). Rv3779 clusters on the chromosome of M. tuberculosis with genes involved in the biosynthesis of the cell wall core and was recently found to participate in the synthesis of polyprenylphosphomannose (21). Analysis of the AG of mutants deficient in the expression of each of these genes (21, 30) revealed that although the M. tuberculosis CDC1551 Rv1635c knock-out strain still carried the d-GalNp substituent (supplemental Fig. S8A), the AG of M. tuberculosis H37RvΔRv3779 was totally devoid of it (Fig. 5). Production of galactosaminylated AG was restored in the Rv3779 mutant upon complementation with a WT copy of Rv3779 expressed from a replicative plasmid (Fig. 5).Arabinogalactan composition of a Rv3779 knock-out mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. CE-LIF analysis of the AG prepared from M. tuberculosis H37Rv wild-type (trace 1), the Rv3779 knock-out mutant (trace 2), and the complemented mutant strain, H37RvΔRv3779/pVVRv3779 (trace 3). I, d-Araf-APTS; II, d-Galp-APTS; III, d-GalNp-d-Araf-d-Araf-APTS.The presence of a covalently bound GalN residue typifies the AG of slow growing mycobacteria. We have identified the key components of the biosynthetic machinery required for the synthesis and transfer of this amino sugar in M. tuberculosis and provided evidence that a previously unknown mycobacterial lipid-linked sugar, polyprenyl-P-(N-acetyl)-galactosamine served as the sugar donor in this process. PpgS, a sugar nucleotide-utilizing GT, catalyzes the formation of polyprenyl (C35/C50)-P-d-GalNAc from UDP-α-d-GalNAc and polyprenyl-P on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane. This sugar donor is then presumably deacylated by an as yet unknown deacetylase before or after being translocated to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane where the membrane-associated GT-C enzyme Rv3779 transfers the d-GalNp (or d-GalNAc) residue from polyprenyl-P-d-GalN(Ac) to the C2 position of a portion of the internal 3,5-branched d-Araf residues of AG (Fig. 6). The identity of the enzymes involved and deduced compartmentalization of this biosynthetic pathway are in line with what is currently known of the biogenesis of AG, whose early biosynthetic steps take place on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane whereas later stages leading to the elongation and branching of the arabinan domain occur extracytoplasmically (16). The distribution of the ppgS, Rv3632, and Rv3779 genes within the Mycobacterium genus matches the reported presence or absence of a d-GalNp substituent on the AG of the mycobacterial species analyzed to date.The identification of the PPM synthase Rv3779 (21) as the galactosaminyltransferase (or N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) of the system indicates that this GT-C enzyme is endowed with at least two distinct enzymatic activities and highlights the complexity of the GT-C enzymes responsible for much of the biosynthesis of mycobacterial cell wall polysaccharides. Consistent with this finding, in addition to the cytoplasmic GT-C signature motif (DLD at position 86) which we proposed earlier to be involved in the transfer of a mannose residue from GDP-α-d-Manp to polyprenyl phosphate (14, 21), a second putative GT-C motif predicted to be located in the last extracytoplasmic loop of the protein (TMHMM 2.0) and susceptible of catalyzing the transfer of d-GalN(Ac) was identified (DLD at position 536). This motif and associated downstream acidic, aromatic, and proline residues (YDYP at position 578) (14) are conserved among the Mycobacterium species reported to display a GalN-substituted AG. The predicted spatial distribution of each GT-C motif, which is in line with that of their respective donor and acceptor substrates (cytosolic GDP-Man and periplasmic arabinan chains of AG in particular), would thus govern the dual catalytic activities of Rv3779 (Fig. 6). Further experiments are under way to validate this hypothesis.Missing biosynthetic components required for producing the GalN substituent of AG include the deacetylase responsible for deacetylating polyprenyl-P-d-GalNAc to the corresponding d-GalN derivative and the translocase required for translocating polyprenyl-P-d-GalN/polyprenyl-P-d-GalNAc from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (Fig. 6). A search for the missing deacetylase of the system in the genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv led to our interest in Rv1170 (mshB) and Rv1082 (mca). MshB participates in the deacetylation of 1-d-myo-inosityl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside in the biosynthesis of mycothiols and, in vitro, displays deacetylase activity on various other acetylated substrates. The mycothiol S-conjugate amidase Mca shares with MshB sequence similarities and deacetylase activity in vitro, although its primary function in the bacterium is the cleavage of various S-conjugates of mycothiol (22, 31, 32). Analysis of AG in the M. tuberculosis mshB and mca knock-out strains, however, revealed WT profiles in both mutants (supplemental Fig. S8B), suggesting either that these enzymes are not involved in the formation of the d-GalNp substituent or that compensatory enzymatic activities exist in the cell.With regard to the translocase of the system, studies are in progress in our laboratories to investigate whether the small integral membrane protein Rv3632 may assume this function, thereby explaining its tight functional association with PpgS. Alternatively, the role of Rv3632 may be to target PpgS to the plasma membrane as shown for GTs involved in O-polysaccharide synthesis in Gram-negative bacteria (33) or to stabilize PpgS in the membrane as suggested for M. smegmatis polyprenyl phosphomannose synthase Ppm1 and associated transmembrane protein Ppm2 (fused as one single polypeptide, Rv2051c, in M. tuberculosis H37Rv) (34).The availability of a ppgS knock-out mutant of M. tuberculosis now provides a unique opportunity to elucidate the function(s) of the d-GalNp substituent of AG. Preliminary studies indicate that the mutant does not display any defects in growth or susceptibility to drugs under optimal laboratory growth conditions. Thus, it is unlikely that d-GalNp serves a critical role in stabilizing the structure of the envelope as suggested earlier (3). Instead, the relative restriction of this substituent to pathogenic slow growing mycobacterial species (and emerging nosocomial pathogen, M. abscessus) together with the reported role of the d-GalN substituent of lipid A in the pathogenicity of F. tularensis (8) make it tempting to speculate that the d-GalNp substituent of AG serves a function during host infection. In vivo studies have been undertaken to verify this hypothesis.We thank A. Noguera (IPBS) for technical assistance and Dr. M.

PMC3012971,Processivity of Cellobiohydrolases Is Limited by the Substrate*,False,"Processive cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) are the key components of fungal cellulase systems. Despite the wealth of structural data confirming the processive mode of action, little quantitative information on the processivity of CBHs is available. Here, we developed a method for measuring cellulase processivity. Sensitive fluorescence detection of enzyme-generated insoluble reducing groups on cellulose after labeling with diaminopyridine enabled quantification of the number of reducing-end exo-mode and endo-mode initiations. Both CBHs TrCel7A from Trichoderma reesei and PcCel7D from Phanerochaete chrysosporium employed reducing-end exo- and endo-mode initiation in parallel. Processivity values measured for TrCel7A and PcCel7D on cellulose hydrolysis were more than an order of magnitude lower than the values of intrinsic processivity that were found from the ratio of catalytic constant (kcat) and dissociation rate constant (koff). We propose that the length of the obstacle-free path available for a processive run on cellulose chain limits the processivity of CBHs on cellulose. TrCel7A and PcCel7D differed in their koff values, whereas the kcat values were similar. Furthermore, the koff values for endoglucanases (EGs) were much higher than the koff values for CBHs, whereas the kcat values for EGs and CBHs were within the same order of magnitude. These results suggest that the value of koff may be the primary target for the selection of cellulases.As a major constituent of plant cell walls, cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on Earth, and it has great potential as a renewable energy source (1,–3). Linear cellulose chains are composed of glucose units linked together through β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. The degree of polymerization (DP)2 in native celluloses ranges from thousands to tens of thousands of glucose units. Cellulose chains interact with each other through hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, forming insoluble crystalline microfibrils and higher order structures. In plant cell walls cellulose microfibrils are in turn associated with other polymers like hemicelluloses and lignin. In nature, cellulose is degraded by microorganisms, mainly fungi and bacteria, that secrete a set of cellulolytic enzymes. Cellulases have been historically divided into exoglucanases or cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) and endoglucanases (EGs). EGs cleave at random positions along the cellulose chain, whereas CBHs processively release cellobiose units from the ends of cellulose chains. The most extensively studied cellulolytic system is that of the soft-rot fungus Trichoderma reesei (Tr) (4). The major component of the Tr cellulolytic system is a glycoside hydrolase family 7 (Ref. 5, see the CAZy database) CBH, TrCel7A (formerly CBH I). Like most cellulases, TrCel7A consists of a catalytic domain connected through a linker peptide with the carbohydrate binding module (6). TrCel7A is a reducing end-acting processive CBH (7, 8). Its active site resides in a 50 Å-long tunnel containing 10 glucose unit binding sites (9, 10). The TrCel7A counterpart in another well characterized cellulolytic organism, the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (Pc) (11), is PcCel7D (formerly CBH 58) (12). PcCel7D is also a reducing end-acting CBH (13, 14). A less abundant CBH produced by Tr is the non-reducing end-acting TrCel6A (formerly CBH II) (15). In addition to two CBHs, Tr also secretes a number of EGs. The most abundant EGs are TrCel7B and TrCel5A. The less abundant EG, TrCel12A, is smaller and does not contain carbohydrate binding module (16).Efficient degradation of cellulose requires synergistic cooperation of CBHs and EGs. The major components of most of the cellulolytic systems are processive CBHs that are responsible for the degradation of crystalline cellulose (17). EGs are expressed in smaller amounts, and they serve to assist CBHs by generating new chain ends on cellulose. However, it has been recognized for some time now that the differentiation of cellulases into EGs and CBHs is an oversimplification; cellulases have evolved to a continuum of overlapping modes of action ranging from totally random EGs through processive EGs to strictly exo-acting highly processive CBHs (17). The exact roles of individual enzymes with different degrees of processivity and endo-activity in cellulose degradation are not known.Processivity is an important characteristic of polymer active enzymes (18). However, the lack of methods for measurement of cellulase processivity has been a major obstacle in elucidation of the costs and benefits of processivity in cellulose degradation (19, 20). Most of the information on the processivity of glycoside hydrolases has been derived from the structures of the enzymes and is qualitative. Enzymes that contain more monomer unit binding sites and have more closed active site topology are thought to be more processive (21). Information on the processivity of CBHs has also been derived from microscopy studies of residual polymers after treatment with enzyme (22, 23). Direct observation of processive movement of TrCel7A on cellulose has also been reported (8). Quantitative measurements of the processivity of glycoside hydrolases have been complicated by the heterogeneous and ill-defined nature of the substrates (20). For cellulases and chitinases, attempts have been made to quantify the processivity using the ratio of released soluble sugars and reducing end-groups generated to the insoluble substrate (24,–30). This approach is strictly applicable only for enzymes that employ an endo-processive mode of action. The pattern of the released soluble products (cellobiose to glucose ratio) has also been used as an indication of the processivity of CBHs (12, 29, 31). Numerical estimates of processivity published for cellulases and chitinases range from 5 to 25 (12, 24,–31). Whether the relatively low processivity values reflect the properties of the enzyme or the substrate or the limitations in methodology used to measure the processivity is not known.In this study we developed a method for quantitative determination of the processivity of cellulases. Processivity of CBHs was found to be dependent on the nature of the substrate. Processivity values measured for CBHs on cellulose were much lower than the processivity values calculated from the ratio of catalytic constant (kcat) and dissociation rate constant (koff).Anthranilic acid (AA), glucose, cellobiose, sodium borohydride, and 2,6-diaminopyridine (DAP) (Aldrich D2,440-4) were purchased from Sigma. Sodium cyanoborohydride and 2,2′-biquinoline-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid disodium salt hydrate (BCA) were from Fluka. d-[U-14C] glucose with specific activity of 262 mCi mmol−1 was from Hartmann Analytic GmbH. DAP was further purified using vacuum sublimation. All other chemicals were used as purchased.TrCel7A, TrCel5A, and TrCel12A were purified from the culture filtrate of Tr QM 9414 as described previously (32,–34). PcCel7D was purified from the culture filtrate of the Pc strain K3 as previously reported (35). Enzyme concentration was determined from absorbance at 280 nm using molar extinction coefficients of 84,400 (14), 74,900 (14), 78,000, and 38,200 m−1 cm−1 for TrCel7A, PcCel7D, TrCel5A, and TrCel12A, respectively.Bacterial cellulose (BC) was prepared by laboratory fermentation of the Acetobacter xylinum strain ATCC 53582 (14). Amorphous cellulose (AC) (prepared from Whatman no. 1 filter paper) and reduced cellulose were prepared as described previously (14). For preparation of DAP-cellulose, DAP labeling was performed in 50 ml total volume. Cellulose concentration was 3.5 g liter−1, and other conditions were as described in the determination of insoluble reducing groups (IRGs) with DAP labeling.SRGs were determined with a modified bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (14, 36). Supernatant (0.5 ml) from cellulose hydrolysis was mixed with 0.5 ml of BCA reagent and heated at 75 °C for 30 min. Concentration of SRGs was found from the absorbance at 560 nm, and cellobiose was used for calibration. For zero data points, supernatants after centrifugation of cellulose suspensions without cellulases were used. At low cellulase concentrations used in this study, the concentration of free cellulase was negligible, and cellulases were omitted from the zero data points for SRGs.IRGs were determined using fluorescence labeling with DAP (for CBHs) or AA (for EGs). After hydrolysis with cellulase, the residual cellulose was washed with 0.2 m NaOH. All cellulose washings were performed through centrifugation (1 min, 10,000 × g) and re-suspension steps. Cellulose was further washed with proteinase K buffer (2% SDS in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5). Proteinase K and CaCl2 were added to the final concentrations of 40 μg ml−1 and 1 mm, respectively, and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. After proteinase K treatment the cellulose was washed with water, and the volume of suspension was adjusted to 0.1 ml. For DAP labeling, 0.4 ml DAP reagent was added to 0.1 ml of the above-described cellulose suspension in water. DAP reagent was prepared freshly by dissolving DAP and sodium cyanoborohydride in buffered methanol (4% sodium acetate trihydrate and 2% boric acid in methanol) (37). Final concentrations of cellulose, DAP, and sodium cyanoborohydride were 2 g liter−1, 75 mm, and 0.5 m, respectively. After 3 h at 80 °C the DAP-labeled cellulose was thoroughly washed with water and 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. DAP-cellulose was completely solubilized by the mixture of Tr cellulases (Celluclast 1.5L) before the measurement of fluorescence. After suitable dilution with 0.5 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, the fluorescence was recorded using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorimeter using excitation and emission wavelengths of 338 and 400 nm, respectively. The relative fluorescence intensity of 8135 ± 615 μm−1 determined for DAP-glucose was used for calibration (see Fig. S1).For AA, labeling was performed in buffered methanol at 80 °C for 1 h. Final concentrations of cellulose, AA, and sodium cyanoborohydride were 2 g liter−1, 50 mm, and 0.5 m, respectively. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 330 and 425 nm respectively. Relative fluorescence intensity of 730 ± 50 μm−1 determined for AA-glucose was used for calibration (14). The rest of the procedure was the same as in the case of DAP labeling.Reduced cellulose (1.0–5.0 g liter−1) was incubated with 0.1 μm cellulase in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 30 °C for 10 s. Hydrolysis was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of BCA reagent. After heating at 75 °C for 30 min, cellulose was separated by centrifugation, and absorbance of supernatant at 560 nm was recorded. Zero data points were treated identically, but cellulases were added after BCA reagent.DAP-cellulose (1.0 g liter−1) was incubated with CBH (5.0–50 nm) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 30 °C. At defined times, the cellulose was separated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for determination of SRGs and DAP-sugars.Reduced cellulose (1.0–5.0 g liter−1) was incubated with cellulase (5.0–50 nm) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 30 °C. At defined times, the cellulose was separated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used for determination of SRGs. After washing of residual cellulose (see determination of IRGs on cellulose), the number of IRGs was determined by labeling with DAP or AA. To make zero data-points, cellulose was separated by centrifugation before the addition of cellulase, and supernatant was used for the zero data points in measurements of SRGs. In the case of zero data points for IRGs, 0.2 m NaOH was first added to the cellulose pellet followed by the addition of cellulase, and the rest of the treatment was identical to other data points.Processivity is an important kinetic property of polymer active enzymes. True or intrinsic processivity (PIntr) is determined by the dissociation probability (Pd) of the enzyme from the polymer. It has also been demonstrated that PIntr corresponds to the average number of catalytic acts performed before the dissociation of the enzyme from the polymer (38). PIntr can realize only on an ideal polymer where Pd is independent of the position of the enzyme on polymer. Real polymers often contain structural heterogeneities or steric obstacles that may influence Pd. Thus, it is appropriate to define apparent processivity (Papp) as an average number of catalytic acts (Ncatal) performed per initiation of a processive run (Ninit) on a real polymer.
 The experimental challenge for the quantification of Papp is the determination of the Ninit. This is the reason for the virtual absence of quantitative data on the processivity of cellulases. For CBHs acting exclusively from the reducing end of a cellulose chain, a substrate with label on the reducing end can be used to reveal the reducing-end exo-mode initiations (Ninit)R-exo (7). If the release of SRGs is followed in parallel with the released end-label (EL) (Fig. 1C), then Papp can be found from Equation 2.
 Because the first catalytic act will release the EL that cannot be detected as an SRG, the term [EL] has to be included to account for Ncatal. If CBH can use an initiation mode other than reducing-end exo in parallel, the Papp will be overestimated, as only reducing-end initiations are detected.Principle of the measurement of cellulase processivity. A, labeling of reducing groups on cellulose via reductive amination with fluorescent DAP is shown. Elimination of water between the aldehyde group of the reducing end of the cellulose chain and the amino group of DAP results in the formation of a Schiff base intermediate (not shown), which is reduced by NaCNBH3 to form a stable aminoalditol derivative of cellulose (DAP-cellulose). The stronger reducing agent NaBH4 can be used to reduce aldehyde groups of cellulose to corresponding alditols, which do not give reductive amination with DAP. B, the active site tunnel of TrCel7A and PcCel7D contains 10 glucose unit binding sites (not numbered) and the cleavage site (indicated with arrowheads) is between binding sites −2 and +2. Association (kon) results in the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex that can dissociate (koff) or go through catalytic events (kcat) to form cellobiose and an enzyme-substrate complex localizing one cellobiose unit further on the cellulose chain. Intrinsic processivity (PIntr) can be found from the values of kcat and koff. In this study the koff values were found on reduced cellulose (Equation 6) using the assumption that koff is limiting for enzyme recruitment and kcat ≫ koff. C, release of DAP-sugar end-label (EL) in hydrolysis of DAP-cellulose reveals the number of initiations from the reducing end of cellulose ((Ninit)R-exo). D, hydrolysis of reduced cellulose and detection of enzyme-generated IRGs on residual cellulose reveals the sum of endo-initiations (Ninit)endo and (Ninit)R-exo. Apparent processivity (Papp) is given by the ratio of enzyme-released SRGs and IRGs (Equation 3). Comparison of the number of initiations measured using DAP-cellulose and reduced cellulose as substrate allows calculation of the probability for endo-initiation (PEndo, Equation 4).Using reduced cellulose as a substrate and detection of CBH generated IRGs on residual cellulose enables measuring of the sum of endo-mode initiations, (Ninit)Endo and (Ninit)R-exo (Fig. 1D). Reduced cellulose contains the sugar alditol in its former reducing end and will not go through the reductive amination with amines (Fig. 1A). Upon action by a reducing-end exo-enzyme, the sugar alditol is released, and IRG is generated. The latter can be visualized by labeling with fluorescent amines like DAP or AA (Fig. 1A). Internal cuts resulting from endo-mode actions will also generate new reducing ends on cellulose and are visualized (Fig. 1D). However, if a cellulose chain is completely degraded, IRG will not be produced, and Papp will be overestimated. Therefore, substrates with high DP must be used to minimize this possibility. Papp on reduced cellulose is given by Equation 3.
 [RGTot] is the total concentration of reducing groups generated during the hydrolysis of reduced cellulose. As the first catalytic act in the processive run does not produce a detectable SRG but produces detectable IRG, the term [IRG] has to be included to account for Ncatal. Comparison of the number of initiations measured using DAP-cellulose and reduced cellulose as a substrate (Fig. 1, C and D) enables us to find the probability of endo-mode initiations (PEndo).
 Concentrations of IRGs and released EL for insertion into Equation 4 must be measured at the same value of [SRG]. However, both approaches (Fig. 1, C and D) fail to reveal the exo-mode initiations from the non-reducing end, and its presence leads to the overestimation of Papp. Unfortunately, the non-reducing end lacks specific chemistry, and initiations from this end cannot be visualized.To reveal the number of initiations, the hydrolysis must be conducted under single-hit conditions, meaning that upon dissociation the possibility for the enzyme to attack the chain end that has been already attacked would be negligible. To avoid the possible limitation of Papp by the length of the cellulose chain, substrates with high DP must be used. High DP celluloses have low numbers of chain ends, meaning that sensitive detection of IRGs is necessary to follow the hydrolysis under single-hit conditions. Among absorbance-based methods, the highest sensitivity and greatest reliability can be achieved with a modified BCA method (14, 36). However, the sensitivity of the BCA method was not sufficient for the purposes outlined in this study. Fluorescence measurements provide about 2 orders of magnitude greater sensitivity than absorbance measurements. Recently we optimized the labeling of cellulose with AA (14). However, about 10 times greater sensitivity can be achieved by the use of DAP. Here we optimized the DAP labeling of IRGs on cellulose. Labeling efficiency was found to be independent of cellulose concentration. Comparative determination of CBH generated IRGs by AA and DAP labeling indicated that DAP labeling was quantitative. See Fig. S1 for determination of fluorescence parameters of DAP-sugar conjugate and optimization of DAP labeling of cellulose. In addition to the detection of CBH generated IRGs on cellulose, DAP labeling was also used for the preparation of reducing-end labeled substrates for CBHs (Fig. 1C).With the aim to quantify the processivity of TrCel7A and PcCel7D, we first assessed the number of initiations in the hydrolysis of reducing-end DAP-labeled bacterial cellulose (DAP-BC). Released DAP-sugar conjugates, hereafter referred to as end-label, were detected by fluorescence. Using this approach we can reveal the number of initiations from the reducing-end ((Ninit)R-exo) (Equation 2, Fig. 1C). However, resulting Papp values increased with increasing enzyme to substrate ratio, indicating the presence of another mode of initiation that has lower affinity and that was used in parallel with (Ninit)R-exo. To see the possible contribution of endo-mode initiations ((Ninit)Endo), comparative experiments were performed on reduced BC (rBC). After treatment of rBC with CBH, the CBH generated IRGs on residual cellulose were measured using DAP labeling. This approach provides us with the sum of (Ninit)R-exo and (Ninit)Endo (Equation 3, Fig. 1D). The general activity of CBHs on rBC was similar to that on DAP-BC (Fig. 2A), but the number of initiations measured on rBC was significantly higher than that measured on DAP-BC (Fig. 2B). The concentration of released EL from the DAP-BC hydrolysis and the concentration of IRGs generated to rBC allowed calculation of the probability of endo-mode initiation (PEndo) (Equation 4). For an example of calculation of PEndo values, see supplemental Table S1. For TrCel7A, about every second initiation on BC was endo-mode initiation (Table 1). Even higher PEndo values were found for PcCel7D. PEndo values were also found for the hydrolysis of AC. The general activity of both CBHs on DAP-labeled AC (DAP-AC) and reduced AC (rAC) was similar (Fig. 2C). The number of initiations measured using rAC as substrate and the DAP labeling of IRGs was clearly higher than the number of initiations revealed using DAP-AC as substrate and the measurement of released EL (Fig. 2D). Resulting PEndo values on AC were higher than those on BC (Table 1). For both CBHs, PEndo values slightly increased with increasing enzyme concentration (Table 1), indicating that the endo-mode initiation has lower affinity than the reducing-end exo initiation. On AC, the PEndo values were determined also for EGs TrCel5A and TrCel12A. Both enzymes displayed PEndo values above 0.97 (supplemental Fig. S2). To rule out the possibility that observed endo-mode initiations were caused by the modifications at the reducing ends of DAP-BC and rBC, the use of endo-mode initiation by CBHs was also confirmed on native unmodified BC (supplemental Fig. S3).Comparative hydrolysis of DAP-cellulose and reduced cellulose reveals the use of endo-mode initiation by cellobiohydrolases TrCel7A and PcCel7D. Experiments were performed in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 30 °C. Cellulose concentration was 1.0 g liter−1, and enzyme was 20 nm TrCel7A (□ and ■) or PcCel7D (△ and ▲). Open symbols (□ and △) refer to DAP-cellulose, and filled symbols (■ and ▲) refer to reduced cellulose. Error bars are from three independent measurements. A, release of SRGs in hydrolysis of DAP-BC and rBC is shown. B, release of EL in hydrolysis of DAP-BC and formation of IRGs in hydrolysis of rBC is shown. C, release of SRGs in hydrolysis of DAP-AC and reduced rAC is shown. D, release of EL in hydrolysis of DAP-AC and formation of IRGs in hydrolysis of rAC is shown.Probabilities of endo-mode initiation for TrCel7A and PcCel7D on bacterial cellulose and amorphous celluloseProbability of endo-mode initiation (PEndo) was found from comparative hydrolysis of DAP-cellulose and reduced cellulose (Fig. 1, C and D, Equation 4). The concentration of cellulose was 1.0 g l−1, and averages are taken from 5–7 different time points (see supplemental Table S1).Reports on possible endo-activity of family 7 CBHs have been contradictory (39). Kinetic studies with tetrasaccharide carrying bulky substituents on both of its ends suggested a possible endo-character of TrCel7A (40). Endo-activity of TrCel7A on cellulose has also been reported before (41) but in earlier studies possible contamination of CBH preparations with EGs was often suspected (39). Numerous control experiments showed that contamination of CBH preparations by EG activity cannot be the reason for the high PEndo values observed here (for the results and more detailed discussion, see supplemental material and supplemental Figs. S3 and S4). Based on its structure, TrCel7A has been considered a highly processive strictly reducing-end exo-acting enzyme (17). The active site tunnel of TrCel7A is surrounded by four loops with the major one known as an “exo-loop” that roofs the tunnel (9, 10, 12). Although for family 6 CBHs the mobility of active site loops that allows occasional opening of the tunnel and endo-mode of initiation is well documented (42, 43), it has not been demonstrated for family 7 CBHs. Results presented here suggest this possibility also for family 7 CBHs. The structure of PcCel7D is very similar to that of TrCel7A but reveals a deletion of six residues in the corresponding exo-loop (12). A more open active site structure of PcCel7D can account for the higher PEndo values observed here. Observed higher PEndo values on AC compared with BC apparently reflect the higher amount of sites available for endo-action on AC (Table 1). Alteration between endo- and exo- modes of action depending on the crystallinity of the substrate have been suggested before for a cellulase as well as κ-carrageenase (44, 45). High PEndo values observed here for TrCel7A and PcCel7D together with earlier reports of mixed exo/endo character of cellulases (23) and chitinases (28) suggest that strict exo-acting enzymes may be rare if present at all among cellulases and chitinases.Apparent processivity (Papp) was measured on rBC and rAC using the DAP labeling of cellulase generated IRGs on the residual cellulose (Fig. 1D). Data were plotted in coordinates of [RGTot] versus [IRG]. If single hit conditions are met, the data plotted in these coordinates should follow the straight line with the slope equal to Papp (Fig. 3, Equation 3). On rBC, the Papp values of 61 ± 14 and 52 ± 5 were found for TrCel7A and PcCel7D, respectively. Papp values measured for TrCel7A and PcCel7D on rAC were also similar to each other but lower than those measured on rBC (Fig. 3 and Table 2). On rAC, Papp values were also measured for EGs TrCel5A and TrCel12A (Fig. 3B). Papp values of 4.7 ± 0.2 and 2.7 ± 0.2 found for TrCel5A and TrCel12A, respectively, were significantly lower than corresponding figures for CBHs (Table 2). The most distributive EG was TrCel12A. Papp found for TrCel5A is similar to the processivity of 4.3 estimated for another family 5 cellulase, EG Cel5H, from the bacterium Saccharophagus degradans (30).Apparent processivity of cellulases on bacterial cellulose and amorphous cellulose. Experiments were performed in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 30 °C. Reduced cellulose was used as a substrate. SRGs were measured using the BCA method, and formation of IRGs was measured using fluorescence labeling. The amount of RGtot was found from the sum of SRGs and IRGs. Solid lines are from the linear regression, and the slope of the line equals the apparent processivity (Papp, Equation 3). A, reduced bacterial cellulose was 1.0 g liter−1, and enzyme was 20 nm TrCel7A (□) or PcCel7D (□). Error bars are from three independent measurements. B, in the case of cellobiohydrolases TrCel7A (□) and PcCel7D (△), the concentration of reduced amorphous cellulose (rAC) was 1.0 g liter−1, and enzyme varied between 5 and 100 nm. In the case of endoglucanases TrCel5A (♢) and TrCel12A (×), the concentration of enzyme was 20 nm, and rAC was 3.0 and 5.0 g liter−1, respectively. Error bars are from three independent measurements.Values of rate constants and processivity of cellulases on amorphous cellulose and bacterial cellulosea In this study the koff values were found on reduced cellulose (Equation 6) using the assumption that koff is limiting for enzyme recruitment and kcat ≫ koff.b Intrinsic processivity (PIntr) was calculated according to Equation 5 using tabulated kcat and koff values.c Apparent processivity (Papp) was measured on reduced cellulose (Fig. 1D, Equation 3).Although reports on the values of processivity of glycoside hydrolases are rare, approximate figures can be found in the literature. Detection of enzyme generated IRGs on unmodified cellulose by the use of absorbance-based methods have revealed processivity values for CBHs and processive EGs between 5 and 25 (24,–27, 29). Although low, these figures are expected to be overestimated for two reasons; (i) if single-hit conditions are not satisfied, repeated attacks on an IRG, once attacked by the enzyme, will not be detected, and (ii) detection of IRGs on unmodified cellulose can reveal only the number of endo-initiations. Assessment of the processivity of chitinases from Serratia marcescens on partly deacetylated soluble chitin derivative under single-hit conditions but using the assumption that all initiations are endo-mode revealed processivity values of 9.1 and 3.4 for ChiA and ChiB, respectively (28). ChiA and ChiB are effective in degradation of crystalline chitin, and the structure of both enzymes is in accordance with the processive mode of action (46, 47). For CBHs, the ratio of released cellobiose to glucose has also been used as a measure of the processivity, but the validity of this approach depends on the preferences for the initial binding mode between CBH and cellulose (31). The latter approach also results in processivity values between 5 and 25 (12, 29, 31). We have reported processivity values for TrCel7A around 90 and 40 cellobiose units on AA-labeled BC and AA-labeled bacterial microcrystalline cellulose, respectively (7). However, these figures may be overestimated because only (Ninit)R-exo was detected. In that study the lower processivity on AA-bacterial microcrystalline cellulose was explained by possible limitations of processivity by the DP of AA-bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (7). The average DPs of rBC and rAC used in this study (determined before the reduction of cellulose using the BCA method) (14) were 2300 and 1800 glucose units, respectively, meaning that measured Papp values cannot be limited by the DP of the substrate. The fact that Papp values for TrCel7A and PcCel7D were similar to each other but differed on different celluloses (Table 2) suggests that the Papp of CBHs is determined by the physicochemical properties of the substrate.Finding that Papp of CBHs was dependent on the nature of the substrate prompted us to estimate the values of intrinsic processivity (PIntr) of cellulases. PIntr depends of the values of two rate constants, the dissociation rate constant of the enzyme-substrate complex (koff), and the catalytic constant (kcat). kcat represents the rate constant leading from one productive complex through catalytic events to another productive complex one product unit further on the polymer chain (Fig. 1B). For processive enzymes, kcat ≫ koff, and PIntr approximates to
 Thus, to estimate PIntr we need estimates for kcat and koff.Measurement of the values of kinetic parameters for cellulases acting on cellulose has been complicated by non-linear kinetics that is caused by the heterogeneous nature of the insoluble substrate (48). Fig. 4 shows the formation of RGTot in time upon hydrolysis of rAC by TrCel7A, PcCel7D, or TrCel5A. Both CBHs displayed characteristic “burst” kinetics (7) with the first rapid formation of RGTot followed by the much slower but linear formation of RGTot in time (Fig. 4). In this linear stage the rate of enzyme recruitment is at a steady state (7). In our previous study we demonstrated that the association of CBH and cellulose (step 1 in Fig. 1B) was fast and proposed that the rate of recruitment of CBH was limited by the slow dissociation of CBH from the cellulose chain (49). Thus, using the assumption that koff is rate-limiting for enzyme recruitment and kcat ≫ koff, the value of koff can be found from the rate of initiations (ΔNinit/Δt) in the linear stage that follows the initial transient burst caused by the first rapid binding.
 The term [ES] in Equation 6 stands for the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex, and [E]tot is total enzyme concentration. Approximation of [ES] ≈ [E]tot is justified because of the low enzyme and high substrate concentrations used in this study (49).Rapid slowdown in hydrolysis rates is characteristic for cellobiohydrolases. Experiments were performed in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 30 °C. Reduced amorphous cellulose (2.0 g liter−1) was used as substrate, and the enzyme was 0.1 μm cellobiohydrolase TrCel7A (□), PcCel7D (△), or endoglucanase TrCel5A (♢). The amount of RGTot was measured using the BCA method. The inset shows the initial burst of RGTot observed with CBHs. Error bars are from three independent measurements.koff values were found from the linear region of the formation of IRGs in time (Fig. 2, B and D, supplemental Fig. S5, A and B) and are listed in Table 2. For both TrCel7A and PcCel7D, the koff values on rBC were about 3 times lower than on rAC, indicating that interactions between the cellulose chain and the active site tunnel of CBHs are not sole determinants of koff. The koff value of 0.029 ± 0.003 s−1 (30 °C) has been reported for dissociation of isolated carbohydrate binding module of TrCel7A from bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (50). This figure is about 30 times higher than the koff found for dissociation of TrCel7A from rBC, suggesting that dissociation of TrCel7A is not limited by the dissociation of its carbohydrate binding module. On rAC the koff values were also measured for the EGs TrCel5A and TrCel12A. koff values for the EGs were about 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for CBHs (Table 2). This finding is consistent with a shorter and more open active site architecture of EGs (17).Recently we proposed a mechanism for initial rapid rate retardation in CBH-catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis (49). According to this, the rate of formation of hydrolysis products after the first transient stage is governed by the value of koff and the average length of the obstacle-free path of CBH on a cellulose chain. Thus, to measure the value of kcat (step 2 in Fig. 1B), one must follow the progression of hydrolysis in the first transient stage before most of the CBH molecules have not yet passed through the average obstacle-free path. Therefore, kcat values were found from the initial rates (based on activity measurements after 10 s of hydrolysis) of the formation of RGTot in hydrolysis of rBC and rAC at different concentrations (supplemental Fig. S5, C and D) and are listed in Table 2. With all cellulases, the kcat values obtained here are in accordance with the corresponding figures found from the initial rates of the hydrolysis of amorphous and crystalline celluloses (51). Although the kcat values for EGs were higher than corresponding figures for CBHs, the difference was much less prominent than in the case of koff values (Table 2).Provided with the estimates for kcat and koff, we can now estimate the values of PIntr using Equation 5. The highest PIntr value (4000 ± 570) was found for TrCel7A on rBC. PIntr values for PcCel7D were lower than those for TrCel7A on both rBC and rAC, and the difference was governed by differences in koff values (Table 2). For both CBHs, PIntr values were more than an order of magnitude higher than measured Papp values, confirming the limitation of the CBH processivity by the substrate. We propose that it is the average length of the obstacle-free path on the cellulose chain that sets limits for processive movement of CBHs. For EGs, the differences between PIntr and Papp values were less obvious (Table 2). Because of their lower intrinsic processivity, EGs are expected to be less prone to hindrance by obstacles.CBHs have evolved for the degradation of lignocellulosic substrates. The average length of the obstacle-free path available for processive runs (49) in lignocelluloses is expected to be much shorter than PIntr values estimated for CBHs (Table 2). This suggests that the value of PIntr itself cannot be the primary target for the selection of CBHs. CBHs TrCel7A and PcCel7D differed in koff values, whereas their kcat values were similar (Table 2). Furthermore, large differences between the PIntr values for EGs and CBHs were also caused by widely different koff values, whereas kcat values for CBHs and EGs were within the same order of magnitude (Table 2). These results suggest that the value of koff may be the primary target for the selection of cellulases. koff values in the range of 10−3 s−1 (Table 2) correspond to the half-lives of CBH cellulose complexes, around 10 min. One may speculate that halted CBHs are in the “standby” position to catch the momentum to move forward if an obstacle dissociates (49), but the biological rationale of these stable non-productive complexes remains to be solved. On the other hand, low koff apparently limits the performance of CBHs on soluble and amorphous polymers where the accessibility of glycosidic bonds is high. On these substrates enzymes with high koff values and, therefore, high rates of enzyme recruitment, like EGs, are at an advantage (Fig. 4). The disadvantage of processivity on soluble and amorphous polymers was first clearly demonstrated for chitinases ChiB (19) and ChiA (52) from S. marcescens but has also been suggested for cellulases (12) and endosialidase (53). However, biomass pretreatment technologies that result in the production of amorphous cellulose are not yet cost effective for large scale industrial applications, meaning that the degradation of crystalline cellulose remains a key issue in commercialization of second generation biofuels. It should be noted that not all cellulolytic systems rely on processive CBHs (30, 54, 55). Therefore, the exact mechanism of different strategies that have evolved for cellulose degradation and the role of the processivity of enzymes remain intriguing questions.Hele Teugjas from the University of Tartu is acknowledged for the preparation of BC.

PMC3013676,ThYme: a database for thioester-active enzymes,False,"The ThYme (Thioester-active enzYme; http://www.enzyme.cbirc.iastate.edu) database has been constructed to bring together amino acid sequences and 3D (tertiary) structures of all the enzymes constituting the fatty acid synthesis and polyketide synthesis cycles. These enzymes are active on thioester-containing substrates, specifically those that are parts of the acyl-CoA synthase, acyl-CoA carboxylase, acyl transferase, ketoacyl synthase, ketoacyl reductase, hydroxyacyl dehydratase, enoyl reductase and thioesterase enzyme groups. These groups have been classified into families, members of which are similar in sequences, tertiary structures and catalytic mechanisms, implying common protein ancestry. ThYme is continually updated as sequences and tertiary structures become available.The ThYme (Thioester-active enzYme, http://www.enzyme.cbirc.iastate.edu) database presents enzymes acting on thioester-containing substrates, especially those involved in fatty acid and polyketide synthesis.There are different ways to classify enzymes and proteins. The Enzyme Commission (EC) scheme classifies enzymes by the reactants or substrates that they primarily attack and by the reactions that they catalyze (1). Another way is by three-dimensional (tertiary) structure, as found in the SCOP database (2). A third method is to classify enzymes by primary (amino acid sequence) structure similarity. We have done so for thioesterases (TEs) (3) and now for the other enzyme groups in the fatty acid synthesis cycle. Previously, this has been done with glycoside hydrolases and other carbohydrate enzymes (4) and with peptidases (5). Also, Pfam (6) has done the same in a more universal way.The fatty acid synthesis cycle (Figure 1) is the main pathway used by organisms to form lipids. The constituent members of this cycle are activated by the presence of thioester groups binding either coenzyme A (CoA) or acyl carrier protein (ACP). First, catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthases (ACSs), an acyl group is joined with CoA to make acyl-CoA, also called the priming substrate. Second, the priming substrate is carboxylated by acyl-CoA carboxylases (ACCs) to make the elongating substrate. The elongating substrate’s carrier molecule may be changed from CoA to ACP by acyl transferases (ATs). Then ketoacyl synthases (KSs) join the priming and elongating substrates, releasing a carbon dioxide and making ketoacyl-ACPs. The ketoacyl-ACP molecule then passes through a series of reduction, dehydration, and reduction steps catalyzed by ketoacyl reductases (KRs), hydroxyacyl dehydratases (HDs) and enoyl reductases (ERs), respectively, to create an acyl-ACP molecule two carbon atoms longer than the priming substrate. This new longer acyl-ACP molecule is then joined by a KS to another elongating substrate. This cycle elongates the acyl chain by two carbon atoms each turn until TEs hydrolyzes the CoA or ACP from the acyl group, effectively terminating fatty acid biosynthesis. Also, methylketone synthases (MKSs) can release molecules from the cycle before the reduction-dehydration-reduction steps. These enzymes first hydrolyze the thioester bond and then decarboxylate the carboxyl group of a 3-oxoacyl-ACP molecule, leaving a terminal methyloxo group (7). They have a TE domain, which appears in ThYme with other TEs; they do not form a large enzyme group.
The fatty acid synthesis cycle and the enzyme groups that are part of it. ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACS: acyl-CoA synthase; AT: acyl transferase; ER: enoyl reductase; HD: hydroxyacyl dehydratase; KR: ketoacyl reductase; KS: ketoacyl synthase; MKS: methylketone synthase; TE: thioesterase. SX: Coenzyme A or acyl carrier protein.More specifically, the enzyme groups involved in the fatty acid synthesis cycle and that appear in ThYme are the following.
ACSs (part of EC 6.2.1, acid-thiol ligases). These enzymes add CoA to acetate or longer acceptors, powered by ATP or occasionally by GTP. This yields the activated compound and usually AMP, but in some cases ADP or GDP. ACSs are described by EC 6.2.1.1–EC 6.2.1.36, with two entries having been deleted.ACCs (part of EC 6.4.1, ligases that form carbon-carbon bonds). In this step, the activated acceptor is elongated by the addition of a keto group derived from CO2, yielding malonyl-CoA or a longer activated molecule. Four multidomain ACCs with EC designations from 6.4.1.2 to 6.4.1.5 are listed.ATs (part of EC 2.3.1, acyl transferases transferring groups other than amino-acyl groups). These enzymes catalyze the transfer of an acyl chain from a CoA to an ACP or vice versa.KSs (part of EC 2.3.1, acyl transferases transferring groups other than amino-acyl groups). Here the activated malonyl or longer moiety is joined to an activated cycle constituent, releasing CO2 and HSX, where SX is CoA or ACP. The growing chain is elongated by generally two, but occasionally more, carbon atoms. This EC category contains 190 entries, of which three has been deleted. Twenty EC entries out of 187 are KSs.KRs (part of EC 1.1.1, oxidoreductases acting on the CH–OH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor, describing the reverse reaction). In those fatty acid synthesis cycle reactions, 3-oxo groups are reduced to 3-hydroxy groups by NADH or NADPH. EC 1.1.1. contains at present 300 entries, 15 having been deleted.HDs (part of EC 4.2.1, carbon–oxygen hydro-lyases). Here the 3-hydroxy group is removed as water, yielding a double bond linking the 2- and 3-carbon atoms. There are 120 listings in this EC group, 16 having been deleted.ERs (part of EC 1.3.1, oxidoreductases acting on the CH–CH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor). The 2,3-ene bond is reduced to a single bond. This EC group has 84 listings, of which four have been deleted.TEs (part of EC 3.1.2, thioester hydrolases). The thioester group is cleaved with water, leaving a fatty acid and HSX. The 27 EC entries have lost three members by deletion.Polyketide biosynthesis is similar to fatty acid biosynthesis, yet it is more flexible and complex. Here the condensation-reduction-dehydration-reduction cycle is not completed at every turn; the KS-catalyzed reaction can occur between an intermediate in the cycle and an elongating substrate. This allows carbonyl, hydroxyl and/or ethylene groups into the acyl chain. The TE will either hydrolyze acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP with a water molecule, or cyclize the chain using an alcohol on the chain itself for hydrolysis. Also, different compounds can be used for priming and elongating substrates.These processes can be carried out by individual independent enzymes, or by large multimodular fatty acid synthases (FASs) or polyketide synthases (PKSs) that contain the number of domains necessary, and in a specific order, to produce the desired molecule.Among other uses, fatty acids have been recently proposed as biofuel feedstocks (8), while short-chain fatty acids could become feedstocks for biorenewable platform chemicals (9). Polyketides are a diverse family of chemicals, with some having medicinal applications such as erythromycin and tetracycline as antibiotics and doxorubicin and mithramycin in chemotherapy. Tailoring these molecules is of great interest; for that effort ThYme can be a useful tool in finding naturally occurring enzymes and in facilitating enzyme design.Family members must have strong sequence similarity and near-identical tertiary structures, and they must share general mechanisms as well as catalytic residues located in the same position. Methods for identifying and populating families were developed with TEs and later applied to other sequence groups. They were detailed in our previous work and its Supporting Information section (3).
Experimentally confirmed enzyme sequences were used as queries. They were gathered from UniProt (10), using only reviewed entries noted as having ‘Evidence at protein level’.A series of successive Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (11) searches and comparison among results reduced query sequences to a few representative ones.The catalytic domains of representative query sequences were subjected to BLAST to populate the families. These domains were selected by referring to Pfam-A (6), or by constructing a hidden Markov model profile (12) from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) based on the initial BLAST result.Experimentally confirmed enzymes were surveyed to search for missing potential enzyme families.The uniqueness of the families was confirmed by MSAs, by tertiary structure superposition and comparison, and by catalytic residue positions.At present, ACSs are divided into five families, ATs into one, KSs into five, KRs into four, HDs into six, ERs into six and TEs into 23. ACCs are multidomain proteins first shown as organized into domains followed by each domain divided into families: one family of the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain, one family of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and two families of the carboxyl transferase (CT) domain appear. These enzyme groups’ annotation and sequences in each family appear in ThYme organized in the way mentioned below.The home page gives links to every enzyme group, as well as general information for viewers and citing and contact information. In each enzyme group’s main page, all families are listed in a table with ‘Names of enzymes and genes present’, which presents a non-exhaustive overview of the sequences found. This is meant to guide new users to the family that contains their enzymes of interest.At the top of each enzyme family’s page (Figure 2), a table gives general information about the family, describing protein folds (if known from crystal structures), the names of enzymes and genes present (the list is not exhaustive), EC numbers (the most common ones), the catalytic residues (if they are known from the literature), and other notes. Also shown is the total number of Protein Data Bank (PDB) (13) structures, and enzymes with ‘Evidence at protein level’ and ‘Evidence at transcript level’ (see Experimentally Characterized sequences section below). This annotation might not be complete for all families.
A typical family homepage in ThYme.Within an enzyme family’s page, all sequences appear by rows ordered into archaea, bacteria and eukaryota, and alphabetically by producing species. All sequences in a row are identical and come from only one species. Identical sequences from different species are separated into different rows; however, identical sequences from different strains of the same species are not separated. If >500 rows exist, they are shown in multiple pages for a single family. The information is organized into the following columns: (i) names or designations given to the proteins; (ii) EC numbers assigned to them, with a link to the ExPASy proteomics server (14); (iii) genus and species names along with strain designations of the organisms that produced them, with a link to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy browser (15); (iv) their GenBank identification, with a link to the NCBI’s protein database (16); their RefSeq identification, with a link also to the NCBI’s protein database (16); their UniProt identification, with a link to the UniProt database (10); and their PDB identification, with a link to the PDB, if their known tertiary structure is available (13). All sequence names and EC numbers are taken from either UniProt or NCBI’s protein database; we do not assign sequence names or EC numbers.Three features make navigating and retrieving information in ThYme easier. A search tool allows keywords, EC numbers and GenBank, RefSeq, UniProt or PDB accession codes to be searched. Furthermore, each family can be downloaded into a comma-separated value (csv) file, which can be viewed in a spreadsheet. Also, on each family’s page, only rows that include a PDB link or a UniProt link marked with ‘Evidence at transcript level’ or ‘Evidence at protein level’ can be viewed.The content of existing families is updated continuously as NCBI’s protein database, UniProt and PDB databases are updated; if a new sequence belongs in an existing family, it will appear there. To delete or merge existing families, as well as to define new families, the authors’ inspection and judgment is necessary; this cannot be automated.Most sequences have no underlying specific experimental work, as they come from large genomic sequencing projects. The UniProt database, under the field ‘Protein existence’ marks their entries with either ‘Evidence at protein level’ or ‘Evidence at transcript level’ if some experimental work has been done on the sequence. In ThYme, we mark UniProt accessions with ‘Evidence at Protein Level’ with a [P], and those with ‘Evidence at Transcript Level’ with a [T]. The UniProt link or its equivalent in GenBank shows the experimental work’s literature. This should help users identify previous work on enzymes of interest.Some enzymes that appear in ThYme are multidomain FASs, PKSs or non-ribosomal peptide synthases. Each domain in these enzymes has its specific function, but all appear in a single sequence under the same GenBank, RefSeq, UniProt or PDB accession. When the accession code of a multidomain enzyme appears in a family, only the domain of the enzyme group in which the family appears belongs in the family. (Example: UniProt {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P12785"",""term_id"":""2506136"",""term_text"":""P12785""}}P12785 is a rat fatty acid synthase. Its AT domain appears in AT2, its KS domain appears in KS3, its HD domain appears in HD4 and its TE domain appears in TE16.) A single multidomain sequence can have different PDB structures for each domain. Only the structure related to each family’s domain is shown. (Example: UniProt {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P49327"",""term_id"":""269849686"",""term_text"":""P49327""}}P49327 has several PDB structures. Among them, TE domain 1XKT appears in a TE family, AT domain 2JFD appears in an AT family and so forth.)ThYme is most similar to CAZy (17) in appearance and structure, in that both are interactive lists of enzyme primary and tertiary structures. However, they are different in content, as ThYme shows enzymes active on substrates with thioester groups and CAZy shows enzymes active on carbohydrates. ThYme encompasses eight enzyme groups; CAZy on the other hand brings together four enzyme groups as well as different families of carbohydrate-binding modules.ThYme is somewhat similar to MEROPS (18), which classifies peptidases and therefore has many more different enzyme groups and total number of listings. MEROPS and ThYme are also different in appearance and in the method by which listings are accessed.The ESTHER database (19) and the Lipase Engineering Database (20) report sequences of the α/β hydrolase superfamily and lipases, respectively. In both databases, some of their families correspond with some TE families in ThYme, although the exact content and format differ.Finally, Pfam (6) has identified many protein families. Most ThYme families have an equivalent in Pfam. Our differences in methodology lead to different family content: Pfam families are more inclusive, covering a wide range of sequences, while ThYme families are smaller, with all sequences within a family having strong sequence similarity. Also, the purpose and format of the two databases are different; we focus on thioester-active enzymes and provide sequences and structures in families, while Pfam covers all proteins and, given a query, it identifies the family or domain.The ThYme database should provide a useful source of information on these enzymes that can help predict active sites, catalytic residues and mechanisms of individual sequences, as well as providing a standardized nomenclature.US National Science Foundation [through its Engineering Research Center Program, Award No. EEC-0813570, leading to the Center for Biorenewable Chemicals (CBiRC)], headquartered at Iowa State University and including Rice University, the University of California, Irvine, the University of New Mexico, the University of Virginia, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

PMC3026450,Bacterial supersystem for alginate import/metabolism and its environmental and bioenergy applications,False,"Distinct from most alginate-assimilating bacteria that secrete polysaccharide lyases extracellularly, a gram-negative bacterium, Sphingomonas sp. A1 (strain A1), can directly incorporate alginate into its cytoplasm, without degradation, through a “superchannel” consisting of a mouth-like pit on the cell surface, periplasmic binding proteins, and a cytoplasmic membrane-bound ATP-binding cassette transporter. Flagellin homologues function as cell surface alginate receptors essential for expressing the superchannel. Cytoplasmic alginate lyases with different substrate specificities and action modes degrade the polysaccharide to its constituent monosaccharides. The resultant monosaccharides, α-keto acids, are converted to a reduced form by NADPH-dependent reductase, and are finally metabolized in the TCA cycle. Transplantation of the strain A1 superchannel to xenobiotic-degrading sphingomonads enhances bioremediation through the propagation of bacteria with an elevated transport activity. Furthermore, strain A1 cells transformed with Zymomonas mobilis genes for pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II produce considerable amounts of biofuel ethanol from alginate when grown statically.Bacteria belonging to the genus Sphingomonas are gram- negative, yellow-pigmented, aerobic rods.1 Unlike other gram-negative bacteria, sphingomonads contain glycosphingolipids (GSL) with long-chain base dihydrosphingosine in the outer membrane, but have no lipopolysaccharides (LPS).2 GSL confer the property of high hydrophobicity on the cell surface of sphingomonads. In view of these unusual cell surface characteristics, the genus Sphingomonas was reclassified from pseudomonades in 1990 as a new member of the α-4 subgroup of the Proteobacteria.3 More recently, the genus Sphingomonas has been further regrouped into five related genera, namely, Sphingomonas sensu strictu, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, Sphingopyxis and Sphingosinicella.4,5 Some sphingomonads are peculiar due to (1) the presence of many large pleat-like structures on the cell surface (Fig. 1A and D–F);6,7 (2) the extraordinary metabolic ability to degrade various refractory environmental pollutants, notably xenobiotics such as dioxin, biphenyl and bisphenol;8–11 and (3) the production of useful biopolymers such as gellan and related polysaccharides.12,13 Sphingomonas sp. A1 (strain A1) was isolated from soil as an alginate-assimilating bacterium expressing intracellular alginate lyases.6 Strain A1 also contains GSL in the outer membrane and pleat structures on the cell surface (Fig. 1A).Electron micrographs of sphingomonads.

(E) Sphingomonas paucimobilis cell. (F) Sphingomonas parapaucimobilis cell.Alginate is a linear polysaccharide produced by brown seaweeds and certain bacteria. The polymer consists of two monosaccharides, β-d-mannuronate (M) and its C5 epimer α-l-guluronate (G). These two monosaccharides are arranged in three different configurations (Fig. 2): polyM, polyG, and heteropolymeric random sequences (polyMG).14 Brown seaweeds, particularly gulfweed (genus Sargassum), produce alginate as a major component of their cell walls. Gulfweed is cultivable and alginate is easily purified from this seaweed. Consequently, alginate is expected to become a resource for biofuel production due to its abundance in marine biomass.15 Since brown seaweed alginate chelates metal ions and thereby forms a highly viscous solution, this polysaccharide is widely used in the food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries as a reagent for stabilization, thickening and emulsification.16 In the case of the bacterial alginate, an opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, produces alginate-containing extracellular biofilms that are involved in the expression of virulence factors during lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients.17 Since these biofilms often protect P. aeruginosa cells from antibiotics and phagocytic cells, bacterial biofilm-dependent infections are particularly difficult to treat.18Structure of alginate molecules and scheme of the alginate lyase reaction. (A) Disaccharide in polyG. (B) Disaccharide in polyM. (C) Disaccharide in polyMG. Left, disaccharide in each polymer; right, products of the alginate lyase reactions. Thick and thin arrows indicate the sites cleaved by alginate lyases and progression of the enzyme reactions, respectively.Alginate lyases are therefore promising as degrading enzymes for the processing of edible seaweed alginate and the removal of bacterial biofilm alginate. These enzymes are produced by alginate- assimilating microbes isolated from the soil, sea or waste water, and also from some marine algae and mollusks.19 Polysaccharide lyases, including alginate lyases, commonly recognize uronic acid residues in polysaccharides, catalyze the β-elimination reaction, and produce unsaturated saccharides with C=C double bonds at C4 and C5 sites in nonreducing terminal uronic acid residues. Since alginate is a heteropolysaccharide consisting of M and G, alginate lyases are often categorized from the viewpoint of their reaction mode, either endo or exo, and substrate specificity, i.e., a preference for polyM, polyG and/or polyMG (Fig. 2).Most alginate-assimilating bacteria secrete degrading enzymes, i.e., alginate lyases, into the extracellular fraction or periplasm, and incorporate the resultant alginate oligosaccharides across the cytoplasmic membrane. In contrast, strain A1 has an unexplored specific and elegant system, the “superchannel,” on the cell surface for alginate import without degradation (Fig. 3).20 Subsequent to alginate import by the superchannel, four cytoplasmic alginate lyases with different substrate specificities and action modes degrade alginate to its constituent monosaccharides. These lyases therefore constitute a degradation system in the cytoplasm for alginate heteropolysaccharide metabolism.Strain A1 superchannel for alginate import and degradation. G, L-guluronate; M, D-mannuronate; aly, gene for alginate lyases (A1-I, A1-II and A1-III); ccpA, catabolite-control protein gene; algS, algM1 and algM2, ABC transporter genes for alginate import; algQ1 and algQ2, genes for alginate-binding proteins; a1-IV, alginate lyase A1-IV gene; a1-II', alginate lyase A1-II' gene; a1-IV', alginate lyase A1-IV' gene; p3, TonB-dependent transporter; p5, alginate receptor; FlgJ, C-terminal catalytic module for peptidoglycan hydrolysis. Details of each protein function are described in the text.This article deals with the structural and functional aspects of the strain A1 supersystem for alginate import and metabolism. Application of the bacterial supersystem in bioremediation and biofuel production is also discussed.As is often observed in sphingomonads, strain A1 has pleat structures on the cell surface (Fig. 1A).6 However, distinct from other sphingomonads, strain A1 cells when grown on alginate form a mouth-like pit on the cell surface through the reorganization and/or fluidity of the pleat structures. The size of the pit can reach approximately 0.1 µm in diameter (Fig. 1B).7 Conversely, no pit is formed by strain A1 cells grown in alginate-free medium. Thus, pit formation is dependent on the presence of alginate in the external milieu. The size and regulation of pit formation are similar to those of certain eukaryotic organelle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a pit-forming bacterium in the history of microbiology. Thin sections of strain A1 cells grown on alginate show specific sites where the cell membrane sinks into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A). Electron microscopy of strain A1 cells treated with alginate-staining dye has revealed that alginate is concentrated in these pits, suggesting that the pit functions as a funnel or concentrator of alginate (Fig. 4B). Strain A1 cells produce alginate lyases exclusively in the cytoplasm, indicating that a direct import system for macromolecule alginate must be installed in the cell envelope, spanning the outer and inner membranes and the periplasm. In addition to alginate, strain A1 cells can assimilate pectin through the action of cytoplasmic pectin-degrading enzymes. Pectin is a polyuronate consisting of galacturonic acid, which is similar to alginate. This suggests that strain A1 cells have become somewhat specialized to incorporate polysaccharides such as alginate and pectin during their growth and have developed a direct import system to transport these molecules.Pit function. (A) Alginate detection on the cell surface by mucopolysaccharide staining (left, strain A1 cell grown in the absence of alginate; right, strain A1 cell grown on alginate). (B) Thin section of strain A1 cell grown on alginate (arrow indicates the position corresponding to the pit).Strain A1 cells contain a chromosome as a circular double-stranded DNA consisting of 4,622,788 base pairs.21 The genome encodes approximately 4,800 genes and the GC content is relatively high (62%) among gram-negative bacteria. Thirty percent of the total genes of strain A1 show a significant identity with genes encoded in the genome of P. aeruginosa,22 suggesting that strain A1 has evolved from pseudomonads. More than half of the total genes (58%) are categorized in the class of function-unknown genes. Molecular characterization of function-unknown genes will provide useful information on the molecules constituting the supersystem responsible for alginate import and metabolism. A large number of genes for polyuronate (alginate and pectin)-degrading enzymes are encoded in the genome of strain A1, and certain ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes are found in the vicinity of these enzyme genes. This indicates that strain A1 cells have a gene cluster for polyuronate import and degradation.Independent of the chromosome, strain A1 cells also harbor the pA1 plasmid.23 The pA1 plasmid consists of 46,557 base pairs coding for 49 genes with a GC content of 65%. Homology analysis indicates that pA1 is significantly similar to the self-transmissible promiscuous incompatibility (Inc) group P-1β plasmid. However, pA1 is peculiar among IncP-1 plasmids in that it contains no inserted mobile genetic elements.Gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays (unpublished data) has demonstrated that genes encoding the supersystem for alginate import and metabolism, i.e., cell surface alginate-binding proteins, outer membrane-bound transporters, periplasmic alginate-binding proteins, inner membrane-bound ABC transporter, and cytoplasmic alginate lyases and α-keto acid-metabolizing enzymes, are significantly upregulated (3- to 70-fold) in strain A1 cells grown on alginate in comparison with those grown on alginate-free medium. This is convincing evidence that the supersystem in strain A1 cells is specialized for alginate import and metabolism.Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-dependent proteome analysis has indicated that eight proteins (p1–p8) are inducibly expressed in the outer membrane of strain A1 cells grown on alginate.24,25 Each of these proteins is described in detail below.Two flagellin homologues, p5 (40 kDa) and p6 (31 kDa), are inducibly expressed on the cell surface of strain A1.25 This is surprising given that strain A1 exhibits neither cell motility nor flagella formation. Bacterial flagellin is well characterized as a component of the helical filament of the bacterial flagellum. A p6 gene disruptant constructed by insertion of a kanamycin-resistance cassette in the p6 gene shows significant growth retardation in a medium containing alginate as the sole carbon source. The p5 and p6 flagellin homologues might be essential for cell viability because the simultaneous disruption of both genes results in growth failure. There are significant differences in cell surface structures, i.e., pit formation and pleat shape, between the p6 gene disruptant and the wild-type of strain A1. In the p6 gene disruptant, pit formation is incomplete and the cell surface changes from a pleated structure to a network structure (Fig. 1C). This clearly indicates that the flagellin homologues regulate cell surface structures in strain A1. In order to gain a better understanding of the structure and function of strain A1 flagellin homologues, we purified and characterized these proteins following their overexpression in E. coli cells.25The flagellin homologue p5 was found to be inducibly expressed in alginate-grown strain A1 cells and exclusively localized in the cell envelope by immunoelectron microscopy using anti-p5 antibody (Fig. 5A upper). In strain A1 cells grown in alginate-free medium there is hardly any expression of flagellin homologues on the cell surface (Fig. 5A lower). To clarify the intrinsic function of flagellin homologues as cell surface proteins, the interaction between p5 and alginate was analyzed using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor (Fig. 5B). Flagellin homologues exhibit a potent alginate-binding ability, and their affinity is specific for alginate. Two binding sites for alginate were found to be located in flagellin homologues based on the interaction profile. In the case of p5 binding to alginate, the dissociation constants (Kd) at the two sites were determined to be 1.3 × 10−7 M and 2.6 × 10−9 M. This high alginate-binding ability of p5 strongly suggests that strain A1 flagellin homologues function as cell surface receptors for alginate similar to the mammalian CD44 transmembrane receptor for hyaluronan.26Flagellin homologue as a cell surface alginate receptor. (A) Localization of flagellin homologue p5 in strain A1 cells by immunogold electron microscopy (upper, strain A1 cell grown on alginate; lower, strain A1 cell grown in the absence of alginate). (B) Interaction of p5 and alginate using an SPR biosensor. p5 purified from E. coli cells was immobilized on a sensor chip. The binding of p5 to alginate is dependent on alginate concentration (0.31–100 µg/ml).The crystal structure of a truncated p5 (p5ΔN53C45) was determined at 2.0 Å resolution to clarify its peculiar characteristics (alginate binding and cell surface localization) (Fig. 3).27 p5ΔN53C45 denotes a p5 mutant lacking the N-terminal 53 residues and the C-terminal 45 residues. Bacterial flagellin molecules are divided to three regions based on the sequence alignment. Two regions (flagellin_N and flagellin_C motifs) at the N- and C-termini, respectively, are well conserved in bacterial flagellins, whereas there is some variation in the central domain (flagellin_IN motif). Thus, bacterial flagellins are often grouped into two categories, i.e., flagellin_IN motif-free and flagellin_IN motif-including flagellins. p5ΔN53C45 was the first flagellin_IN motif-including flagellin to be structurally determined, although the crystal structure of the flagellin_IN motif-free flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium had previously been determined.28 p5ΔN53C45 consists of two structural elements, an α-domain rich in α-helices and a β-domain rich in β-strands. The α-domain includes the N- and C-terminal regions, whereas the β-domain consists of the central region. The α-domain resembles the D1 domain of the S. typhimurium flagellin, whereas the β-domain is similar to the finger domain of the bacteriophage T4 baseplate protein.29 Through deletion mutant analysis, the N-terminal residues 20–40 and C-terminal residues 353–363 were found to be responsible for alginate binding, suggesting that the edge of the α-domain constitutes the alginate-binding site (Fig. 3).Although strain A1 cells form no flagellum, flagellum-related genes, such as flg and fli clusters, responsible for the formation of flagellar basal body and hook,30 occur in the genome of strain A1. This suggests that strain A1 flagellin homologues are transported to the cell surface by the flagellar basal body-dependent type III secretion system. Indeed, a flgJ-disruptant appears to inhibit the expression of flagellin homologues on the cell surface. FlgJ is involved in the rod assembly of the flagellar basal body and hydrolysis of peptidoglycan.31 In order to obtain clues regarding the peculiar localization of flagellin homologues, the three-dimensional structure of FlgJ-C, the peptidoglycan hydrolase domain, was determined at a 1.74 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 3).32 The enzyme was found to consist of two lobes, α and β. A deep cleft located between the two lobes can accommodate polymer molecules, suggesting that the active site is located in the cleft. The involvement of FlgJ in the secretion of flagellin homologues is now being structurally characterized.The p7 cell surface protein (28 kDa) is inducibly expressed in strain A1 cells grown on alginate.25 To clarify the function of p7, the protein was expressed in E. coli cells, purified, and characterized.33 SPR biosensor analysis revealed that p7 binds to alginate most efficiently at neutral pH with a Kd of 3.6 × 10−8 M. p7 shares a significant sequence identity with bacterial lipoproteins. A four-amino acid sequence termed the “lipobox” [LVI][ASTVI][GAS]C is well conserved at the N-terminus of bacterial lipoproteins.34 However, no lipobox is observed in p7. Thus, p7 was purified from strain A1 cells through anti-p7 antibody-bound column chromatography, and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis and mass spectrometry. As a result, p7 was found to contain no lipid moiety. Similar to the case of p7, a large number of function-unknown proteins are classified as lipoproteins based on sequence similarity. Accordingly, lipoproteins should be assigned carefully on the basis of not only primary structure comparison but also lipoprotein-specific program analysis such as LipoP35 and DOLOP.34p8 (20 kDa) is a predominant protein in the outer membrane of strain A1 cells grown on alginate.24 The protein shares a significant sequence identity with the polyhydroxyalkanoate granule-associated protein of Ralstonia eutropha.36 The p8 gene disruptant exhibits growth retardation in minimal medium containing alginate as the sole carbon source. p8 binds to alginate most efficiently at pH 4.0 with a Kd of 1.3 × 10−7 M. In addition to soluble alginate, p8 shows an affinity for insoluble granules consisting of alginate and metal ions. The alginate-binding ability of p7 and p8 is not much higher than that of cell surface alginate receptors, i.e., flagellin homologues. This suggests that both p7 and p8 can associate with and release the polymer.The above results indicate that p7 and p8 function as cell surface alginate-binding proteins and that their combined action functions to concentrate alginate in the pits on the strain A1 cell surface.Strain A1 cells grown on alginate inducibly produce four proteins, p1 (78 kDa), p2 (71 kDa), p3 (74 kDa) and p4 (72 kDa), in the outer membrane.25 Homology analysis has revealed that all four proteins are similar to the TonB-dependent outer membrane transporter. Gene disruptants of p1, p2, p3 and p4 exhibit significant growth retardation in alginate-containing medium, suggesting that the outer membrane transporter homologues are involved in alginate assimilation. The TonB-dependent outer membrane transporters characterized thus far incorporate iron-bound siderophores, such as ferrichrome, enterobactin, enterochelin and citrate into the periplasm.37–40 The energy for import by the transporters is provided by a proton motive force generated from an inner membrane complex (TonB-ExbB-ExbD).41 Since alginate is well characterized as a potential iron chelator,42 p1, p2, p3 and/or p4 may function as an outer membrane-bound transporter for import of an iron/alginate complex into the periplasm. In this case, alginate is utilized as a siderophore-like substance. Using homology modeling, p3 has been shown to constitute a tunnel-like β-barrel structure spanning the outer membrane (Fig. 3). After being concentrated by p8 in the pit on the cell surface, the iron/alginate complex is probably transported across the outer membrane to the periplasm by the TonB-dependent transporters, p1, p2, p3 and/or p4.Two proteins, AlgQ1 (59 kDa) and AlgQ2 (59 kDa), are inducibly expressed in the periplasm of strain A1 cells grown on alginate.43 AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 bind to alginate with a Kd of 2.3 × 10−7 M and 1.5 × 10−7 M, respectively, and their binding ability is specific for alginate.43 On the basis of the affinity levels, both proteins, similar to p7 and p8, are assumed to be capable of binding and releasing alginate. This indicates that these periplasmic alginate-binding proteins function as mediators of alginate from the outer membrane (TonB-dependent transporter) to the inner membrane (ABC transporter) (Fig. 3). Genes coding for AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 constitute an alginate import/degradation system clustering in the genome of strain A1 (Fig. 3, bottom).Both AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 were found to consist of N- and C-domains with an α/β structure by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 3, bottom).43,44 Three linker loops connect the two domains, and alginate is bound to the cleft located between the domains. A drastic conformational change occurs in AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 through alginate binding and release.43,45 The ligand-free proteins exhibit an opened form, whereas the alginate-bound proteins are converted to a closed form by rotation (30°) and translation (0.5 Å) of both domains. This conversion is achieved by the movement of Glu396 followed by exclusion of a water molecule from the binding site.A hexasaccharide and a longer substrate are predicted to be bound to the active clefts of AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 by structural simulation. Indeed, the clefts in AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 are larger than those in other substrate-binding proteins, such as maltose- binding proteins,43,46 indicating that they enable AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 to accommodate macromolecules. A large number of both positively-charged and aromatic residues are arranged in the clefts of AlgQ1 and AlgQ2 (Fig. 6A).43,45 Positively-charged residues are considered to be crucial for binding to acidic alginate through an electric charge interaction. Stacking interaction is also observed between aromatic and pyranose rings in the proteins and alginate, respectively (Fig. 6B). The nonreducing terminal saccharide of alginate is tightly bound to AlgQ1 and AlgQ2, indicating that the alginate-binding proteins specifically recognize and bind to the substrate nonreducing terminal saccharide, and thereafter deliver the polymer to the inner membrane-bound ABC transporter.Structure of the cleft in the alginate-binding protein AlgQ2. (A) Molecular surface in the binding cleft (yellow, aromatic residues; cyan, positively-charged residues). (B) Alginate-binding site. Red sticks indicate unsaturated alginate tetrasaccharide.A typical ABC transporter in gram-negative bacteria consists of four subunits, i.e., two transmembrane subunits and two ATP-binding proteins, and this accompanied by a periplasmic substrate-binding protein.47 Genes coding for ATP-binding proteins, trans membrane domains, and the associated periplasmic binding protein are organized in an operon structure in the bacterial genome. In the case of alginate import by strain A1 cells, five genes for the ATP-binding proteins (AlgS/AlgS), transmembrane domains (AlgM1 and AlgM2), and two alginate-binding proteins (AlgQ1 and AlgQ2) are assembled in the genome to constitute the operon (Fig. 3 and bottom). Evidence for this organization comes from DNA microarray analysis, which shows that the expression level of each gene in alginate-grown strain A1 cells is mutually comparable.The strain A1 ABC transporter for alginate is composed of a homodimer of AlgS (40 kDa) as an ATPase and a heterodimer of AlgM1 (37 kDa) and AlgM2 (33 kDa) as a permease (Fig. 3).20 AlgS includes P-loop/Walker and ABC-signature motifs responsible for ATPase activity. AlgS has been shown to contain an α/β structure by X-ray crystallographic analysis.48 The three-dimensional structure of the alginate ABC transporter has been constructed through homology modeling and docking simulation (Fig. 3). Both AlgM1 and AlgM2 include six transmembrane α-helices. A pore formed at the interface between AlgM1 and AlgM2 is considered to function as a passage for alginate.The recombinant AlgS expressed in E. coli cells adopts a homodimer form and exhibits an ATPase activity; its activity is unchanged in the presence or absence of alginate-bound AlgQ1 and AlgQ2. The ATPase activity in the inner membrane isolated from alginate-grown strain A1 cells is substantially increased in the presence of AlgQ1 or AlgQ2 in complex with alginate,43 suggesting that the structural change induced in the periplasmic binding proteins through alginate binding contributes to the activation of AlgS via mediation by transmembrane domains AlgM1 and AlgM2. As demonstrated for the E. coli maltose import system,49 alginate-bound AlgQ1 or AlgQ2 functions as a trigger for the transport cycle. Once AlgS binds to ATP, the N- and C-domains in the alginate-bound AlgQ1/AlgQ2 open widely followed by release of alginate, and the periplasmic entrance is inducibly activated by the transmembrane domains (AlgM1 and AlgM2). Subsequently, alginate is incorporated into the cytoplasm using the energy generated through ATP hydrolysis by AlgS.The superchannel, the elegant system evolved in strain A1 cells for alginate import, consists of essentially three sections, i.e., a pit on the cell surface, periplasmic alginate-binding proteins, and the inner membrane-bound ABC transporter (Fig. 3). The cell surface proteins involved in pit formation and function are as follows. Flagellin homologues function as cell surface alginate receptors essential for expressing the superchannel-associated pit. External alginate molecules are concentrated in the pit by cell surface alginate-binding proteins and are subsequently transported to the periplasm by TonB-dependent transporters localized in the outer membrane.Since strain A1 cells can grow on alginate as a sole carbon source, the heteropolysaccharide incorporated in the cytoplasm must be degraded to its constituent monosaccharides by endo- and exotype alginate lyases with different substrate specificities. Three endotype alginate lyases, A1-I (65 kDa), A1-II (25 kDa) and A1-III (40 kDa), are produced in the cytoplasm of strain A1 (Fig. 3).50 A single gene (aly) located in the strain A1 gene cluster for alginate import and degradation encodes these three lyases (Fig. 3, bottom).51 The maturation route for alginate lyases A1-I, A1-II and A1-III is as follows. Po (71 kDa) is first synthesized as a precursor of the gene product, although this precursor exhibits no alginate lyase activity. After cleaving an N-terminal peptide (6 kDa), Po is converted to alginate lyase A1-I. A1-I, which includes N-terminal A1-III and C-terminal A1-II in its molecule, is autocatalytically processed to generate A1-II and A1-III specific for polyG and polyM, respectively. A1-I, a combined form of A1-II and A1-III, exhibits an affinity for both of polyG and polyM. A1-I, A1-II and A1-III all release unsaturated oligosaccharides from alginate, indicating that these lyases exhibit endotype activity.Polysaccharide lyases are categorized into 21 families (PL-1-21) in the carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) database based on their primary structure.52 Alginate lyases are isolated from various organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and marine mollusks,19 and are categorized into the following six families: PL-5, -7, -14, -15, -17 and -18. Among these, most of the bacterial alginate lyases characterized thus far are grouped into two families, PL-5 and -7. Family PL-5 and -7 alginate lyases are known to be specific for polyM and polyG, respectively. In the case of strain A1 endotype alginate lyases, A1-III and A1-II are classified into families PL-5 and -7, respectively, and thus A1-I constitutes a new family, PL-5 + 7. Genes coding for both family PL-5 and -7 alginate lyases are included in the genome of some bacteria such as P. aeruginosa,22 Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato,53 and Azobacter vinelandii;54 however, these genes are located separately in the respective bacterial genomes. The presence of the peculiar A1-I gene, i.e., a fused gene for family PL 5 + 7 enzymes, suggests that A1-I is an ancestor of alginate lyases, and that subsequently the A1-I gene has divided to family PL-5 and -7 genes through duplication, modification, and translocation. The genome sequence of strain A1 provides clues to the molecular diversity and evolution of alginate lyases as follows.55 Other than the genes coding for A1-I, A1-II and A1-III, a novel alginate lyase (A-II', 31 kDa) gene is included in the genome of strain A1, although its location in the strain A1 genome is far from the gene cluster for alginate import and degradation. A1-II' shares a significant sequence identity with A1-II, indicating that A1-II' is a member of family PL-7 based on its primary structure. Since no A1-II' is expressed even in alginate-grown strain A1 cells, the recombinant A1-II' expressed in E. coli cells was characterized. Despite the sequence identity, there is a significant difference in substrate specificity between A1-II and A1-II'. A1-II' exhibits a broad substrate specificity (polyM, polyG and polyMG), whereas A1-II is specific for polyG. A1-I is located in an intermediate position between families PL-5 and -7 in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that the A1-II' gene was derived from the A1-II gene through separation from the A1-I gene, and subsequent duplication, modification, and translocation.Alginate lyases are considered to be promising biochemicals for the processing of edible seaweed alginate and the removal of bacterial biofilm alginate. However, prior to their application in food and medical areas, the structure and function of these enzymes must be extensively studied in order to ensure safe utilization. Family PL-5 alginate lyase A1-III was found by X-ray crystallography to consist of 12 α-helices constituting an α6/α5-barrel structure as a basic scaffold (Fig. 3).56 A tunnel-like cleft is included in the enzyme molecule and a lid loop consisting of residues 57–90 is located over the cleft. A drastic conformational change occurs in A1-III through substrate binding. That is, there is a significant difference in the lid loop structure between substrate-free and bound A1-III. The loop is situated approximately 16.8 Å over the glycosidic linkage to be cleaved in the ligand-free form, whereas this distance is changed to 8.6 Å through substrate binding.57,58 Accordingly, the ligand-free form has an open conformation, whereas the substrate-bound form has a closed conformation. The lid loop movement induces the activation of the catalytic center Tyr246 through the formation of a Tyr68–Tyr246 pair, binding of substrates, and release of products. Reactions catalyzed by polysaccharide lyases are divided to three steps:59 first, neutralization or removal of the negative charge on the C6 carboxylate anion by residue A; second, the abstraction of the C5 proton at subsite +1 by a general base (residue B); and third, proton donation to the O4 atom at subsite +1 by a general acid (residue C). In the case of A1-III reactions, His192 was found to function as residue A, and Tyr246 as both residues B and C by structural determination of the alginate tetrasaccharide-bound A1-III (Fig. 7A). The catalysis by a single Tyr as an active residue is considered to be a novel β-elimination reaction.58,60Structure and function of alginate lyases. (A) Active site in A1-III complexed with unsaturated alginate tetrasaccharide. (B) Removal of alginate biofilm by A1-III (left, P. aeruginosa cells covered with biofilm; right, P. aeruginosa cells exposed after treatment with A1-III). (C) Active site in A1-II' complexed with unsaturated alginate tetrasaccharide.The pathogenic bacterium P. aeruginosa produces a capsule- like biofilm that contains alginate.61 A firm barrier of the biofilm covers the bacterial cells (Fig. 7B, left), protecting them from attack by antimicrobial agents and phagocytes. Consequently, biofilm-dependent bacterial infections are considered difficult to treat. Removal of the bacterial biofilm by degrading enzymes thus constitutes a novel therapy for biofilm-dependent bacterial infectious diseases. Since A1-III shows a potent activity against the bacterial alginate (Fig. 7B, right), this enzyme is considered to be a promising candidate for the treatment of such diseases.62The three-dimensional structure of family PL-7 alginate lyase A1-II' was determined at 1.0 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography.63 The enzyme has a β-sandwich structure consisting of two β-sheets (Fig. 3). An active site is situated in the glove-like cleft covered with two flexible loops (residues 133–145 and 193–203).63 The movement of these loops is crucial for substrate accommodation at the active site.64 Structural determinants in A1-II' for a broad substrate specificity were identified through structural comparison between M- and G-trisaccharide-bound A1-II' molecules. The substrate's carboxyl groups are recognized by specific residues, whereas the substrate's hydroxyl groups are appropriately bound to residues in a nonspecific manner. The crystal structure of A1-II' in complex with alginate tetrasaccharide indicated that the catalytic reaction mechanism of the enzyme occurs as follows (Fig. 7C): Gln189 as residue A neutralizes the negative charge of the carboxyl group; His191 as residue B abstracts the C5 proton; and Tyr284 as residue C donates the proton to the glycosidic bond to be cleaved.Alginate incorporated in the cytoplasm is depolymerized by A1-I, A1-II and A1-III to unsaturated di, tri and tetrasaccahhrides with different M/G ratios as final products.50 The resultant alginate oligosaccharides are degraded to the constituent monosaccharides by alginate lyase A1-IV (86 kDa).65 In contrast to endotype A1-I, A1-II and A1-III, A1-IV exhibits an exotype activity, i.e., it releases only monosaccharide from alginate oligosaccharides. In addition to alginate oligosaccharides, alginate in a polymeric form is also degraded to its constituent monosaccharides by A1-IV. A1-IV is peculiar in that the enzyme acts on alginate poly- and oligosaccharides in the saturated form, as well as on unsaturated oligosaccharides, indicating that A1-IV can degrade both saturated and unsaturated alginate poly- and oligosaccharides with various M/G ratios.66 Due to instability, the pyranose ring of the resultant monosaccharides opens nonenzymatically to generate an α-keto acid (4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid). The gene coding for A1-IV is located downstream from the AlgQ2 gene for periplasmic alginate-binding protein, indicating that the A1-IV gene is included in the gene cluster for alginate import and degradation (Fig. 3, and bottom).20,51,65The increasing number of bacterial genome sequence analyses indicates that putative genes similar to the A1-IV gene occur in the genomes of some bacteria. The strain A1 genome also encodes a A1-IV homologue, A1-IV′ (90 kDa). Although A1-IV' catalyzes the cleavage of glycosidic bonds in alginate molecules through the β-elimination reaction, unsaturated di- and trisaccharides are released as the main products in the enzyme reaction. This implies that A1-IV′ is an endotype alginate lyase.67 On the other hand, another A1-IV homologue, Atu3025 (88 kDa), from Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been identified as an exotype alginate lyase.68 Accumulated sequence information indicates that A1-IV and other A1-IV homologues constitute a novel polysaccharide lyase family, PL-15, and points to the evolutionary route of alginate lyases in the PL-15 family.67 Similar to A1-II′, no A1-IV′ is expressed in strain A1 cells grown on alginate, suggesting that the A1-IV′ gene is derived from the A1-IV gene and that A1-IV is the original member of the PL-15 family.As described above, in addition to two silent genes for A1-II′ and A1-IV′, four genes encoding three endotype alginate lyases and one exotype alginate lyase are included in the genome of strain A1. These alginate lyases are categorized into families PL-5, -7, -5 + 7 and -15, which contain almost all the bacterial alginate lyases. On the basis of this gene profile, it can be postulated that strain A1 is the original producer of alginate lyases.Monosaccharides generated from alginate through the reactions of endo- and exotype alginate lyases are nonenzymatically converted to an α-keto acid (4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid). Although the metabolic pathway for α-keto acid derived from alginate has been postulated in P. aeruginosa,69 the genes coding for the enzymes involved in the pathway remain to be clarified. In strain A1 cells grown on alginate, NADPH-dependent reductase (A1-R, 26 kDa) was found to act on α-keto acid derived from the polysaccharide.70 The enzyme is specific for α-keto acid derived from alginate and converts 4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid to 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconic acid (KDG) (Fig. 8). Since a large number of bacteria and yeasts show no growth in nutrient-rich media containing α-keto acid, this compound is considered to be highly toxic to both of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. For example, no growth of E. coli cells is observed in LB medium in the presence of α-keto acid, whereas the cells show a significant growth in medium containing KDG produced from α-keto acid by the action of A1-R. This clearly indicates that A1-R is crucial in strain A1 cells for metabolizing alginate and detoxifying α-keto acid.The proposed pathway for α-keto acid metabolism in strain A1 cells.Molecular cloning of the A1-R gene has indicated that the enzyme is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family.71 Although the enzyme gene is located far from the gene cluster for alginate import and degradation, DNA micro array analysis demonstrates that, similar to alginate-related genes in the cluster, the enzyme gene is inducibly expressed in the presence of alginate. The crystal structure of the recombinant A1-R expressed in E. coli cells has been determined at 1.6 Å resolution by X-ray crystallography.72 The enzyme has a three-layer (α/β/α) structure as a basic scaffold, as is typically observed in the SDR family enzymes. A Rossmann fold for coenzyme binding was also identified in A1-R. Indeed, NADP was found to be bound to the Rossmann fold through structural determination of A1-R in complex with NADP.72On the basis of a comparison with the pseudomonad pathway, the KDG molecule is suggested to be converted to 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phospho-gluconate by 2-keto-3-deoxygluconokinase (A1-K, 35 kDa), and subsequently to d-glyceraldehdye-3-phosphate and pyruvate by 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phospho-gluconate aldolase (A1-A, 24 kDa) (Fig. 8).73In countries around the world, environmental pollution has given rise to a range of serious social problems.11 Soil, air, rivers, seas, waste streams and various sites have been contaminated by the widespread use of chemicals, such as solvents, herbicides, insecticides and many industrial chemicals. A large number of organisms, including humans, suffer from these environmental pollutants as a result of their entry into associated food chains. For example, dioxin is regarded as a typical hazardous compound generated in combustion processes and in certain chemical syntheses of haloaromatics.74 Several physicochemical processes such as high-temperature incineration have been used to eliminate not only dioxin but also other hazardous compounds, although these methods are not always economically viable for the treatment of pollutants when these are present at low concentrations and in soluble/insoluble forms. Bioremediation, a more efficient and convenient biological method using microorganisms and plants, has the potential to augment the removal of hazardous compounds from contaminated sites.Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 (strain RW1), the genome of which has been completely sequenced, can assimilate dibenzofuran, an analogue of dioxin.75 The bacterium has been improved to show an elevated activity for dioxin degradation by metabolic engineering. Thus, the enhancement of import activity of this toxic compound was attempted in strain RW1 cells. The strain A1 superchannel may provide pollutant-degrading sphingomonads with the elevated pollutant import activity. The methods for the transplantation of the superchannel to other bacteria were sought to breed transformants with an elevated transport activity. The lack of an ABC transporter for alginate import through disruption of the AlgS or AlgM1 gene causes failure of pit formation on the strain A1 cell surface and, consequently, an inability to assimilate alginate. This accordingly suggests that the strain A1 gene cluster for alginate import and degradation affects pit formation on the cell surface.20The ability to express the strain A1 superchannel was transferred to strain RW1 cells through introduction of the gene cluster for alginate import and degradation.76 The wild-type cells of strain RW1 formed no pit, whereas a pit was clearly observed on the cell surface of the strain RW1 transformant containing the strain A1 gene cluster (Fig. 9). The transformant cells exhibited a rapid growth on dibenzofuran and only 2 days were required for complete degradation of the compound. The rapid growth was due to the enhanced import of dibenzofuran into the transformant cells. In contrast, the wild-type cells of strain RW1 exhibited a significantly retarded growth on dibenzofuran and took twice as long (4 days) to degrade this toxin. The transformant cells can also lower the concentration of dibenzofuran contaminant in the soil. Other than strain RW1, transplantation of the strain A1 pit has enhanced the efficacy of polypropylene glycol-degrading Sphingomonas subarctica and polydextrose-degrading Sphingomonas sanguis. These transformants rapidly degraded the corresponding macromolecules through constitutive formation of the pit.76Bioremediation through molecular transplantation of the superchannel. Strain RW1 cells with (transformant, red) and without (wild-type, gray) the strain A1 gene cluster were grown in minimal medium containing dibenzofuran as the sole carbon source. Solid and broken lines indicate residual dibenzofuran and cell growth, respectively.Starch and cellulose become important biomasses for a new energy source since fossil fuels are considered to be exhausted near future. Starch is the major carbohydrate in corn grain. This polysaccharide consists of glucose units linked via α-1,4 and/or α-1,6 glycosidic bonds, and it is readily degraded to glucose by glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. The resultant glucose is the best monosaccharide for microbial fermentation to produce ethanol. The utilization of corn grain for bioethanol production does, however, have a disadvantage in that it results in a sharp rise in crop prices due to the competition with foodstuffs. As alternatives to starch, cellulose or lignocellulose abundant in land plants are thought to be potential sources of biomass for biofuel production.77 Cellulose is also a glucose polymer in the crystalline form, although its glucose units are linked by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds. In order to utilize cellulose or lignocellulose as a resource for biofuel production, technical problems regarding how to remove lignin and hydrolyze cellulose still must be overcome. Thermochemical pretreatment, e.g., sulfuric acid treatment at high temperature, is conducted to improve the enzymatic degradation of the polysaccharide through the removal of lignin and hydrolysis of the β-glycosidic linkages. However, this treatment is occasionally expensive and also has a harmful effect on the environment.Marine biomass is, therefore, one of new promising bioenergy sources. Alginate is a major component of brown seaweeds, suggesting that strain A1 cells can be a candidate for bioconversion of alginate to a new energy. In fact, the culture broth of strain A1 cells in the alginate medium includes a trace of ethanol. Thus, the bacterium was improved to enhance the ethanol-producing activity. The α-keto acid produced nonenzymatically from alginate monosaccharides is further degraded to pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate through the successive reactions of cytoplasmic reductase A1-R, kinase A1-K, and aldolase A1-A.73 The tricarbon compounds, pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, are converted to ethanol by the cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Zymomonas mobilis. The E. coli cells transformed with Z. mobilis genes for pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II produce ethanol from glucose.78 Strain A1 cells were also transformed with the two Z. mobilis genes, and the ethanol production ability was examined. The transformant produced ethanol at a concentration of approximately 1% when grown statically on alginate.73 The culture conditions and organization of the introduced gene are currently being optimized for the increased production of biofuels.During a long research in microbiology, strain A1 is the first bacterium with an ability to form a mouth-like pit on the cell surface and incorporate macromolecules through “superchannel.”79 This direct import system of macromolecules in strain A1 cells is superior to the ordinary extracellular degrading enzyme-dependent system for macromolecule assimilation in that, in the latter case, all the degraded products cannot be incorporated within the cells and macromolecule-degrading enzyme must be excreted extracellularly.One of the unexpected findings of the research on strain A1 is that flagellin homologues are localized on the cell surface, and that these homologues exhibit a potent alginate-binding ability. These flagellins are not, however, involved in the formation of flagella. In order to investigate the molecular diversity and evolution of bacterial flagellins, E. coli flagellin (FliC) was purified and characterized. Similar to the strain A1 flagellin homologues, FliC can also associate with alginate, suggesting that alginate binding is common to the bacterial flagellins.25 Other than flagellins that function in cell motility, a plant-pathogenic bacterium, P. syringae, produces flagellum-associated flagellins that induce a hypersensitive reaction in plants.80 The flagellins of human pathogens such as Salmonella and Listeria cause a host innate immune response through interaction with the host's Toll-like receptors.81 The intrinsic function of these flagellins is, however, the formation of flagella. Strain A1 cells produce flagellin homologues not for flagellum formation but for alginate binding. Strain A1 flagellin homologues are exclusively localized on the cell surface. This provides valuable clues as to the origin, evolution, and function of the flagella. One possibility is that a flagellin may have arisen initially as a cell surface protein capable of recognizing external nutrients, and that this protein gradually evolved into flagellar proteins, or vice versa.Research in bioremediation has focused to a large extent on the isolation of microorganisms capable of degrading environmental pollutants and on determining the degradation pathways through gene/enzyme analysis. As described in the introduction, among the pollutant-degrading microbes isolated and characterized to date, sphingomonads are some of the most promising bacteria with respect bioremediation.11 Although sphingomonads can be enhanced for bioremediation by overexpressing pollutant-degrading enzymes through introduction of the corresponding genes, the import of pollutants into the bacterial cells has thus far not been elevated. The strain A1 superchannel is considered to have the potential to enhance the permeability of various compounds across cell membranes. In fact, strain RW1 cells transformed with strain A1 gene cluster for alginate import and degradation show an elevated activity for dibenzofuran import.76 From a practical viewpoint, such results clearly indicate that molecular transplantation of the strain A1 superchannel to pollutant-degrading sphingomonads can be considered as a promising biotechnological approach to tackling environmental pollution.In the future, biofuels such as bioethanol and biodiesel oil, are expected to become new energy sources that replace fossil fuels such as petroleum and coal.82 Currently, bioethanol production processes are being actively investigated, and the production of ethanol from sugar cane and corn grain has already been developed on an industrial scale.83 To the best of our knowledge, ethanol-fermenting microbes such as S. cerevisiae and Z. mobilis convert monosaccharides to ethanol. Saccharification of biomass is therefore one of the most important steps in biofuel production. Polysaccharide-degrading enzymes such as glycoside hydrolases and lyases play an important role in the saccharification of biomass. Aquatic plants such as marine and nonmarine algae have recently been considered as a potential resource for biofuel production.84 For example, gulfweed, a type of seaweed, is abundant in the sea and readily cultivable. Alginate, a major part of this marine biomass, constitutes 30–60% of dried seaweed.85 Strain A1 cells are suitable for biofuel production from alginate because the bacterium can assimilate alginate as a sole carbon source. The exotype alginate lyase A1-IV degrades alginate with various M/G compositions to the constituent monosaccharides, indicating that the enzyme is also suitable for the saccharification of alginate. The recombinant strain A1 cells with a high ethanol-producing activity now become a target of patent for a novel microbe converting marine biomass to bioenergy.73This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid to K.M., B.M. and W.H. and by the Targeted Proteins Research Program (to W.H.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

PMC3032700,Carbohydrate-active enzymes from the zygomycete fungus Rhizopus oryzae: a highly specialized approach to carbohydrate degradation depicted at genome level,False,"Rhizopus oryzae is a zygomycete filamentous fungus, well-known as a saprobe ubiquitous in soil and as a pathogenic/spoilage fungus, causing Rhizopus rot and mucomycoses.Carbohydrate Active enzyme (CAZy) annotation of the R. oryzae identified, in contrast to other filamentous fungi, a low number of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and a high number of glycosyl transferases (GTs) and carbohydrate esterases (CEs). A detailed analysis of CAZy families, supported by growth data, demonstrates highly specialized plant and fungal cell wall degrading abilities distinct from ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The specific genomic and growth features for degradation of easily digestible plant cell wall mono- and polysaccharides (starch, galactomannan, unbranched pectin, hexose sugars), chitin, chitosan, β-1,3-glucan and fungal cell wall fractions suggest specific adaptations of R. oryzae to its environment.CAZy analyses of the genome of the zygomycete fungus R. oryzae and comparison to ascomycetes and basidiomycete species revealed how evolution has shaped its genetic content with respect to carbohydrate degradation, after divergence from the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota.The phylum Zygomycota is a primitive and early diverging group of fungi. Fungal species belonging to this basal fungal lineage are characterized by sexual reproduction via zygospores, asexual reproduction by uni-to multispored sporangia and, in most species, nonseptate (i.e coenocytic) hyphae. The Zygomycota is divided into two classes, the Zygomycetes and the Trichomycetes. The Zygomycetes are an ecologically diverse class of fungi, including both saprobes and pathogens of plants, animals (including humans) and other fungi. Rhizopus oryzae is a member of the order Mucorales, genus of Rhizopus. The order of Mucorales consists of genera such as Mucor, Phycomyces, Rhizopus, Rhizomucor. Although Rhizopus and Mucor are more closely related to each other than either of them to Phycomyces, they are not closely related genera [1]. R. orzyae has been reported as the predominant human-pathogen causing zygomycosis, a highly destructive and lethal infection on immune-compromised hosts [2]. In industry, it is one of the main Rhizopus spp. used in several traditional Asian fermented foods such as tempeh [3]. Furthermore, it is the well-known producer of metabolites such as organic acids (e.g. lactic acid, fumaric acid), ethanol and hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. glucoamylases, polygalacturonases) from pentose sugars and agricultural wastes such as barley, cassava, corn, potato pulp, oats and rice [4-9].R. oryzae has a world-wide distribution with a high prevalence in tropical and subtropical regions. It has been isolated from many substrates, including a wide variety of soils, decaying vegetation, fruit, vegetables, seeds and dung [10]. As a fast growing filamentous fungus, it is known as a primary or secondary colonizer [11], invading quickly on easily accessible and digestible (e.g. rich in simple sugars) substrates. Recently the genome sequence of R. oryzae strain 99-880 has been published [12]. The genome paper focussed mainly on the evolution of the genome, which was shown to include a whole genome duplication event. Expansions of gene families have been observed for specific cellular processes related to the human pathogenic lifestyle such as cell growth and virulence. Little attention was given, however, to the ability of R. oryzae to degrade plant and fungal polysaccharides.Several recent studies have demonstrated a strong relationship between the repertoire of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes, http://www.cazy.org) [13] in fungal genomes and their saprophytic lifestyle [14-17]. These studies focussed in particular on those CAZymes involved in polysaccharide degradation. However, for R. oryzae only two CAZy enzyme families, GH18 (chitinases) [18] and GH28 (polygalacturonases) [19], have been studied in detail. Here we report the CAZy analysis of the R. oryzae and link this annotation to the ability of this fungus to use plant and fungal polysaccharides as carbon source. This will not only provide a better understanding of the ecological role of the R. oryzae, but also of sugar consumption and degradation by zygomycete fungi in comparison to ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi.The putative CAZymes in R. oryzae 99-880 were identified using the CAZy annotation pipeline (Additional File 1) and compared to a selection of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi (Table ​(Table11).Comparative analysis of the number of putative genes in the 5 Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme http://www.cazy.org categories in 15 representative fungal genomes.GH: glycoside hydrolases, GT: glycosyl transferases, PL: polysaccharide lyases, CE: carbohydrate esterases, CBM: carbohydrate-binding modules in 15 fungal species. Numbers of P. placenta were from a dikaryotic strain (possibly 2 alleles per gene).A total of 317 CAZymes have been identified in the R. oryzae genome. This value is similar to the number of CAZymes found in known plant cell wall (PCW) degrading basidiomycetes, higher than for yeasts, but significantly lower than for filamentous ascomycetes (Table ​(Table1).1). A total of 116 glycoside hydrolases were found in the R. oryzae genome, which is lower to what has been found in other filamentous fungi. In contrast, the total number of 130 glycosyl transferases is a very high value by comparison to other fungi (Table ​(Table1).1). Average numbers of polysaccharide lyases (PL), carbohydrate esterases (CE) and carbohydrate binding modules (CBM) were identified in R. oryzae.In the next sections a more detailed comparison between the putative CAZymes in R. oryzae and ascomycete and basidiomycete genomes related to the degradation of PCW polysaccharides (cellulose, xyloglucan, β-1,3-1,4-glucan, xylan, galactomannan, starch, inulin and pectin) is described (Table ​(Table2).2). This analysis will be complemented by that of enzyme activities that may be involved in the metabolism of endogenous or exogenous fungal cell wall (FCW) polysaccharides. Although displayed for comparative purposes, the numbers of CAZy modules of the yeast S. cerevisiae are not included in the discussion, as this organism lacks most of the enzymes involved in the degradation of PCW polysaccharides. As a foreword, the tentative assignment of putative enzymes to specific metabolic pathways found below is meant to reveal the overall ability to deal individually with different polysaccharides. A more rigorous accounting, if ever possible, would only be possible following experimental characterization of many gene products. It should be noted that the CAZy annotations are based upon the protein models derived from the annotation of the genomes. As the pipelines from the JGI and the Broad Institute are not identical, this may cause small differences in the numbers per family that affected the comparison.Number of putative enzyme models for plant cell-wall degradation in different fungal genomes, assigned by substrate category.The number of enzymes in the different functional categories is only a rough estimate and not an absolute count, as functional assignments are sometimes based on remote sequence similarities to biochemically characterized enzymes. Total values obtained per substrate correspond to the theoretical maximum number of active enzymes that could be obtained by adding up all the members of the concerned families (as described in Suplementary Table 2). These values are to be taken as a maximum rather than as absolute values. For Postia placenta, absolute values from the genomic effort on a dikaryon are provided but a monokaryon is estimated to correspond to approximately to 70% of the total provided (Coutinho and Henrissat, unpublished).Degradation of cellulose is achieved by the synergistic action of endoglucanases (endo-β-D-1,4-glucanases) and cellobiohydrolases, assisted by β-glucosidases. It should be noted that β-glucosidases also have other functions than to assist cellulose degradation and therefore not all β-glucosidases may be involved in cellulose breakdown. A total of 21 and 19 candidate cellulolytic enzymes are found in R. oryzae and in U. maydis genomes, respectively, lower than what is observed for the other species (Table ​(Table2).2). P. anserina had the largest set of candidate enzymes (72) related to cellulose degradation, as shown previously [15].Fungal cellobiohydrolases are classified in families GH6 and GH7 and β-glucosidases are found in families GH1 and GH3. The R. oryzae genome contains no protein models belonging to families GH1, GH6, GH7. Moreover, only six GH3 genes were identified in R. oryzae compared while filamentous ascomycetes typically contain more than ten (Table ​(Table2).2). None of the GH3 members were predicted to be β-glucosidases (Additional File 1).R. oryzae contains the largest number of putative enzymes assigned to family GH45 (5) whose characterised members are typically endoglucanases (Additional Files 1 and 2). Three out of these five GH45 ORFs contain a N-terminal CBM1 module (Additional File 1) and have previously been shown to encode functional endoglucanases (rce1, rce2 and rce3) [20,21]. GH45 endoglucanases with a similar N-terminal CBM1 module have been identified in other members of the Mucorales [22], including MCE1 and MCE2 from Mucor circinelloides [23] and PCE1 from Phycomyces nitens [24]. Interestingly, the R. oryzae genome contains four putative protein models of GH9 (Supp. Table ​Table2),2), a family of endoglucanases mostly found in bacteria, plants, and occasionally in animals [25]. GH9 members are absent in all ascomycete filamentous fungi, while basidiomycetes generally encode a single GH9 protein harbouring a C-terminal membrane spanning region (Additional File 2). The role of fungal GH9s remains unclear, but is probably unrelated to cellulose degradation [26]. Finally, R. oryzae does not appear to encode any family GH61 protein, which have been shown to boost cellulose breakdown by cellulases [27,28].Altogether the analysis suggests that the main cellulose-degrading enzymes produced by R. oryzae are GH45 endoglucanases and that the fungus uses them solely to access the plant material. Cellulose is therefore probably not a nutritional source for R. oryzae, as enzymes able to fully degrade cellulose into glucose have not been found.The R. oryzae genome is poor in protein models related to xyloglucan degradation (3) (Table ​(Table2).2). Only U. maydis had a similarly low number, while the other basidiomycete and ascomycete fungi contain 8 to 17 protein models (Additional File 2). The genome appears to contain no xyloglucan-active β-1,4-D-endoglucanase (GH12, 74) nor any side-chain cleaving enzymes such as α-L-fucosidases of families GH29 and GH95 (Additional File 2). The 3 members of family GH31 are candidate α-glucosidases and not likely α-D-xylosidases (Additional File 1).The R. oryzae genome also encodes only a relatively small number of enzymes for the breakdown of β-1,3-1,4-glucans (Table ​(Table2).2). 1,3-1,4-β-Glucans, which are abundant components of the cell walls of grasses [29], are typically hydrolysed by lichenases and endo-1,3-1,4-β-glucanases of family GH16. Eight GH16 protein models were identified in R. oryzae, a low number compared to ascomycete and basidiomycete species (Table ​(Table22).Endoxylanases, commonly found in families GH10 and GH11, cleave the xylan backbone into smaller oligosaccharides, which are degraded further by β-xylosidases to xylose [30]. The R. oryzae genome contains no putative ORFs belonging to either family GH10 or GH11. However, it has been demonstrated that R. oryzae CBS 112.07 produces a low molecular weight endoxylanase [31]. Interestingly, family GH3 or GH43 candidate β-xylosidases were detected in the genome (Additional File 2). The two GH43 members were functionally annotated as candidates for arabinan endo-1, 5-α-L-arabinosidases (Additional File 1). R. oryzae appears to be unable to breakdown xylan significantly as it lacks essential xylanolytic enzymes.. With the exception of R. oryzae and the mycorrhizal basidiomycete L. bicolor (Figure ​(Figure1,1, Additional File 2 and [17]), all other analyzed fungal species contain putative endoxylanases from families GH10 and GH11. The latter two fungi appear to share the inability to degrade xylan with the oomycete P. ultimum [17,32].Growth of R. oryzae and 17 basidiomycete and ascomycete species on monosaccharides (D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-galacturonic acid, D-fructose and D-xylose) and plant polysaccharides (starch, guar gum, citrus pectin, inulin and xylan).The R. oryzae genome contains 13 candidate CAZymes related to the degradation of the main chain and side-chains of galactomannan. This value is similar to that of U. maydis, but significantly lower than that found in the other analyzed species (Table ​(Table2).2). No clear candidate β-endomannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) or β-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25) from families GH2, GH5 and GH26 were found in R. oryzae. Among the few GH5s found in R. oryzae, only one was found to be distantly related to bacterial β-mannosidases (Additional File 1). This constitutes presently the unique candidate enzyme for a possible role in the breakdown of the (gluco)mannan backbone. In A. niger, the presence of a single characterized β-mannosidase (MndA) and β-mannanase (Man5A) has been shown to be sufficient for an efficient degradation of mannan from different sources [33,34].The genome R. oryzae contains a total of six protein models in families GH27 and GH36, mostly described as α-galactosidases (Additional File 1). The enrichment of α-galactosidases in the genome suggests galactose release by R. oryzae, probably for nutritional use, from structural or storage galactoglucomannan, oligosaccharides such as melibiose, raffinose, stachyose, and/or xylan or xyloglucan.The R. oryzae genome contains an average number of candidate CAZymes involved in starch degradation compared to the ascomycetes and basidiomycetes (Table ​(Table2).2). R. oryzae contains the highest number of GH15 enzymes (6), whereas few members from families GH13 (4) and GH31 (3) were detected (Table ​(Table2).2). Four of the six GH15 members were annotated as candidate glucoamylases or related enzymes (Additional File 1). Glucoamylase (AmyA; RO3G_00082.3) has been characterized previously [35], in part due its common usage in the starch industry because of its high activity and stability [36]. One of them has been previously characterized as a glucoamylase (AmyA; RO3G_00082.3) [35] and this enzyme has been commonly used in industry because of high activity and stability [36]. AmyA consists of a C-terminal catalytic domain, connected to an N-terminal starch-binding module of CBM21 by an O-glycosylated linker [37]. Interestingly, a very high number of CBM21-containing protein models (8) containing a CBM21 module were observed in R. oryzae compared to ascomycetes and basidiomycetes (1 - 4) (Additional File 1). Except for AmyA the actual function of these putative proteins is unknown. No catalytic modules were detected for the other seven ORFs, but all eight ORFs contain a putative phosphatase regulatory subunit.Candidate starch-binding CBM20-containing protein models are found in all ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, excepting U. maydis. No CBM20 module is present in the R. oryzae genome, a feature probably functionally compensated by the eight CBM21-containing proteins. Interestingly, most CBM21-containing proteins are found among Eukaryota, contrasts with CBM20s that are equally dispersed among Bacteria and Eukaryota. As expected, none of the other CBM families containing starch-binding modules (CBM25, CBM26, CBM34 and CBM41) were found in the species analysed in this study. They are only found in prokaryotes (mostly Eubacteria) and the only one in Eukaryotes is in picophytotoplanktonic green algae [38].No clear candidate invertases or inulinases could be detected in the genome of R. oryzae. In the R. orzyae NBRC 4785 strain, a glucoamylase (similar to R. oryzae NRRL 395 amyB [39]) with sucrose-hydrolyzing activity has been however reported [40]. AmyB has no starch-binding module and no apparent glucoamylase activity, but it was highly similar to the catalytic module of AmyA (glucoamylase). Only the equivalent AmyA mentioned earlier is found in the genome of R. oryzae strain 99-88 suggesting strain variations within family GH15. Interestingly, Aspergillus starch-degrading glucoamylases have been known for their promiscuity in degrading substrates containing α-linked D-glucosides [41] but no other reports of an ability to degrade sucrose are known.In the R. oryzae genome, pectin degradation appears to be the focus of the highest number of putative CAZymes (27 predicted enzymes in Table ​Table2).2). In comparison to the ascomycete and basidiomycete species, this is an average value. Less pectin-degrading CAZymes were predicted for U. maydis and L. bicolor, while the highest potential for pectin degradation is found in A. nidulans and A. oryzae (with an estimation of 94 and 109 CAZymes each, respectively). The R. oryzae genome is especially rich in family GH28 protein models, with twelve and three genes encoding candidate endopolygalacturonases (EC 3.2.1.15) and exopolygalacturonases (EC 3.2.1.67), respectively [19]. Endopolygalacturonases particularly hydrolyse the α-1,4 linked D-galacturonic acid within the homogalacturonan chain and exo-polygalacturonases hydrolyse this chain from the nonreducing end [30]. Our analysis shows that the enrichment of main-chain degrading enzymes of pectin was accompanied by low numbers of accessory enzymes (Table ​(Table2).2). A possible explanation is that R. oryzae is limited in the degradation of unbranched pectins, unlike most ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi that can degrade a variety of lowly and highly branched pectins.This view fits well with the pre- and/or post harvest pathogenic lifestyle of R. oryzae. As a causal agent of Rhizopus rot, R. oryzae produces endopolygalacturonases for maceration of plant seedlings, fruits and vegetables and plant structures such as flowers, bulbs and tubers [42-44]. The pectin structure in berries, black currants and apples has been shown to contain a high amount of D-galacturonic acid and a small amount of rhamnose residues, indicating the presence of unbranched pectin [45,46]. Rhizopus rot is characterized by the dissolution of the PCW middle lamella in fruits and vegetables, that are typically rich in unbranched pectin (homogalacturonans) with a low degree of methyl esterification [47]. Such dissolution would facilitate accessibility into plant tissue. The natural ability of R. oryzae to degrade unbranched pectin has been exploited in industry, where GH28 endopolygalacturonases has been shown to be very useful in flax-retting (i.e. a process that degrades the smooth regions of pectin for separation of plant fibres) [48-50].In summary, the genome contains mainly enzymes involved in degradation of storage polysaccharides (galactomannan and starch) and the backbone PCW structural polysaccharides (cellulose and pectin). The apparent absence of (i) exo-acting enzymes for cellulose, (ii) accessory enzymes for pectin degradation, and (iii) any enzymes for degradation of xyloglucan, β-1,3-1,4-glucan, xylan and inulin, suggest that these polysaccharides do not serve R. oryzae as a major carbon source. The degrading capacity of R. oryzae allows rapid invasion on and into the substrate, outcompeting secondary and late colonizers that will have to cope with a more extensive degradation of more resistant complex PCW polysaccharides.The CAZy annotation results were compared to the growth profile of two R. oryzae strains (the sequenced isolate 99-880 and the type strain of the species CBS 112.07) and a selection of species from the Fung-Growth database http://www.fung-growth.org on a number of carbon sources (Figure ​(Figure1).1). Overall growth of the type isolate was better than the sequenced isolate. A strong preference for citrus pectin and guar gum (a galactomannan) was observed for R. oryzae 99-880, followed by inulin and starch. This pattern was largely the same for the type isolate, but this strain grew better on starch than the sequenced strain. Good growth on pectin, galactomannan and starch correlates with the presence of related CAZymes in the genome and the occurrence of R. oryzae on fruits, vegetables and seeds [10]. Fruits and vegetables are rich in pectin, whereas seeds are enriched in storage polysaccharides such as galactomannan, starch and inulin. Both R. orzyae strains were able to grow on inulin, despite the absence of known genes required for its degradation. Genome annotation of the oomycete Pythium ultimum initially also identified no candidate invertase [32]. An invertase gene was detected after Blast analysis of the raw nucleotide sequence, indicating that this was missed by the model-building pipeline. In light of this we used the same approach, but failed to identify any putative invertase in the sequenced strain of R. oryzae. Alternative explanations for the growth on inulin could be the presence of traces of other carbon sources in the commercial inulin preparation, or the presence of yet to discover fructofuranosidases.No to poor growth (similar to growth on agar without carbon source) was observed on xylan (Figure ​(Figure1)1) and cellulose (data not shown). Xylan was utilized by all other tested species with the exception of L. bicolor (Figure ​(Figure1).1). This is in agreement with the absence of genes required to degradation of xylan in the genomes of R. oryzae and L. bicolor, and presence in all other tested genomes.Growth on citrus pectin, guar gum, starch and inulin correlated well with growth on their associated monosaccharide components. R. oryzae showed average to good growth on D-galactose and D-mannose, the main components of galactomannan (Figure ​(Figure1).1). The pectin main chain is mainly composed of D-galacturonic acid residues with small amounts of L-rhamnose residues, while the side chains consist of L-arabinose and D-galactose [30]. This correlates well with the ability of R. oryzae to grow on D-galacturonic acid (Figure ​(Figure1)1) and L-rhamnose (data not shown). No growth of P. chrysogenum, L. bicolor, P. anserina and M. grisea was observed on D-galacturonic acid (Figure ​(Figure1).1). In general, fungi do not prefer D-galacturonic acid as a carbon source (de Vries et al, unpublished results). No to poor growth occurred on L-arabinose or D-ribose (data not shown), which strongly suggests that pentose sugars are not preferred by R. oryzae. Growth on D-xylose was observed for R. oryzae CBS 112.07, which confirms a previous study [51]. However, no growth was observed for 99-880 on this substrate, demonstrating a significant difference between the isolates for xylose utilisation. Part of this difference may be due to a poor ability of some R. oryzae strains to germinate on D-xylose [8].The following sections describe the comparison of the number of CAZy family members between R. oryzae and the ascomycete and basidiomycete species that are implicated in the turnover/modification of the fungal cell wall (FCW) polysaccharides chitin, chitosan, α-1,3-glucan, β-1,3-glucan and β-1,6-glucan (Table ​(Table3).3). R. oryzae appears to contain over 40 CAZymes for chitosan degradation/biosynthesis, more than any of the species analyzed so far. The chitin recycling machinery found in R. oryzae, is similar in size to that observed in filamentous ascomycete and basidiomycete species (Table ​(Table3).3). Significantly, low numbers of CAZymes for the degradation of α-1,3-glucan, β-1,3-glucan and β-1,6-glucan were found in R. oryzae when compared to ascomycetes and basidiomycetes.Number of putative enzyme models related to fungal cell wall modification and recycling in different fungal genomes. See note in Table 2 on the confidence of the assignments to functional categories. Numbers of P. placenta were from a dikaryotic strain (possibly 2 alleles per gene).Chitin deacetylases catalyze the deacetylation of chitin to chitosan. In R. oryzae, a very large set of chitin deacetylases of family CE4 is found (Additional File 2). With a total of 34 CE4 models, this is more than three times the previous highest number of CE4s observed in the basidiomycete L. bicolor or in the ascomycete M. grisea. Most of the CE4 proteins in R. oryzae appear to be GPI-anchored (Additional File 1). The biosynthesis of cell wall chitosan, the main cell wall component of zygomycete species [52,53], proceeds by coordinated action of both chitin synthase and chitin deacetylases [54]. The many chitin deacetylases in the R. oryzae genome complement a large set of chitin synthases, previously reported as an expansion compared to ascomycete genomes [12]. The physiological role of chitin deacetylases in R. oryzae is presently unknown but they have been suggested to play roles in FCW biosynthesis in Mucor rouxii and Absidia coerulea and in plant-pathogen interactions in Colletotrichum lindemuthianum and Aspergillus nidulans [55]. Alternatively chitin deacetylases may also be involved in the digestion of chitin, whereby the resulting chitosan would be cleaved by chitosanases. It has been proposed that marine fungi use chitin deacetylases for the decomposition of chitin [53] according to the chitosan pathway [56].Chitosanases (EC 3.2.1.132) have been described in families GH5, GH7, GH8, GH46, GH75, and GH80, the last three containing exclusively chitosanases. All presently characterized GH75 proteins are fungal chitosanases [57]. Members from this family are present in all filamentous ascomycete species, but absent in R. oryzae, in the yeast S. cerevisiae and in all described basidiomycete fungi (Additional File 2). In R. oryzae, one and two proteins from families GH8 and GH46 were identified, respectively (Additional File 2). Our analysis of the corresponding sequences from R. oryzae indicates that they are only distantly related to bacterial chitosanases (Additional File 1). Bacterial chitosanases are known to play a role in the degradation and utilization of exogenous chitosan, whereas fungal chitosanases are assumed to recycle chitosan from the FCW. Production of chitosanases has been demonstrated during autolysis in Mucor rouxi [58].Fungal chitinases from family GH18 are essential for FCW remodelling during growth and development [59]. In R. oryzae, a total of 14 GH18 members was found, a value similar to what is found in known ascomycete and basidiomycete species (Additional File 2). All candidate proteins belonging to family GH18 are likely chitinases in R. orzyae, as previously suggested by phylogenetic analysis [18]. The R. oryzae genome contains four protein models belonging to family GH20 and comparison to functionally characterized enzymes revealed that these members are related to β-N-acetylglucosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.30) or β-N-acetylhexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52). Family CE9 which includes N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylases (EC 3.5.1.25) is important for the metabolism of chitin. R. oryzae has only one family CE9 member, a number similar to ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi. Fungal chitinases have been shown to have diverse roles, such as remodelling of their own cell wall and release of nutrients [60]. It remains unknown, whether these chitinolytic genes of R. oryzae also have a role in nutritional processes. Rhizopus and Mucor species have been shown to use chitinases for hyphal growth and autolysis [61,62]. For other zygomycete fungi such as Mortierella spp, chitinolytic activity has been linked to utilisation of nutrients [56].Both α-1,3-glucosidase and glucan endo-α-1,3-glucosidase are involved in hydrolysis of α-1, 3-glucan. α-1,3-Glucosidases are classified in families GH31 and GH63 and glucan endo-α-1,3-glucosidase in families GH71 and 87. R. oryzae encodes five proteins likely to breakdown α-1,3-glucan degradation, a lower value compared to the filamentous ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, excepting U. maydis. Functional analysis suggests that three members of family GH31 and two of family GH63 are candidate α-glucosidases, but it is unknown if these α-glucosidases could deal specifically with α-1,3-glycoside linkages. Both families are known to contain different enzyme activities, such as α-glucosidases that hydrolyse α-1, 4-linkages. No proteins were found in families GH71 and GH87, known for bearing glucan endo-α-1,3-glucosidases, unlike several ascomycete and basidiomycete genomes that contain GH71 members.β-1,3-Glucanases can be divided into exo-β-1,3-glucanases and endo-β-1,3-glucanases. Four of the seven GH5 members from R. oryzae were functionally annotated as a candidate β-glucosidase related to exo-1,3-β-glucanases (Additional File 1), while five of the six protein models of family GH3 were functionally annotated as a candidate β-glucosidase or exo-1,3-β-glucosidase. R. oryzae also encodes two proteins belonging to family GH72, a family typically containing GPI-anchored β-1,3-glucanosyltransferases. These enzymes are known to play a central role in the cross linking of cell wall β-1,3-glucans to other cell wall β-glucans [63]. The two R. oryzae GH72s are indeed related to characterized β-1,3-glucanosyltransglycosylases, and have a C-terminal GPI-anchor. The cell wall of zygomycetes consists of primarily of chitin and chitosan [52]. However, there is evidence that the cell wall of zygomycetes could contain small amounts of β-1,3-glucan. β-1,3-Glucans have been suggested to participate in the regulation of cell wall morphology in the zygomycete M. rouxii [64]. We have identified three putative 1,3-β-D-glucan synthases (family GT48) encoded by the R. oryzae genome. The likely presence of β-1,3-glucan might explain the recently detected susceptibility of R. oryzae to caspofungin, an antifungal agent which inhibits the 1,3-β-D-glucan synthase [65]. The presence of reduced amounts of β-1,3-glucans in the cell wall does not correlate with the significant numbers of 1,3-β-glucanases in the genome. This could indicate a possible role for the candidate β-1,3-glucanases in the degradation of cell walls of ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, whose cell walls are enriched in chitin and β-1,3-glucans [52,66,67].β-1,6-Glucanases may be found in families GH5 and GH30. The R. orzyae genome contains seven protein models belonging to these two GH families (Table ​(Table3),3), but comparison to biochemically characterized enzymes allowed no clear identification of candidate β-1,6-glucanases in R. orzyae (Additional File 1). This agrees well with the lack of reports on the presence of β-1,6-glucan in the cell wall of R. oryzae.The CAZy annotation results are consistent with growth data of R. oryzae on fungal cell wall polysaccharides and fractions thereof (Figure ​(Figure2).2). Growth of R. oryzae on β-1,3-glucan, chitin and chitosan was comparable to the colony size and density on D-glucose. Significantly improved growth was observed on fungal cell wall fractions of S. cerevisiae, A. niger and A. bisporus (aggregated mycelium) (Figure ​(Figure2),2), but no growth was observed on cell wall fractions of R. oryzae and P. blakesleeanes (data not shown). The zygomycete M. circinelloides showed a similar growth phenotype on cell wall polysaccharides and fractions. In contrast, poor growth of A. niger was observed on β-1,3-glucan, chitin, chitosan and cell wall fractions. All three species showed good growth on N-acetylglucosamine (Figure ​(Figure22).Growth of R. oryzae, M. circinelloides and A. niger on fungal cell wall fractions and polysaccharides.The chitinolytic and β-1,3-glucanolytic enzyme system of R. oryzae could have a role in either nutrition or fungal interactions. Fungal interactions may include inhibition of growth of coexisting fungi, a potential defence system for mycoparasitic competitors such as ascomycete Trichoderma spp. that are known to parasitize a range of fungi [68]. Degradation of chitin, chitosan and/or β-1,3 glucan in the environment can serves as a carbon and nitrogen source for fungi. Recycling of cell wall material of former fungal colonizers has been observed for primary and secondary basidiomycete species of wood during succession [69]. Growth of R. oryzae on chitin and chitosan suggest the ability to digest these polymers in the environment. Together with previous reported locations of isolation, e.g. the soil of salt-marshes [10], our observations are compatible with an adaptation of R. orzyae to inhabit coastal environments.The R. oryzae genome encodes a repertoire of CAZymes distinct of that of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi, suggesting strong evolutionally differences and adaptation to the environment at the genomic level. In contrast to most ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, the set of CAZymes in the R. oryzae genome - supported by the growth profile - reveals the ability to use easily digestible sugars accompanied by an inability to degrade complex plant cell wall polysaccharides. The chitinolytic and glucanolytic enzyme system and the ability to degrade chitin, chitosan, β-1,3-glucan and ascomycete and basidiomycete cell walls suggest a role in both morphological processes and non-plant based nutrition. The differences in hydrolytic potential identified for R. oryzae suggest the development of unique strategies for polysaccharide degradation in the Zygomycota when compared to Basidiomycota and Ascomycota.The fungal strains and culture conditions are listed in Suppl. Table ​Table3.3. Carbon sources were added to the minimal medium (MM) containing 1,5% agar (Merck,101614) at the following concentrations: 1% (w/v) for soluble starch, guar gum, citrus pectin, inulin and beechwood xylan and 25 mM for D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-galacturonic acid, D-fructose and D-xylose (Additional File 3). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.0. The plates were inoculated with 2 μl of 500 spores/μl or a mycelium plug (1 mm diameter). For growth comparison on fungal cell wall fractions and polysaccharides, of Rhizopus oryzae, Mucor circinelloides and Aspergillus niger were grown on plates containing Aspergillus minimal medium [70] and 1,5% agar with 25 mM glucose, or 0.5% (w/v) N-acetylglucosamine, chitin, chitosan, β-1,3-glucan (Additional File 3), or 0.5% (w/v) dried cell wall fractions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, Agaricus bisporus. Plates were inoculated with 5 μl of 500 A. niger spores/μl, or with a plug of R. oryzae or M. circinelloides mycelium. Cultures were grown for 3 days at 25°C.All 17,459 protein-encoding ORFs from the R. oryzae RA 99-880 genome were submitted to analysis using the CAZy annotation pipeline in a two-step procedure of identification and annotation. The identification step of CAZymes follows the procedures previously described [13] where sequences are subject to Blastp analysis [71] against a library composed of modules derived from CAZy, the positive hits are then subject to a modular annotation procedure that maps the individual modules against on the peptide using hits against libraries of catalytic and carbohydrate models derived from CAZy using BlastP or profile Hidden Markov models [71,72]. The results are augmented with signal peptide, transmembrane, and GPI predictions by human curators [73-75]. The fragmentary models and all models suspected of splicing prediction errors are identified. The functional annotation step involves BlastP comparisons against a library modules derived from biochemically characterized enzymes [13]. This manual comparison to identified functions yields three levels of detailed annotation: i) candidate activity, reflects a non-ambiguous assignment thanks to high levels of similarity and/or a large functional homogeneity of the hits; ii) related to activity, reflects a more distant similarity and/or a functional variability of the results; iii) distantly related to activity, reflects a weak degree of similarity to known activities. In most cases a generic activity (ex: α-glycosidase) was equally assigned.Cell wall fractions were isolated as described by Damveld et al.

PMC3033747,Cloning and characterization of a viral α2–3-sialyltransferase (vST3Gal-I) for the synthesis of sialyl Lewisx,False,"Sialyl Lewisx (SLex, Siaα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβOR) is an important sialic acid-containing carbohydrate epitope involved in many biological processes such as inflammation and cancer metastasis. In the biosynthetic process of SLex, α2–3-sialyltransferase-catalyzed sialylation generally proceeds prior to α1–3-fucosyltransferase-catalyzed fucosylation. For the chemoenzymatic synthesis of SLex containing different sialic acid forms, however, it would be more efficient if diverse sialic acid forms are transferred in the last step to the fucosylated substrate Lewisx (Lex). An α2–3-sialyltransferase obtained from myxoma virus-infected European rabbit kidney RK13 cells (viral α2–3-sialyltransferase (vST3Gal-I)) was reported to be able to tolerate fucosylated substrate Lex. Nevertheless, the substrate specificity of the enzyme was only determined using partially purified protein from extracts of cells infected with myxoma virus. Herein we demonstrate that a previously reported multifunctional bacterial enzyme Pasteurella multocida sialyltransferase 1 (PmST1) can also use Lex as an acceptor substrate, although at a much lower efficiency compared to nonfucosylated acceptor. In addition, N-terminal 30-amino-acid truncated vST3Gal-I has been successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli Origami™ B(DE3) cells as a fusion protein with an N-terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) and a C-terminal His6-tag (MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6). The viral protein has been purified to homogeneity and characterized biochemically. The enzyme is active in a broad pH range varying from 5.0 to 9.0. It does not require a divalent metal for its α2–3-sialyltransferase activity. It has been used in one-pot multienzyme sialylation of Lex for the synthesis of SLex containing different sialic acid forms with good yields.Sialic acids belong to an important family of negatively charged monosaccharides. They have a common nine-carbon backbone of a polyhydroxy α-keto acid nature and are usually presented as the terminal residues on cell surface glycoconjugates of higher eukaryotes (Schauer 2000; Angata and Varki 2002; Chen and Varki 2010). The carboxyl group of sialic acids is normally deprotonated under physiological pH (Vimr et al. 2004), which makes them bear a net negative charge that affects their properties. Aside from their common features, sialic acids are structurally diverse in nature with more than 50 different sialic acid forms that have been identified. The diversity includes modifications at the carbon 5 which can link to an acetamido group providing N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), the most abundant sialic acid broadly presented in humans, animals, bacteria and protozoa. A hydroxyacetamido group on carbon 5 leads to N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a nonhuman sialic acid form, and a hydroxyl group at carbon 5 gives 2-keto-3-deoxy-nonulosonic acid (Kdn). Furthermore, additional modifications include single or multiple acetylation at hydroxyl groups at C4, C5, C7, C8 and/or C9, sulfation at C8-OH, phosphorylation or lactylation at C9-OH and methylation at C8-OH, C5-OH (for Kdn), or N-glycolyl hydroxyl group (for Neu5Gc) (Angata and Varki 2002; Schauer 2004; Chen and Varki 2010). Owing to their negative charge, exposed position and diversity, sialic acids play important roles in either masking recognition sites or facilitating cell recognition and adhesion. These biological processes are normally carried out through carbohydrate and protein interactions. Both sialic acids and underlying sugars are involved in determining the binding characteristics of the interactions. Among sialic acid-containing carbohydrates, sialyl Lewisx (SLex) Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβOR is one of the most well-studied structures. SLex is involved in inflammation (Rosen 2004). Its interaction with E-, P-, and L-selectins (Lowe et al. 1990; Phillips et al. 1990; Polley et al. 1991; Foxall et al. 1992; Lasky 1992) facilitates the recruitment of leukocytes to inflammation sites. SLex is also a well-known tumor-associated carbohydrate antigen that is involved in adhesion and metastasis of cancer cells (Takada et al. 1993; Ugorski and Laskowska 2002).Both chemical and enzymatic methods have been developed to study the biological functions of SLex and its potential therapeutic applications such as cancer vaccine candidates. Chemical sialylation in the synthesis of SLex is usually low yielding and complicated by tedious protection and deprotection processes, steric hindrance of sialic acid for sialylation as well as difficulties in choosing suitable protecting groups and controlling stereospecificity (Boons and Demchenko 2000; Halcomb and Chappell 2002; Muthana et al. 2009). Chemically or enzymatically synthesized sialyloligosaccharides have been used as building blocks to improve the synthetic yields of SLex (Hayashi et al. 1996; Hanashima et al. 2007; Cao et al. 2008). Glycosyltransferase-catalyzed enzymatic methods have been developed with or without the regeneration of sugar nucleotides (Ichikawa et al. 1992; DeFrees et al. 1993, 1995; Lin et al. 1995; Duffels et al. 2000; Koeller and Wong 2000; Huang et al. 2006; Soriano del Amo et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2010). Nevertheless, only Neu5Ac, the most abundant sialic acid form, was the sialic acid form in previous SLex synthetic targets.In order to study the importance of naturally occurring sialic acid forms in SLex, instead of following its natural biosynthetic pathway in which sialylation takes place before fucosylation, a more efficient enzymatic synthetic approach would be to carry out the fucosylation before the final sialylation process to introduce diverse sialic acid forms. Although most bacterial α1–3-fucosyltransferases can tolerate both sialylated and nonsialylated N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) as acceptors (Lin et al. 2006; Soriano del Amo et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2010), α2–3-sialyltransferases are usually restricted to nonfucosylated galactoside acceptors. Therefore, the key issue for efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of SLex-containing diverse sialic acid forms is to find an α2–3-sialyltransferase that can tolerate fucosylated galactoside Lex as acceptor substrate.Among reported α2–3-sialyltransferases, a viral α2–3-sialyltransferase (vST3Gal-I) was shown to be able to tolerate fucosylated acceptors (Jackson et al. 1999; Sujino et al. 2000). The sialyltransferase was classified together with mammalian sialyltransferases in Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy, http://www.cazy.org/) glycosyltransfersae family 29 (GT 29; Coutinho et al. 2003; Cantarel et al. 2009). This vST3Gal-I, encoded by myxoma virus gene MST3N, was obtained from RK13 cells (European rabbit kidney cells) infected with myxoma virus (Jackson et al. 1999; Sujino et al. 2000). Partially purified extracts of the cells were used to test the acceptor substrate specificity of vST3Gal-I. It was shown that the enzyme sialylated both Lewisx and Lewisa with relative Vmax of 30 and 40%, respectively, compared to that of LacNAc (Sujino et al. 2000). Nevertheless, the vST3Gal-I has not been purified to homogeneity and hence the detailed kinetics data were not available.Herein we report the cloning, expression (in Escherichia coli), purification and characterization of an N-terminal truncated vST3Gal-I as a fusion protein with an N-terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) and a C-terminal His6-tag (MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6). Its activities toward fucosylated LacNAc (Lewisx) and nonfucosylated lactoside were compared. In addition, the tolerance of fucosylated LacNAc as an acceptor by a previously reported multifunctional Pasteurella multocida sialyltransferase 1 (PmST1 or tPm0188Ph; Yu et al. 2005; Ni et al. 2006, 2007) was demonstrated and compared to the recombinant vST3Gal-I. Partially purified recombinant vST3Gal-I was used in one-pot multienzyme sialylation of Lex for the synthesis of SLex containing different sialic acid forms with good yields.The amino-acid sequence of vST3Gal-I shares high identity to mouse ST3Gal-IV (37%) (Sujino et al. 2000), human ST3Gal-IV (38%) (Sasaki et al. 1993; Kitagawa and Paulson 1994), human ST3Gal-III (36%) (Kitagawa and Paulson 1993) and porcine ST3Gal-I (26%) whose X-ray crystal structure was recently reported (Rao et al. 2009). As shown in Figure 1, vST3Gal-I has all four conserved sialyl motifs including large (L), small (S), motif 3 and very small (VS) motifs identified previously (Datta and Paulson 1995; Geremia et al. 1997; Datta et al. 1998, 2001; Jeanneau et al. 2004). In addition, it has conserved amino-acid residues (shown by asterisks in Figure 1) including a conserved catalytic base H268 in sialyl motif VS identified in the porcine ST3Gal-I X-ray crystal structures (Rao et al. 2009).

As shown in Figure 2, the codon-optimized Δ30vST3Gal-I gene contained 24% adenine, 27% cytosine, 25% guanine and 24% thymine as compared to the original sequence containing 28% adenine, 25% cytosine, 23% guanine and 24% thymine (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""U46578.1"",""term_id"":""4097181"",""term_text"":""U46578.1""}}U46578.1). The recombinant protein was obtained as a fusion protein with an N-terminal MBP and a C-His6-tag. The MBP tag was introduced by using pMAL-c4X vector, while the C-His6-tag was introduced by including the His6-tag codons in the 3′-primer used for cloning. Optimal expression was achieved by incubating E. coli Origami™ B(DE3) cells at 20°C for 24 h with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) after the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) (0.5 mM) for induction. Sodium dodecylsulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) analysis (Figure 3) indicated that the recombinant protein was overexpressed which constituted about 70% of the total protein in the whole-cell extraction. Nevertheless, only a small portion of the recombinant protein was seen in the cell lysate, the soluble portion of the cell extraction. Ni2+-NTA column purification of the fusion protein using an ÄKTATM fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system yielded the purified protein, showing a molecular weight of around 72 kDa in the SDS–PAGE. The molecular weight was similar to that calculated (72.5 kDa) for the MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6.

Lanes: 1, protein standard; 2, whole-cell extraction before induction; 3, whole-cell extraction after induction; 4, cell lysates after induction; 5, Ni-column purified fraction.High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based pH profile study using a 4-methylumbelliferyl (MU)-labeled lactose (LacβMU or Galβ1–4GlcβMU) as an acceptor substrate demonstrated that MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 was active in a wide pH range varying from 5.5 to 8.5 with minimum variation of activity (Figure 4). About 80% of the optimum activity was observed at pH 5.0 and 9.0. The activity decreased drastically when the pH was below 5.0 or above 9.0. Only about 20% of the optimum activity was observed at pH 4.5 and 11.0.
The pH profile of MBP-D30vST3Gal-I-His6. Activity was measured at indicated pH at 37°C for 30 min. Buffers (200 mM) used: sodium acetate (pH 4.5), MES (pH 5.0–6.5), HEPES (pH 7.0–7.5), Tris–HCl (pH 8.0–9.0), 3-(cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid (pH 9.5–11.0).Both fluorophore-tagged lactoside (LacβMU) and Lewisx (LexβMU) were tolerable acceptor substrates by the MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6. As shown in Table I, LacβMU was a preferred acceptor for MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 compared to LexβMU. Compared to LexβMU as an acceptor (kcat/Km = 1.5 mM−1 min−1), the catalytic efficiency of the recombinant viral enzyme was 19 times greater when LacβMU was used as an acceptor (kcat/Km = 28 mM−1 min−1). The difference was contributed by both a lower Km and a higher kcat value for LacβMU. Nevertheless, when LacβMU was used as an acceptor, the α2–3-sialyltransferase activity of MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 was much weaker (about 70-fold difference) than a previously reported multifunctional P. multocida α2–3-sialyltransferase (PmST1; Yu et al. 2005; Ni et al. 2006, 2007). Quite interestingly, LexβMU was also a tolerable acceptor substrate for PmST1. When LexβMU was used as an acceptor, the catalytic efficiency of PmST1 (kcat/Km = 23 mM−1 min−1) was actually 15 times higher than that of MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 (kcat/Km = 1.5 mM−1 min−1). Nonetheless, this PmST1 activity with LexβMU acceptor was 87-fold less efficient compared to the PmST1 activity with LacβMU acceptor due to a much (about 13-fold) higher Km value and a much (7-fold) lower kcat value for LexβMU.
Apparent kinetic parameters of recombinant MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 and PmST1a,Yu et al. (2005).In order to confirm that Lex was indeed a tolerable acceptor for the α2–3-sialyltransferase activity of MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6, a preparative-scale synthesis of SLex tetrasaccharide Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβProN3 was carried out from Lex trisaccharide Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβProN3, Neu5Ac and cytidine 5′-triphosphate (CTP) using a one-pot two-enzyme reaction (Figure 5) containing partially purified recombinant sialyltransferase MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 and a recombinant Neisseria meningitidis CMP-sialic acid synthetase (NmCSS; Yu et al. 2004). The presence of NmCSS allowed in situ synthesis of CMP-Neu5Ac, the sugar nucleotide donor for MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6, from inexpensive, commercially readily available Neu5Ac and CTP. SLex Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβProN3 was obtained in a yield of 61%. The product was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) studies. As shown in Table II, comparing the 13C NMR chemical shifts of the purified product and the starting trisaccharide Lex indicated a significant downfield shift (72.58 ppm to 75.82 ppm) of the C-3 signal of the galactose (Gal) residue in the product and a moderate upfield shift (71.16 ppm to 69.43 ppm) of the neighboring C-4 signal in the Gal. This confirmed that the sialylation took place at the C-3 of the Gal in Lex. High resolution mass spectrometry electrospray ionization (HRMS ESI) spectrum obtained showed the desired m/z of 926.3309 for C34H57N5O23Na (M+Na) (calculated: 926.3342).

Enzymes used: MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 and a recombinant NmCSS.To demonstrate the application of MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 in enzymatic synthesis of SLex containing different sialic acid forms from Lex, partially purified MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 was used with NmCSS (Yu et al. 2004) and a recombinant P. multocida sialic acid aldolase (Li et al. 2008) in a one-pot three-enzyme system (Yu et al. 2005, 2006) for the preparative-scale synthesis of SLex tetrasaccharides Kdnα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβProN3 and Neu5AcN3α2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβProN3 from mannose and N-azidoacetylmannosamine (ManNAcN3; Yu et al. 2005), respectively, in the presence of Lex, sodium pyruvate, CTP and MgCl2. In this system, aldolase catalyzed the formation of Kdn and N-azidoacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5AcN3) from mannose and ManNAcN3 in the presence of an excess amount of pyruvate. These sialic acids were converted into their activated CMP-sialic acid by NmCSS which were used by the viral sialyltransferase to transfer sialic acids to Lex for the formation of SLex containing different sialic acid forms. SLex tetrasaccharides Kdnα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβProN3 and Neu5AcN3α2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβProN3 were formed with 64% and 58% yields, respectively. The products were confirmed by NMR as shown in Table II and HRMS studies. Similar to that observed for Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβProN3, a significant downfield shift of the C-3 signal of the Gal residue in the product and a moderate upfield shift of the neighboring C-4 signal in the Gal were observed in the 13C NMR spectra of both products when compared to that of Lex starting material, indicating the formation of a 2–3-sialyl linkage. HRMS (ESI) spectrum obtained showed the desired m/z of 885.3103 for Kdn-containing SLex C32H54N4O23Na (M+Na) (calculated: 885.3077) and 967.396 for Neu5AcN3-containing SLex C34H56N8O23Na (calculated: 967.3356).Synthesizing SLex with different sialic acid forms is crucial to understand the importance of structural diversity of naturally occurring sialic acids and to generate nonnatural carbohydrate probes. Variation of sialic acid structures, especially at the C-5 position, has been demonstrated to enhance the immunogenicity of some carbohydrate vaccines (Livingston 1995; Liu et al. 2000; Lemieux and Bertozzi 2001; Krug et al. 2004; Zou et al. 2004; Pan et al. 2005). We demonstrate here that SLex oligosaccharides containing natural and nonnatural sialic acid forms can be directly synthesized by enzyme-catalyzed sialylation of fucose-containing acceptor Lex.  Although viral vST3Gal-I and bacterial PmST1 do not share significant protein sequence homology and belong to different CAZy glycosyltransferase families (GT 29 and GT 80, respectively), both have α2–3-sialyltransferase activity and can tolerate nonfucosylated and fucosylated galactosides as acceptors. Nonetheless, their activities toward fucosylated acceptors are much lower than the nonfucosylated acceptor substrates. We have successfully demonstrated here that the flexible acceptor substrate specificity of vST3Gal-I can be applied in a previously described one-pot three-enzyme sialylation system containing a sialic acid aldolase, a CMP-sialic acid synthetase and a suitable sialyltransferase (Yu et al. 2005, 2006) to introduce different sialic acid structures onto Lex to generate structurally diverse SLex and analogs. In comparison, the application of PmST1 in sialylation of LexβMU for the formation of Neu5Acα2–3LexβMU was unsuccessful as less than 5% yields were observed by HPLC assays due to its strong donor hydrolysis activity (data not shown). Nevertheless, the relatively low expression level of soluble and active vST3Gal-I hampers its application in large-scale synthesis of SLex. Due to the high expression level and high activity of PmST1, generating PmST1 mutants with increased activity toward fucosylated acceptors may be a preferred approach to achieve efficient synthesis of SLex with diverse sialic acid forms.Compared to the common biosynthetic route for the formation of SLex structure with α2–3-sialylation followed by α1–3-fucosylation, enzymatic synthesis with an alternative glycosylation sequence of α1–3-fucosylation followed by α2–3-sialylation has a great advantage for introducing different sialic acid forms in the last step. Obtaining a sialyltransferase that can tolerate fucosylated acceptor substrate (e.g. Lex), such as the recombinant vST3Gal-I described here, provides an efficient catalyst to do so. With the availability of MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 by expression in E. coli system, SLex with diverse naturally occurring and nonnatural sialic acid forms can be obtained from a common acceptor substrate Lex and a sialic acid precursor such as mannose, ManNAc or their derivatives, using an efficient one-pot three-enzyme system containing the sialyltransferase, a sialic acid aldolase and a CMP-sialic acid synthetase.vST3Gal-I has high sequence homology with mouse ST3Gal-IV (Kono et al. 1997) and human ST3Gal-IV (Sasaki et al. 1993; Kitagawa and Paulson 1994). Similar to human placenta hST3Gal-IV expressed in COS-1 cells which showed marginal activity toward Lex with the relative rate of the reaction 33-fold less than that of type-II acceptor (Kitagawa and Paulson 1994), the recombinant MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 shows a 19-fold less efficiency in its sialyltransferase activity toward Lex acceptor (LexβMU) compared to an acceptor (LacβMU) closely resembling type-II glycan.As shown in Figures 1 and ​and2,2, vST3Gal-I has several potential N-linked glycosylation sites at 34, 45, 95, 147 and 283 (Jackson et al. 1999) with conserved NxS/T where x is any amino acid other than a proline. We demonstrate in this report that similar to pST3Gal-I (Rao et al. 2009), glycosylation of vST3Gal-I is not essential for its activity in vitro.E. coli electrocompetent cells DH5α were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) and chemically competent Origami™ B(DE3) from Novagen (Madison, WI). EcoRI and SalI restriction enzymes as well as vector plasmid pMAL-c4X were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Ni2+-NTA agarose (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose), QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit and QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Herculase-enhanced DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). T4 DNA ligase and 1 kb DNA ladder were from Promega (Madison, WI). Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit was from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. (Rockford, IL). CTP, d-N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and sodium pyruvate were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Full-length vST3Gal-I synthetic gene with the codons optimized for E. coli expression system was custom-synthesized by Codon Devices, Inc. (Cambridge, MA).CMP-Neu5Ac was synthesized enzymatically from ManNAc, sodium pyruvate and CTP by a one-pot two-enzyme system using a recombinant sialic acid aldolase cloned from E. coli K12 and a recombinant NmCSS as described previously (Yu et al. 2004).LacβMU was synthesized from lactose through a hepta-O-acetyllactosyl trichloroacetimidate intermediate as reported by Yu et al. (2005). The synthesis of LacNAcβProN3 was carried out as described previously (Chokhawala et al. 2008).Both LexβProN3 and LexβMU were synthesized from the corresponding LacNAc derivatives LacNAcβProN3 and LacNAcβMU using a one-pot two-enzyme system containing a recombinant N-His6-tagged C-terminal truncated Helicobacter pylori α1–3-fucosyltransferase (Hp1-3FTΔ66; Sun et al. 2007) and a recombinant bifunctional L-fucokinase/GDP-fucose pyrophosphorylase (FKP) from Bacteroides fragilis (Yi et al. 2009). To synthesize LewisxβProN3, LacNAcβProN3 (47 mg, 0.10 mmol), L-fucose (25 mg, 0.15 mmol), adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) (84 mg, 0.15 mmol), guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) (79 mg, 0.15 mmol) and MgCl2 (41 mg, 0.20 mmol) were dissolved in H2O (5 mL). A stock solution of Tris–HCl buffer (1 M, pH 7.5, 1 mL) was added. After the addition of a recombinant FKP (3.4 mg) which catalyzes the synthesis of GDP–fucose from L-fucose, ATP and GTP via a fucose-1-phosphate intermediate and Hp1–3FTΔ66 (2.2 mg), water was added to bring the volume of the reaction mixture to 10 mL. The reaction mixture was then incubated in an incubator shaker at 37°C for 48 h. The reaction was stopped by adding cold EtOH (10 mL). The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and was centrifuged to remove precipitates. The supernatant was concentrated by rotavaporation. A Bio-Gel P-2 filtration column and a silica gel column (eluted with EtOAc:MeOH:H2O = 7:2:1, v/v/v) were used to purify the product LexβProN3 Galβ1–4(Fuc1–3)GlcNAcβProN3 (40 mg, 65% yield). The LexβMU Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβMU was synthesized similarly with a 59% yield.To clone MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 in pMAL-c4X vector, the forward primer used was 5′-CCGGAATTCGGTACGAACAACGTTTCAG-3′ (EcoRI restriction site is underlined) and the reverse primer used was 5′-ACGCGTCGACTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGCGGATACACAGAATG-3′ (SalI restriction site is underlined and the sequence encoding the hexahistidine tag is italicized). Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) for amplifying the target gene were performed in a 50 μL of reaction mixture containing plasmid DNA (10 ng), forward and reverse primers (0.2 μM each), 10× Herculase buffer (5 μL), dNTP mixture (0.2 mM) and 5 U (1 μL) of Herculase-enhanced DNA polymerase. The reaction mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of amplification at an annealing temperature of 53°C. The resulted PCR product was purified and double-digested with EcoRI and SalI restriction enzymes. The digested PCR product was purified, ligated with the predigested pMAL-c4X vector and transformed into electrocompetent E. coli DH5α cells. Selected clones were grown for minipreps and characterization by restriction mapping. DNA sequencing was performed by the Davis Sequencing Facility in the University of California-Davis.The plasmids of positive clones were selected and transformed into E. coli Origami™ B(DE3) chemically competent cells. The plasmid-bearing E. coli strain was cultured in an LB-rich medium (10 g L−1 tryptone, 5 g L−1 yeast extract and 10 g L–1 NaCl) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg mL–1). Overexpression of the target protein was achieved by inducing the E. coli culture with 0.5 mM IPTG when the OD600 nm of the culture reached 1.0 followed by incubating the induced culture at 20°C for 24 h with vigorous shaking at 250 rpm in a C25KC incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ).His6-tagged target protein was purified from cell lysates. To obtain the cell lysate, cell pellets harvested by centrifugation at 3452 × g for 2 h were resuspended in lysis buffer (pH 8.0, 100 mM Tris–HCl containing 0.1% Triton X-100) (20 mL for cells obtained from 1 L of cell culture). Lysozyme (50 μg mL–1) and DNaseI (3 μg mL–1) were then added and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 min with vigorous shaking. Cell lysates were obtained as the supernatant after centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 20 min. Purification of His6-tagged proteins from the lysate was achieved using an AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare) equipped with a HisTrap™ FF 5 mL column. The column was pre-equilibrated with 10 column volumes of binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5) before the lysate was loaded. After washing with 10 column volumes of binding buffer, stepwise gradient elution was carried out sequentially with 10 column volumes of elute buffers containing 34.25, 102.5 and 200 mM imidazole, respectively, in Tris–HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl). The fractions containing the purified enzyme were collected and stored at 4°C.The concentration of purified enzyme was obtained in a 96-well plate using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) with bovine serum albumin as a protein standard. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 562 nm by a BioTek Synergy™ HT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader.SDS–PAGE was performed in a 12% Tris–glycine gel using a Bio-Rad Mini-protein III Cell Gel Electrophoresis Unit (Bio-Rad) at a DC voltage of 120 V. Bio-Rad Precision Plus Protein Standards (10–250 kDa) were used as molecular weight standards. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue.Assays were performed in a total volume of 10 μL in a buffer (200 mM) with pH varying from 4.5 to 11.0 containing CMP-Neu5Ac (1 mM), LacβMU (1 mM) and MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 (0.3 μg). The buffers used were: sodium acetate, pH 4.5; MES, pH 5.0–6.5; HEPES, pH 7.0–7.5; Tris–HCl, pH 8.0–9.0; 3-(cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid, pH 9.5–11.0. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 37°C for 30 min before being quenched by adding 10 μL of ethanol. An aliquot (2 μL) of the mixture was then added to 138 μL of 25% acetonitrile to make 70-fold dilutions. The samples were then kept on ice until aliquots of 8 μL were injected and analyzed by a Shimadzu LC-6AD system equipped with a membrane on-line degasser, a temperature control unit and a fluorescence detector (Shimadzu RF-10AXL). A reversed-phase Premier C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size, Shimadzu) protected with a C18 guard column cartridge was used. The mobile phase was 25% acetonitrile. The fluorescent compounds LacβMU and Neu5Acα2–3LacβMU were detected by excitation at 325 nm and emission at 372 nm (Yu et al. 2005). All assays were carried out in duplicates.The recombinant PmST1 was expressed as a His6-tag protein and purified using an ÄKTATM FPLC system (GE Healthcare) equipped with a HisTrap™ FF 5 mL column as previously described (Yu et al. 2005).The enzymatic assays were carried out in a total volume of 10 μL in a Tris–HCl buffer (200 mM, pH 8.0) containing CMP-Neu5Ac, acceptor substrates (LacβMU or LexβMU) and the recombinant proteins (MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 or PmST1). All reactions for the MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 were allowed to proceed at 37°C for 60 min. The PmST1 reactions with LexβMU acceptor were allowed to proceed for 7 min at 37°C. Apparent kinetic parameters of CMP-Neu5Ac for MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 (0.2 μg was used) were obtained by varying the CMP-Neu5Ac concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mM), while the concentration of LacβMU was fixed at 1 mM. Kinetic parameters of LacβMU (concentrations used were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0 and 8.0 mM) and LexβMU (concentrations used were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 14.0 mM) for MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 (0.3 and 0.4 μg were used for determining the parameters for LacβMU and LexβMU, respectively) were obtained with a fixed concentration of CMP-Neu5Ac (1 mM). The same concentration of CMP-Neu5Ac (1 mM) was used for the kinetic study of PmST1 (40 ng was used) on LexβMU (concentrations used were 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0 and 35.0 mM). Apparent kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data (the average values of duplicate assay results) into the Michaelis–Menten equation using Grafit 5.0.For the synthesis of Neu5Acα2–3LexβProN3, LexβProN3 (21 mg, 0.03 mmol), Neu5Ac (16 mg, 0.05 mmol), CTP (29 mg, 0.05 mmol) and MgCl2 (22 mg, 0.11 mmol) were dissolved in H2O (2.5 mL). A stock solution of Tris–HCl buffer (1 M, pH 8.5, 0.5 mL) was added. After the addition of a recombinant N. meningitidis CMP–sialic acid synthetase (1.1 mg) (Yu et al. 2004) and Ni2+-NTA column purified MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 (262 μg, estimated), water was added to bring the volume of the reaction mixture to 5 mL. The reaction was carried out by incubating the solution in an incubator shaker at 37°C for overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding cold EtOH (5 mL) followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The mixture was then centrifuged to remove precipitates. The supernatant was concentrated by rotavaporation. A BioGel P-2 filtration column and a silica gel column (eluted with EtOAc:MeOH:H2O = 5:2:1, v/v/v) were used to purify the product SLexβProN3Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1–4(Fucα1–3)GlcNAcβProN3 (19 mg, 61% yield).For the synthesis of Kdnα2–3LexβProN3 and Neu5AcN3α2–3LexβProN3, LexβProN3 (20 mg, 0.03 mmol), mannose (9 mg, 0.05 mmol) or ManNAcN3 (Yu et al. 2005) (12 mg, 0.05 mmol), sodium pyruvate (18 mg, 0.16 mmol), CTP (28 mg, 0.05 mmol) and MgCl2 (22 mg, 0.11 mmol) were dissolved in H2O (2.5 mL). A stock solution of Tris–HCl buffer (1 M, pH 8.5, 0.5 mL) was added. After the addition of a recombinant P. multocida sialic acid aldolase (Li et al. 2008) (1.7 mg), a recombinant N. meningitidis CMP–sialic acid synthetase (Yu et al. 2004) (1.1 mg), and Ni2+-NTA column purified MBP-Δ30vST3Gal-I-His6 (262 μg, estimated), water was added to bring the volume of the reaction mixture to 5 mL in both reactions. The reactions were carried out by incubating the solution in an incubator shaker at 37°C for overnight. The reactions were stopped by adding cold EtOH (5 mL) followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The mixtures were then centrifuged to remove precipitates. The supernatants were concentrated by rotavaporation. A BioGel P-2 filtration column and a silica gel column (eluted with EtOAc:MeOH:H2O = 5:2:1, v/v/v) were used to purify the product SLexβProN3Kdnα2–3LexβProN3 (18 mg, 64% yield) and Neu5AcN3α2–3LexβProN3 (18 mg, 58% yield).This work was supported by NIH grant R01GM076360.

PMC3044236,Fungal arabinan and l-arabinose metabolism,False,"
l-Arabinose is the second most abundant pentose beside d-xylose and is found in the plant polysaccharides, hemicellulose and pectin. The need to find renewable carbon and energy sources has accelerated research to investigate the potential of l-arabinose for the development and production of biofuels and other bioproducts. Fungi produce a number of extracellular arabinanases, including α-l-arabinofuranosidases and endo-arabinanases, to specifically release l-arabinose from the plant polymers. Following uptake of l-arabinose, its intracellular catabolism follows a four-step alternating reduction and oxidation path, which is concluded by a phosphorylation, resulting in d-xylulose 5-phosphate, an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway. The genes and encoding enzymes l-arabinose reductase, l-arabinitol dehydrogenase, l-xylulose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase, and xylulokinase of this pathway were mainly characterized in the two biotechnological important fungi Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei. Analysis of the components of the l-arabinose pathway revealed a number of specific adaptations in the enzymatic and regulatory machinery towards the utilization of l-arabinose. Further genetic and biochemical analysis provided evidence that l-arabinose and the interconnected d-xylose pathway are also involved in the oxidoreductive degradation of the hexose d-galactose.The monosaccharide l-arabinose is an aldopentose and the second most abundant pentose beside d-xylose in plants. Although most monosaccharides are normally present in nature in their d-form, l-arabinose is a rare exception to this rule and found mainly in its furanose form as a component of the plant biopolymers hemicellulose and pectin. Studies on the catabolic pentose pathway, which includes beside l-arabinose the interconnected d-xylose catabolism has received less attention in previous years. One reason might be that both pathways are not present in the conventional Saccharomyces cerevisiae laboratory strains strain, and only recently, d-xylose fermenting wild-type isolates were described (Wenger et al. 2010). However, due to the increased interest in conversion of plant biomass to biofuels/ethanol and other bioproducts, such as xylitol, etc, the catabolism of these pentoses has now received a strong attention. A fungal d-xylose catabolic pathway was established much earlier, which might be due to the fact that the lignocellulosic food stocks contain, on average, much less l-arabinose than d-xylose (e.g., corn stover contains 19% xylan and 3% arabinan, wheat bran contains 19% xylan, and 15% arabinan (Hayn et al. 1993)), and that the l-arabinose path needs five enzymes, while d-xylose only three enzymes for the conversion to d-xylulose 5-phosphate (Fig. 2). Both fungal d-xylose and l-arabinose pathways were introduced into S. cerevisiae strains to improve conversion of these pentoses to ethanol (for a review: Hahn-Hägerdal et al. 2007). In addition, numerous new arabinan degrading enzymes were characterized within the last years and can now be used to supplement available enzyme mixtures for a faster and more complete conversion of l-arabinose and arabinan containing feed stocks. This mini review focuses on fungi, with particular emphasis on A. niger and T. reesei (syn. Hypocrea jecorina) but will exclude most of the available data on yeasts. After a short survey on the extracellular arabinanolytic degradation system, special attention will be paid to the elucidation of the components of the catabolic l-arabinose pathway, their role in d-galactose utilization, and the regulation of the arabinanolytic pathway.
l-arabinose and d-xylose catabolism in fungi. The first step of the l-arabinose pathway is catalyzed by two different aldose reductases. In A. niger, the l-arabinose-specific reductase (LarA) is responsible for the main activity, while in T. reesei the d-xylose reductase XYL1 is responsible for the first step in l-arabinose assimilation. The last two shared steps of the two pentose catabolic pathways result in d-xylulose 5-phosphate, which is further assimilated via the pentose phosphate pathwayIn the plant cell wall, l-arabinose is present in arabinoxylan, arabinogalactan, and arabinan. Due to the diversity of the structures, different hydrolases are needed for the release of l-arabinose residues from these polymers. The complete degradation of hemicellulose and pectin requires the concerted action of many different arabinanolytic enzymes (Fig. 1). Endo-processive arabinanases (Arabinan endo-1,5-α-l-arabinosidase; EC 3.2.1.99) cut randomly within the backbone of the arabinan, while exo-acting α-l-arabinofuranosidases (ABF, α-N-arabinofuranosidase, EC 3.2.1.55) release terminal non-reducing α-l-arabinofuranoside residues from different α-l-arabinosides, arabinans, arabinoxylans, and arabinogalactans. In addition, arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolases (AXH) specifically remove arabinofuranose side chains that are linked to backbone d-xylose residues and exo-α-1,5-l-arabinanases release l-arabinose or short arabino-oligosaccharides. α-l-Arabinofuranoside activities are also found in a group of β-xylosidases, and some xylanases are also involved in arabinan degradation (de Vries and Visser 2001). All these enzymes, their genomic, structural and biochemical information are found in carbohydrate-active enzyme database (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/), which divides the structural-related catalytic modules of the enzymes in different glycoside hydrolase (GH) families (Cantarel et al. 2009). In the following, only a general overview will be given. Their biotechnological applications, including improvement of wine flavors, pulp treatment, juice clarification, production of important medicinal compounds, and bioethanol, was reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Numan and Bhosle 2006; Saha 2000; Shallom and Shoham 2003).

Degradation of different l-arabinose polymers in pectin. Different types of arabinan and arabinogalactan are present as side chains of rhamnogalacturonan I in pectin. Endo-processive arabinanases (ABN) attack randomly the backbone of arabinan, while exo-acting α-l-arabinofuranosidases (ABF) release the terminal α-l-arabinofuranoside residuesThe best studied group and by far the most complex one are the ABFs. They belong to the catalysts with highest efficiency known (Rye and Withers 2000; Shallom et al. 2002). ABFs are grouped mainly in four families GH43, GH51, GH54, and GH62 (Cantarel et al. 2009) and hydrolyse (1 → 2), (1 → 3), (1 → 5) α-l-arabinofuranosyl linkages. ABFs were previously classified according to their substrate specificity in (1) ABFAs (GH51) which are not active towards arabinan, (2) in polymer hydrolyzing ABFBs (GH54, GH43), and (3) AXHs specific for arabinoxylans (Beldman et al. 1997). However, since the substrate specificity differs within a single GH family, the CAZy classification is now generally accepted (Saha 2000). ABFs hydrolyze glycosidic bonds via acid/base-assisted catalysis, which can lead either to retention (GH3, GH51 and GH54) or inversion (GH43) of the anomeric configuration (Zechel and Withers 2000; de Groot et al. 2003; Numan and Bhosle 2006). GH54 enzymes have a specifically adapted two domain structure, which includes a catalytic and a substrate binding domain. This carbohydrate-binding module (CBM42 family) is specific for monomeric l-arabinose residues of polysaccharides. This binding side plays an effective role in the degradation of insoluble pectin and arabinoxylan, as mutations in the CBM42 resulted in a decreased activity (Miyanaga et al. 2006). The close binding to l-arabinose residues and its hydrolysis may be the result of a fine-tuning link from arabino-oligosaccharides to cellulose degradation where the cellulose microfibrils are in close interaction with hemicelluloses, containing l-arabinose residues (Zykwinska et al. 2005). Recent studies revealed that the genome of Penicillium funiculosum contains four GH54 ABF with three conventional GH54 ABF, while in one ABF, CBM42 is replaced by a 100 aa shorter cellulose-binding domain CBM1 (Guais et al. 2010).Endo-arabinanases belong to the GH43 family, which contains also ABFs and β-xylosidases. Endo-arabinanases are the only enzymes hydrolysing (1 → 5) α-l-arabinofuranosyl bonds within the arabinan polysaccharide. At present, only one type of endo-arabinanase gene was characterized in different Aspergilli spp. (Flipphi et al. 1993; de Vries and Visser 2001; Skjot et al. 2001). Also, reports on exo-arabinanase from GH93 family are rare and they are found, e.g., in Penicillium chrysogenum (Sakamoto, 2004) and in Fusarium graminearum. The latter displayed a strict substrate specificity for linear α-1,5-l-arabinan and releases arabinobiose from the nonreducing end (Carapito et al. 2009).AXHs from GH62 family specifically cleave (1 → 2) or (1 → 3) α-l-arabinofuranoside residues only from xylans. GH62 family AXHs were characterized from A. niger and A. thubingiensis (Gielkens et al. 1997), while ABFs from the GH62 family were characterized in, e.g., A. sojae. Whether there is a real difference within GH62 between AXH and these ABFs needs further clarification as for the A. sojae GH62 enzyme, which shows a high sequence identity to the AXHs of A. niger and A. thubingiensis, the substrate specifity was observed to be different as the enzyme acted not only on arabinoxylan, but also on arabinan and arabinogalactan (Kimura et al. 2000).β-xylosidases with ABF activity are found in GH3 family. Studies in A. niger and T. reesei showed that xlnD/bxl1 encodes for the major extracellular β-xylosidase responsible for the liberation of d-xylose from d-xylose polymers. Experiments indicate that the β-xylosidase has a further ABF activity, which could only be observed with synthetic p-nitrophenyl-α-arabinofuranoside as substrate but not with, e.g., arabinoxylan (Herrmann et al. 1997, van Peji et al. 1997, Margolles-Clark et al. 1996).Although arabinan degrading enzymes are present in most fungi, a number of fungi seem to miss endo-arabinanases (e.g., T. reesei, Akel et al. 2009), which explains the reduced growth on arabinan polysaccharide and might limit their ability to attack intact plant cell walls.For the microbial degradation of l-arabinose, a number of different pathways were described. The best studied prokaryotic pathway includes an isomerase step (Schleif 2000) where l-arabinose is converted to d-xylulose 5-phosphate by l-arabinose isomerase, l-ribulokinase, and l-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase. In addition, prokaryotic oxidative pathways were described (Watanabe et al. 2006; Dahms and Anderson 1969), which result in either the TCA cycle metabolite α-ketoglutarate or pyruvate and glycolaldehyde. Fungi have a unique oxidoreductive pathway, which produces, in analogy to the bacterial isomerase pathway, d-xylulose 5-phosphate. The basic biochemistry of l-arabinose catabolism was established in P. chrysogenum (Chiang and Knight 1961) and latter in A. niger (Witteveen et al. 1989). The pathway is characterized by four alternating reduction–oxidation reactions (Fig. 2), which convert l-arabinose via l-arabinitol (NADPH), l-xylulose (NAD+) and xylitol (NADPH) to d-xylulose (NAD+ dependent). In a final irreversible step, d-xylulose is phosphorylated to d-xylulose 5-phosphate, a substrate of the pentose phosphate pathway. These steps are catalyzed in the following order by l-arabinose reductase, l-arabinitol dehydrogenase, l-xylulose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase, and xylulokinase. Although this process is overall redox neutral, it results in an imbalance of the redox cofactors since reductases use NADPH while dehydrogenases NAD+ as cofactor. Within the last years, the corresponding genes and proteins were characterized, which provides now an (almost) complete picture of this fungal-specific route. The other abundant pentose d-xylose is catabolized in a similar way, and both pathways are interconnected with xylitol as the first common metabolite of the shared part (Fig. 2). Genes, encoding the enzymes for these pathway, are present in most fungal genomes, in some cases, an amplification of some of the pathway genes has taken place, leading to a number of paralogous genes (Flipphi et al. 2009). The analysis of the pathway is further complicated by the presence of two or even more enzymes with similar substrate specificities, which can compensate for the loss of a specific pathway gene to varying degrees. Although these enzymes are not directly involved in l-arabinose catabolism but, e.g., in d-xylose catabolism, they are present during normal growth on l-arabinose or specifically expressed in the absence of one of the l-arabinose pathway enzymes.

The nature of the enzyme(s) catalyzing the first NADPH-dependent reduction of l-arabinose differs depending on the organism. This step is catalyzed by members of the aldo-keto reductase family, and deletion analysis of T. reesei and A. niger suggests that at least two enzymes are involved in this step. In T. reesei, the main reductase is the d-xylose reductase (XYL1), which accounts for most of the reductase activity on both l-arabinose and d-xylose. Deletion of the T. reesei xyl1 results in significantly impaired growth on both sugars (Akel et al. 2009; Seiboth et al. 2007). In A. niger, the situation is different: a reductase with preferred specificity for l-arabinose has been described (de Groot et al. 2005), and recently, the corresponding gene larA was cloned (Mojzita et al. 2010a). LarA is induced by l-arabinose, and the recombinant-produced enzyme converts l-arabinose and also d-xylose to their corresponding sugar polyols with a higher affinity for l-arabinose. Growth on l-arabinose as carbon source and l-arabinose reductase activity are decreased by a larA gene knockout. A candidate for the remaining l-arabinose reductase activity is the d-xylose reductase XyrA, an orthologue of the T. reesei XYL1, which shows overlapping substrate specificity with the l-arabinose reductase (de Groot et al. 2005).An l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase was first cloned in T. reesei (Richard et al. 2001). Deletion of lad1 leads to a loss of growth on l-arabinose and l-arabinitol and the effect is, therefore, similar to the araA1 mutation in A. nidulans (de Vries et al. 1994; Pail et al. 2004). Genetic evidence further showed that the T. reesei LAD1 can partially compensate for the loss of the xylitol dehydrogenase step in an xdh1-negative strain during growth on d-xylose and xylitol (Seiboth et al. 2003).The cloning of the fungal l-xylulose reductase (LXR) proved to be difficult, and still, more research efforts are needed to fully comprehend this step. The first gene encoding a fungal enzyme with l-xylulose reductase activity was identified by a genetic screening of genes, which enabled growth on l-arabinose of a S. cerevisiae strain that expressed all genes necessary for l-arabinose catabolism with the exception of LXR (Richard et al. 2002). However, deletion of lxr1 in T. reesei did not affect growth on l-arabinose/l-arabinitol or the l-xylulose reductase activity in cell extracts of l-arabinose grown T. reesei. Based on aa sequence similarities and a reduction of d-mannitol dehydrogenase activity in a lxr1 deletion strain, we concluded that the encoded protein is actually a d-mannitol dehydrogenase involved in developmental processes (Metz et al. 2009). Attempts to clone the ‘true’ NADPH-dependent l-xylulose reductase resulted in the l-arabinose inducible A. niger lxrA. The A. niger LxrA shows a much higher specific activity (450 U/mg compared to 4.8 U/mg) than the T. reesei LXR1 and is more specific for l-xylulose than LXR1, which shows also activity against some other ketose sugars, including d-xylulose, d-fructose, and l-sorbose (Richard et al. 2002). LxrA deletion results in strains lacking almost all NADPH-specific l-xylulose reductase activity. Surprisingly, only a slight reduction of growth on l-arabinose was observed. A useful hint towards the further fate of l-xylulose seems to be that NADH-dependent activities are present in the deletion strain, which were even slightly increased (Mojzita et al. 2010b). In A. niger, both l-xylulose reductase activities had been described before and are induced by l-arabinose and to a lesser extent also by d-xylose (Witteveen et al. 1989). A candidate for such an activity could be orthologues of the NADH-dependent l-xylulose reductase Alx1 of the yeast Ambrosiozyma monospora (Verho et al. 2004), but their relevance for the fungal l-xylulose step still needs to be established. Interestingly, we have identified now a further NADPH-dependent l-xylulose reductase in T. reesei, which belongs, like the other two, to the group of short-chain dehydrogenase (Kallberg et al. 2002). This gene is not directly phylogenetically related to A. niger LxrA, but its deletion results in reduced growth on l-arabinose and l-arabinitol (our unpublished data).A xylitol dehydrogenase was first characterized in T. reesei, and it represents the first common enzyme of the shared pathway between l-arabinose and d-xylose catabolism. It is, therefore, both d-xylose and l-arabinose inducible, and its deletion leads to a reduced growth rate on d-xylose, whereas growth rates on xylitol remained almost unaltered due to the expression of lad1 in a Δxdh1 strain (Seiboth et al. 2003). The effect on growth rate differs also for l-arabinose and l-arabinitol. On l-arabinose, growth of the Δxdh1 strain is not seriously affected, while strongly reduced on l-arabinitol. One of the reasons may be the general lower growth rate of T. reesei on l-arabinose compared to l-arabinitol (Akel et al. 2009) and that its loss might be, therefore, better be compensated for by LAD1. Deletion of both lad1 and xdh1 leads to the inability of T. reesei to grow on l-arabinose or d-xylose and its corresponding polyols at all.Phosphorylation of d-xylulose is catalyzed by a single enzyme as described for A. niger. The xylulokinase is essential for l-arabinose and d-xylose catabolism, and the encoding gene A. niger xkiA was cloned by complementation of a xylulokinase mutant due to its ability to regain growth on d-xylose (vanKuyk et al. 2001).Beside the classical pathway, where d-xylulose 5-phosphate is further assimilated in the pentose phosphate pathway, analysis of the genomes of several fungi revealed that some contain a putative phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.2.9) gene. This would raise the (theoretical) possibility for a shortcut catabolism of d-xylulose-5-phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and acetylphosphate, bypassing the pentose phosphate pathway (Flipphi et al. 2009), although respective enzyme activities could not be detected in A. niger cell-free extracts (Witteveen et al. 1989).Expression of the extra- and intracellular enzymes is specifically and coordinately induced in response to the presence of l-arabinose or the downstream pathway intermediate l-arabinitol. Expression is usually repressed during growth on more readily utilizable monosaccharides, such as d-glucose even in the simultaneous presence of l-arabinose, which can result from inducer exclusion or carbon catabolite repression. Since the accumulation of intracellular l-arabinitol correlates with higher production of the enzymes involved in arabinan breakdown in A. nidulans and A. niger, l-arabinitol is often regarded as the true inducer of the arabinanolytic system (de Vries 2003). Regulatory A. niger mutants of the l-arabinose pathway were described by (De Groot et al. 2003) and showed a decrease in both arabinanases and intracellular pathway gene expression in the presence of l-arabinose and l-arabinitol, but the genes corresponding to these loci have not been cloned yet. The Zn(II)2-Cys6 binuclear cluster protein XlnR is a transcriptional activator of cellulase and xylanase gene transcription in different Aspergillus spp. and an orthologue, thereof, was also described for T. reesei (for a review see (Stricker et al. 2008)). However, XlnR has been reported not to regulate arabinan and l-arabinose metabolism in Aspergilli (de Groot et al. 2003). Recently the specific l-arabinose regulator AraR was identified, which controls the l-arabinose pathway and the extracellular degrading arabinanases (Battaglia et al. 2010). It also interacts with XlnR in the regulation of specific steps of the pentose catabolic pathway. Therefore, two positive regulators are involved in the pentose catabolic pathway of l-arabinose and d-xylose in A. niger, which respond to either d-xylose (XlnR) or l-arabinose/l-arabinitol (AraR), or both. AraR is able to compensate for loss of XlnR on d-xylose, whereas XlnR is hardly able to compensate for loss of AraR on l-arabinose. AraR seems to be the result of a gene duplication, which occurred specifically in the Eurotiales and is, therefore, not present in T. reesei. In analogy to A. niger, it was reported that in T. reesei, a knockout of the xlnR orthologue xyr1 did not affect growth of the fungus on l-arabinose and the total l-arabinose reductase activity (Stricker et al. 2006). However, a xyl1 gene knockout resulted in a strongly impaired growth on l-arabinose due to the major involvement of XYL1 in the total l-arabinose reductase activity (Seiboth et al. 2007), and despite earlier claims, we found that the deletion of XYR1 leads to a decreased growth on l-arabinose. XYR1 regulates, however, only the first step of l-arabinose catabolism, since Δxyr1 strains constitutively, expressing XYL1 can regain wild-type growth, and the growth rate of a Δxyr1 strain on l-arabinitol is similar to the parental strain. Therefore, a specific transcriptional activator of the genes involved in the regulation of the catabolic pathway genes downstream of xyl1 in T. reesei and a regulator outside the Eurotiales for l-arabinose catabolism is still not known.In T. reesei, all four ABF-encoding genes (i.e., abf1-3; and bxl1) are l-arabinose and l-arabinitol inducible. Analysis of the influence of the early catabolic steps on expression of the ABF genes showed that loss of lad1 leads (similar to A. niger) to a strongly enhanced expression of all four ABF-encoding genes, whereas their expression was severely impaired in an Δxyl1 strain. This impairment was also found on l-arabinitol, although XYL1 is not needed for growth on l-arabinitol. Deletion of the (hemi) cellulase regulator xyr1 led to a loss of expression of two ABF-encoding genes (abf2 and bxl1), whereas the expression of abf1 and 3 was only slightly affected. The upregulation of the abf1-3 and bxl1 in the ∆lad1 strain would be consistent with the hypothesis that l-arabinitol, which accumulates in the ∆lad1 strain, is the intracellular inducer. However, a possible role of l-arabinose as inducer cannot be excluded, since l-arabinose can be formed by the reverse reaction of XYL1 during growth on l-arabinitol. Respective l-arabinose levels were decreased in the Δxyl1 strain but elevated in the Δlad1 strain. In conclusion, the expression of the arabinanolytic genes in T. reesei seems to be regulated by an early pathway intermediate (l-arabinose or l-arabinitol), the first enzyme of the pathway XYL1, and in the case of abf2 and bxl1 the (hemi) cellulase regulator XYR1.An interesting finding is that in A. niger, a number of l-arabinose pathway genes (e.g., ladA, larA) are initially upregulated after transfer to d-xylose (Mojzita et al. 2010b). This finding might be an artifact, since d-xylose can contain small amounts of l-arabinose (Andersen et al. 2008). Considering that both d-xylose and l-arabinose are often concomitantly present in the plant cell wall polymers, such a coinduction could make sense for a saprobic fungus to effectively release and assimilate both pentoses. In this context, it is interesting that an overexpression of the Aspergillus oryzae xlnR led to an upregulation of genes involved in l-arabinose metabolism, including ladA and the lxrA orthologue (Noguchi et al. 2009).In eukaryotes, the hexose d-galactose is usually assimilated via the Leloir pathway (for a recent review: Sellick et al. 2008). The galactokinase of the Leloir pathway is specific for α-d-galactose, and therefore, β-d-galactose has to be epimerized to its α-anomer by a mutarotase (aldose 1-epimerase, EC 5.1.3.3) before it can be phosphorylated. Fungi, such as A. nidulans and T. reesei, have at least a second possibility at hand to utilize d-galactose, which was discovered by blocking of the Leloir pathway (Seiboth et al. 2004; Roberts 1970). In A. nidulans, this pathway was only active at pH > 7, and Roberts speculated that the pathway might start with an oxidative step by a d-galactose oxidase. Later it was shown that this pH-dependent growth was found only in the presence of ammonium but not nitrate as nitrogen source (Fekete et al. 2004). A nonphosphorolytic pathway has been suggested to be operative in, e.g., A. niger (Elshafei and Abdel-Fatah 2001), but its importance for d-galactose will need further investigations.In T. reesei, the first identified pathway intermediate of this second d-galactose pathway was galactitol, which was discovered due to its transient accumulation during growth on d-galactose or lactose in a galactokinase deletion strain (Seiboth et al. 2004). In T. reesei, the catabolic path is initiated by the d-xylose reductase XYL1 (EC 1.1.1.21, Seiboth et al. 2007), which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of d-galactose (beside d-xylose and l-arabinose) to galactitol. Using our collection of specific gene deletion strains in the l-arabinose and d-xylose pathway and testing these for their growth on the first pathway intermediate galactitol, further steps of the pathway could be identified (Fig. 3). The second step in this pathway, i.e., the NAD+ dependent oxidation of galactitol is catalyzed by the T. reesei
l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase LAD1. Δlad1 strains are unable to grow on galactitol, and a simultaneous block of the Leloir pathway at the galactosekinase step (Δlad1Δgal1) led to the inability to grow on d-galactose. Characterization of the recombinant produced LAD1 led to the unexpected finding that galactitol is oxidized to l-xylo-3-hexulose (Pail et al. 2004). This intermediate has not yet been identified in other fungi, and the further fate of this metabolite is currently under investigation. In analogy to the l-arabinose pathway, we hypothesize that an l-xylulose reductase might be responsible for its further catabolism. However, knockout strains in the T. reesei lxr1 or a double deletion strain (Δgal1Δlxr1) grew indistinguishable from the parental strains QM9414 or the single deletion strain Δgal1 on d-galactose and galactitol (unpublished results). An obvious explanation for this finding is that LXR1—as described above—turned out to be also not involved in l-arabinose catabolism. Therefore, further research will concentrate on the T. reesei orthologue of the true l-xylulose reductase LxrA of A. niger in the catabolism of l-xylo-3-hexulose. In A. nidulans, l-sorbose was found to accumulate during growth on d-galactose but was absent in strains with a loss-of-activity of l-arabinitol dehydrogenase (araA1), which suggests that l-sorbose is an intermediate of this d-galactose pathway in A. nidulans (Fekete et al. 2004). Further l-sorbose catabolism involved a hexokinase step, indicated by the inability of the A. nidulans frA1 (fructose non-phosphorylating) mutant to grow on galactitol or l-sorbose and that an additional mutation in the galactokinase led to strains unable to grow on d-galactose. The role of hexokinase would imply that the metabolism of l-sorbose proceeds by reduction to d-sorbitol and subsequent oxidation to d-fructose. The l-sorbose step requires a reductase activity, which in analogy to the l-arabinose pathway, could be fulfilled by an l-xylulose reductase or similar enzyme.

A second oxidoreductive pathway of d-galactose utilization. A second pathway for d-galactose uilization was recently identified in T. reesei and A. nidulans. It starts with the reduction of d-galactose to galactitol by the d-xylose reductase XYL1 (aldose reductase) in T. reesei. A hypothetical draft of the pathway for the further degradation of galactitol is summarizedFrom our data, it is however, not clear if the product of LAD1 l-xylo-3-hexulose has to be further converted to l-sorbose before it can be reduced to d-sorbitol. Further efforts will be necessary to elucidate this part of the pathway and to establish if there might be differences between A. nidulans and T. reesei. In T. reesei, d-sorbitol oxidation to d-fructose can be carried out by the T. reesei XDH1 (and partially also by LAD1), and in analogy to the pentose catabolic pathways, this d-galactose pathway ends with a phosphorylation of d-fructose to d-fructose 6-phosphate, which is consistent with our results obtained with a hexokinase deletion strain of T. reesei, which is unable to grow on galactitol and d-sorbitol (Guangtao et al. 2010, our unpublished results).The physiological relevance of this pathway for d-galactose utilization seems to differ between A. nidulans and T. reesei. In A. nidulans, the pathway can fully compensate for the loss of the Leloir pathway (Roberts 1970; Fekete et al. 2004), while in T. reesei, inactivation of the Leloir pathway leads already to strains, which are significantly impaired in their growth on d-galactose. However, in T. reesei, this pathway is of importance for galactitol and lactose utilization and cellulase induction (Kubicek et al. 2009).Within the last years, our understanding of the arabinanases and l-arabinose catabolism has substantially increased, but a number of open questions remain in context with l-arabinose uptake and the regulation of the arabinanolytic system outside of the Eurotiales. Further research will also be necessary to understand the l-xylulose reductase step in fungi and its implication for the redox factor balance of this pathway."
PMC3047435,Thermostability in endoglucanases is fold-specific,False,"Endoglucanases are usually considered to be synergistically involved in the initial stages of cellulose breakdown-an essential step in the bioprocessing of lignocellulosic plant materials into bioethanol. Despite their economic importance, we currently lack a basic understanding of how some endoglucanases can sustain their ability to function at elevated temperatures required for bioprocessing, while others cannot. In this study, we present a detailed comparative analysis of both thermophilic and mesophilic endoglucanases in order to gain insights into origins of thermostability. We analyzed the sequences and structures for sets of endoglucanase proteins drawn from the Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy) database.Our results demonstrate that thermophilic endoglucanases and their mesophilic counterparts differ significantly in their amino acid compositions. Strikingly, these compositional differences are specific to protein folds and enzyme families, and lead to differences in intramolecular interactions in a fold-dependent fashion.Here, we provide fold-specific guidelines to control thermostability in endoglucanases that will aid in making production of biofuels from plant biomass more efficient.Understanding the molecular basis of thermostability is essential for protein engineering applications where the thermal stability of a protein could potentially be enhanced. An important industrial application is to genetically engineer plants for increased biofuel production. For example, a thermostable endoglucanase from Acidothermus cellulolyticus has been expressed in Zea mays subsp. mays increasing the hydrolysis efficiency for conversion of plant cellulose to ethanol [1]. Using this transgenic modification allows hydrolysis of cellulose fibers to begin a pre-processing step within the plant. Transgenic corn feedstock expressing thermostable endoglucanases is an innovation that simplifies the hydrolysis of cellulose-derived ethanol, and hence lowers the cost of production. Although the details of the exact mechanism through which cellulases act is far from complete, it is usually considered that endoglucanase generates cellulose chain ends, following an attack by cellobiohydrolase for subsequent hydrolysis [2-4].Although thermophilic enzymes are industrially important, our understanding of the factors responsible for thermostability in these enzymes is still incomplete. Many studies have addressed this question by comparing homologous protein structures from different families as an aggregate set [5-11] or by focusing on differences for a single family [12-14]. These comparative studies typically analyze several factors such as the energy of unfolding, number of VdW contacts per residue, number of hydrogen bonds per residue, or number of residues involved in secondary structure at the protein level [5]. Often, these studies have sought to identify any detectable relationship between amino acid composition and thermostability. One of the earlier comparative studies with 18 different families of proteins observed that Arg and Tyr are significantly higher in thermophiles, while Cys and Ser are significantly lower in thermophilic proteins [7]. In a study by Sarai's group, the following factors were argued to impart thermostability: Gibbs free energy change of hydration, long-range non-bonded energy, β-strand tendency and average long-range contacts [11]. However, rather than identifying the structural or sequence-based rules governing increased thermostability these comparisons have instead only suggested many physical or structural features that may impart thermostability, including preferences of certain amino acids [7], increased hydrophobicity [8], or even a single amino acid mutation [14]. By extending the comparison to many different pairs of proteins from two organisms (one thermophilic and one mesophilic) factors such as increase in compactness and sequence dependent strong interactions have been identified as two physical mechanisms underlying thermostability [5].Previously reported studies [5,10,15,16] involving comparison of thermophilic and mesophilic organism's proteome have led to the conclusion that positively charged residues play an important role in imparting thermophilicity. Berezovsky and Shakhnovich [5] concluded that the strategy of organism's adaptation in a thermophilic environment depends on the ""evolutionary history"" and ""sequence-based"" mechanism.In another approach to the proteome level study, the entire proteome of specific organisms were homology modelled from the PDB database and both sequential and structural comparisons were made between thermophiles and mesophiles. Berezovsky et al [15] used two independently different datasets (the Mintz dataset consisting of 2907 protein structures and the Bordner dataset consisting of 435 protein structures). These authors considered a temperature cutoff of 50°C for classifying thermophiles or mesophiles and concluded that positively charged amino acids play a crucial role in thermophilic proteins by stabilizing the interface and overall protein structures. Chakravarty and Varadarajan [16] used 21 mesophilic (900 protein structures) and 9 thermophilic (300 protein structures) organisms as the dataset and a temperature cutoff of 37°C to differentiate thermophiles from mesophiles. Their results showed that Val and Glu are significantly higher in thermophiles and are also solvent exposed. At the same time, Gln, Asn, Ser, Thr, and His are significantly lower in thermophiles. Comparison of intramolecular interactions showed that cation-π interactions are highly significant in imparting thermophilicity. Similarly, Glyakina et al [10] showed that positively charged residues (Lys, Arg and Glu) on the solvent accessible surface are more significant in thermophiles than in mesophiles.Because the features that cause thermostability for one protein family are not significant for other families of thermophilic proteins, many studies have focused on thermostabilizing features within a single protein family [12,14,17,18]. In the case of the (α/β)8 fold in glycosyl hydrolases (GHs), for example, it was reported that a reduction in the number of Gly residues in thermophilic proteins led to greater stability at higher temperatures [12]. However, this study had two shortcomings: the criteria to select a data set of 29 proteins was solely based on higher crystallographic resolution, but not on lower sequence identities, which can bias the results substantially. And among the 29 structures used, there were only three endoglucanase structures (E.C 3.2.1.4) in the thermophilic set whereas none from the same enzyme class in the mesophilic set. Therefore, the study analyzed the lack of Gly preference in thermophilic glycosyl hydrolase enzymes, rather than endoglucanases specifically. In contrast, here we focus specifically on endoglucanases (E.C. 3.2.1.4) that share no more than 70% sequence identity.From structural comparisons of proteins from a single fold, Sandgren et al experimentally found that a single amino acid mutation of alanine to valine was responsible for thermal stability among the GH12 family of endoglucanases [14]. Although cases where a single residue change imparts increased stability are quite rare, similar examples can be found in a cold shock protein where two residues confer thermostability [19].The overall inability to identify common trends for thermostability among many different protein families has caused some to speculate that no single rule defines protein thermostability and the factors determining thermostability for one fold or family of proteins may never be universally applicable [12]. More likely, these comparisons between homologous proteins are complicated by the underlying, unknown relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function. For example, several studies implicated intrinsic disorder as a factor in thermostability at low temperatures, where an increase in temperature induces partial, reversible folding of the protein [20,21]. With the recent hypothesis that psychrophilic (cold-loving) proteins are intrinsically disordered [22], this complex relationship is far from resolved. Another issue to consider is the evolution of folds. The emergence of folds within an enzyme family is likely due to convergent evolution of the different protein structures adapting to the same substrate (cellulose for endoglucanases) at different evolutionary periods. Convergent evolution of distinct folds adapting to perform the same function and mechanism is well documented in pathogenic virulence factors [23], lectins [24], toxins [25], receptors [26], and kinases [27]. Hence, the question of the fold effect on thermostability for a protein enzyme family addresses whether convergent evolution for that family adopted different or similar factors to impart thermostability.Here we investigate how the evolution-driven mechanisms imparting thermostability may vary for different folds. We look at the sequence- and structure-based factors that can contribute to thermostability for the family of endoglucanase proteins across and within three distinct folds, namely the (α/β)8 fold, β-jelly roll fold and the (α/α)6 fold. We specifically concentrate on 1,4-β-D-glucanases or endoglucanases, which belong to the broader family of enzymes known as glycosyl hydrolases, extracted from bacterial and fungal sources. Glycosyl hydrolases are enzymes that hydrolyze complex carbohydrate moieties and are comprised of cellulase, xylanase, pectinases, β-glucanase, exocellulase, mananase etc [28]. They are widely used in a wide range of industrial applications, such as juice and wine industries for clarification of beverages; feed industries for increasing the digestibility of the feed; paper and pulp industries for pulp bleaching process; textile industries for selective modification of cellulose fibers (depilling); and in reproducing the stonewashing effect on jeans [29].In the last few years, cellulases have been used in the conversion of biomass to fermentable sugars for ethanol production. Currently they are extracted from microbial sources leading to increased production costs [30]. Considerable efforts are being undertaken towards improved yield and reduced costs of bioethanol production [31]. Even though they share the same structural fold and catalytic mechanism, our knowledge is limited as to why certain endoglucanases are thermophilic. Understanding this limitation is crucial for enhanced utilization of thermophilic endoglucanases for conversion of biomass to bioethanol. Although both protein folds and protein functions play a role in contributing to thermostability, our hypothesis is that protein folds rather than protein families dominate in determining which specific factors are responsible for protein thermostability.Endoglucanases (E.C 3.2.1.4) have three distinct structure folds: the (α/β)8 fold, β-jelly roll fold and the (α/α)6 fold (Figure ​(Figure11).Different folds in endoglucanases with the catalytic residues highlighted in inset. (A) (α/β)8 fold (Acidothermus cellulolyticus pdb id: 1ece) (B) β-jelly roll fold (Streptomyces lividans pdb id: 2nlr), and (C) (α/α)6 fold (Clostridium thermocellum F7 pdb id: 1l1y) are shown in cartoon representation with helices colored in red, sheets colored in yellow, and loops in green. (D) Two-step retaining mechanism of endoglucanase catalysis in (α/β)8 and β-jelly roll folds, where the configuration of the anomeric carbon is retained after hydrolysis and a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is formed. (E) Single-step inverting mechanism of endoglucanase catalysis in (α/α)6 fold, where the configuration of the anomeric carbon is inverted; i.e hydrolysis of β-glycosidic bond leads to α-configuration of carbon and vice versa. In (α/β)8 and β-jelly roll fold, two glutamic acid residues act as the nucleophile and acid/base donor (shown in Inset (A) and Inset (B)). In (α/α)6 fold, a water molecule acts as the nucleophile, and glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues act as the acid/base donor (Inset (C)). The individual residues in stick representation are the nucleophile (in orange) and acid/base donor (in blue).This fold has an alternating pattern of eight α and β subunits in a single domain, such that the eight parallel β strands on the inside are protected by eight α helices on the outside (Figure ​(Figure1A).1A). Often referred to as a TIM barrel because it was first discovered in the triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) enzyme, this extremely common fold has been reported to display the highest diversity of enzymatic functions [32]. Endoglucanases in glycosyl hydrolases families 5 (GH 5) and 44 (GH 44) share this fold.This fold consists of 15 β-strands in two twisted anti-parallel β-sheets, named A and B, that pack against each another (Figure ​(Figure1B).1B). β-sheet A contains six anti-parallel β-strands forming the back, convex surface while β-sheet B contains nine anti-parallel β-strands arranged to form the front, concave binding surface [29]. Additionally two α-helices pack against the back side of β-sheet B.The substrate binding cleft in this fold has a tunnel shape formed at the N-termini of six central, parallel α-helices (Figure ​(Figure1C).1C). These six helices are surrounded by six external α-helices. Unlike the (α/β)8 and β-jelly roll folds, the (α/α)6 fold utilizes the inverting mechanism for hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds (see below) [33].Cellulose is a linear homo-polysaccharide made up of glucose units that are linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. There are two ends of the polymer: a reducing end, where the terminating anomeric carbon is not linked to another glucose unit, and a non-reducing end. Upon synthesis, cellulose forms as microfibrils that are strengthened by hydrogen, hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions, making it more resistant to hydrolysis than starch, which is made up of α-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Two main different catalytic mechanisms are employed by the glycosyl hydrolases for hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds: the retaining and the inverting mechanisms [29].In this mechanism (Figure ​(Figure1D),1D), the stereometric configuration of the anomeric carbon is retained in the β-configuration after hydrolysis. A pair of Glu amino acids, separated by 5.5 Å, act as the catalytic residues: one as a nucleophile and the other an acid-base donor. The first step in this double displacement mechanism is glycosylation, where one of the catalytic residue's carboxylic group induces acid-catalyzed leaving group departure simultaneous to a nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon to form a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate by the second catalytic residue's carboxylic group. In the second step, a water molecule acts as a nucleophile and the first residue's carboxylic group acts as a base. Once deprotonated, the water molecule is an activated nucleophile that then hydrolyzes the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate leading to a break in the polymer. The (α/β)8 (GH5 and GH44 families) and β-jelly roll (GH7 and GH12 families) folds use the retaining mechanism.In this mechanism (Figure ​(Figure1E),1E), the configuration of the anomeric carbon is inverted; i.e., hydrolysis of β-glycosidic bond leads to α-configuration of carbon and vice versa. The details of this enzymatic mechanism are still not completely known. Glu-Glu pairs usually act as acid-based donors, but recent studies also suggest that Asp may act as the base donor in inverting cellulases [34,35]. Alzari's work [35] suggests specifically Asp as the probable catalytic base in the family GH8. Therefore a pair of Glu-Glu or in some cases Glu-Asp amino acid pairs, separated by 6.5Å to 9.5Å, may act as acid-base donors and a water molecule acts as a nucleophile. Utilizing the water molecule on the opposite side of the sugar ring to stabilize the transition, these residues catalyze the glycosylation or deglycosylation in one step. Unlike the retaining mechanism, this mechanism does not involve the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. The (α/α)6 fold (GH8, GH48 and GH9 families) uses the inverting mechanism for cellulose hydrolysis.It has long been suggested that in order to function at higher temperatures, thermophilic proteins contain amino acids that contribute to stronger interactions, which stabilize the structure as compared to mesophiles. Such amino acids form salt-bridges [36], disulfide bonds [37] or cause greater core hydrophobicity [8]. In order to investigate whether this holds true for endoglucanases, we examined the statistical significance of different amino acid compositions and various intramolecular features between mesophilic and thermophilic proteins.In order to identify the different roles that catalytic mechanism or overall structural fold might play in contributing to these differences, we performed the comparison between thermophilic and mesophilic proteins for each of the following datasets: (A) the dataset comprising all endoglucanases as a enzyme group; (B) two datasets representing each of the two catalytic mechanisms; and (C) three datasets representing the three distinct folds separately. In each of the datasets, the proteins were categorized as thermophilic or mesophilic. Table ​Table11 lists the thermophilic and mesophilic endoglucanases in the three distinct folds.Protein sets of Thermophilic and Mesophilic endoglucanasesA subset of proteins with less than or equal to 70% sequence identity was created as described in the Methods section. A protein is considered thermophilic if the source organism's optimum growth temperature is above 40°C. GH stands for glycosyl hydrolase.As described in the Methods section (see below), to identify the significant amino acids (Figure ​(Figure22 and Figure ​Figure3)3) that make a contribution towards stabilizing the protein structure, intramolecular interactions were calculated. After normalizing with respect the protein length, t-test was performed to identify statistical significance (Figure ​(Figure3;3; please see Additional file 1 for detailed quantitative results).Normalized amino acid count per protein. The number of amino acids was normalized with respect to protein length. Amino acid composition of (A) endoglucanases enzyme group, (B) endoglucanase retaining catalytic mechanism, (C) (α/β)8 fold, (D) β-jelly roll fold, and (E) (α/α)6 fold. The mean of each amino acid and its standard error are shown in each plot, grouped as reported in [5] into charged (DEKR), hydrophobic (ACFILMPVWY), and hydrophilic (HNQST) residues. Solid lines represent thermophilic protein set (squares show means) and dotted lines represent mesophilic protein set (diamonds show means). The statistically significant amino acids are shown in Figure 3. Note that the results for the (α/α)6 fold and the endoglucanase inverting mechanism are the same.Statistically significant amino acids and intramolecular interactions between thermophilic and mesophilic endoglucanases. They are shown in thermophilic endoglucanases as an enzyme group, based on the reaction mechanism, and within each fold, as compared to their mesophilic counterparts (p-value < 5.0 × 10-2). The statistically significant intramolecular interactions for thermophiles are shaded dark gray. Note that the results for inverting mechanism and on (α/α)6 fold are the same.In the larger dataset representing the entire endoglucanase enzyme group, we observed that amino acids Arg and Met are statistically significant among thermophiles, whereas Gln and Ser are statistically significant among mesophiles (Figure ​(Figure2A2A and Figure ​Figure3).3). It was previously reported that thermophilic glycosyl hydrolases are significantly missing Gly residues compared to their mesophilic counterparts [8], but we did not observe this negative preference in the case of endoglucanase thermophiles. This difference might be attributed to the fact that endoglucanases form only a small part of the glycosyl hydrolases data set used in the previous study.We also compared significant intramolecular interactions in thermophiles and mesophiles. For the thermophiles, only ionic interactions were significant, whereas for mesophiles, no intramolecular interactions were significantly different from thermophiles.We also analyzed the effect of catalytic mechanism on the amino acid distribution and intramolecular interactions. In the retaining mechanism ((α/β)8 and β-jelly roll folds) amino acids Leu, Met, Pro, and Arg were significant among thermophiles, whereas Ser and Val were significant among mesophiles (Figure ​(Figure2B2B and Figure ​Figure3).3). For the same mechanism, the MC-SC hydrogen bond interactions were significant among thermophiles. In the inverting mechanism ((α/α)6 fold) amino acids Glu, Val were significant among thermophiles, whereas only Gln was significant among mesophiles (Figure ​(Figure2E2E and Figure ​Figure3).3). However, none of the intramolecular interactions were significant. Strikingly, the significant amino acids and intramolecular interactions are different for the catalytic mechanisms than for endoglucanases as an enzyme group. Another interesting observation is that the significant amino acids and intramolecular interactions for the retaining mechanism are different than those of the individual folds that make up that mechanism. This result strengthens the idea that the analyses of folds provide more informative and detailed understanding of thermostability than a larger set made of many folds.It is noteworthy that overlaps of amino acid preferences exist if we compare different folds of the endoglucanases. For example, between (α/β)8 and β-jelly roll folds, Arg and Leu are significantly higher in thermophiles than in mesophiles (Figure ​(Figure2C2C and ​and2D).2D). Similarly, between β-jelly roll and (α/α)6 folds, Glu is significantly higher in thermophiles than in mesophiles (Figure ​(Figure2D2D and ​and2E).2E). Similarities in amino acid preferences within an enzyme class are usually assumed in many protein analyses. These class-specific similarities are actually the basis of those analyses that involve protein properties averaged over many enzyme classes and families. We show here that although similarities exist among the proteins forming an enzyme class, strong fold-specific differences are also present that need to be considered to understand the origin of thermostability.After identifying a subset of amino acids as statistically significant, we investigated if these amino acids displayed a preference for secondary structure state or solvent exposure.In the GH5 and GH44 families, Arg, Leu, and Pro were statistically more significant in thermophiles than in mesophiles, while none of the amino acids were statistically significant among mesophiles (Figure ​(Figure2C,2C, Figure ​Figure33 and Additional file 2). Pro is significantly absent in the β-sheets of the mesophiles whereas prominently present in the β-sheets in thermophiles (Figure ​(Figure4,4, Additional file 3 and Additional file 4). Similarly, Pro in thermophiles is significant in the intermediate class of relative surface accessibility (Figure ​(Figure44).The p-values for secondary structure and relative surface accessibility preferences for the statistically significant amino acids in thermophilic proteins among the three folds. The eight state classification of DSSP was reduced into three states (Helix, Sheet, and Loop) as described in the text. The amino acids are classified into three classes according to relative surface accessibility: buried, if less than 9%; intermediate, if between 9-36%; and exposed, if more than 36% [43]. The statistically significant secondary structure and solvent exposure preferences for amino acids are bolded and underlined and p-values are provided. Our analysis showed that the significant amino acids in mesophilic proteins do not show statistically significant preferences for secondary structure or solvent exposure.In GH7 and GH12 families, Glu, Arg, Cys, Leu, and His were statistically significant in thermophiles. The amino acids Ser and Thr were statistically significant in mesophiles (Figure ​(Figure2D,2D, Figure ​Figure33 and Additional file 2). Among the thermophiles Glu was significant in helices but absent in mesophiles (Figure ​(Figure4,4, Additional file 3 and Additional file 4). Also all the Cys are significant in the buried class. His is extremely significant in the intermediate class in thermophiles than in mesophiles (Figure ​(Figure4).4). Leu is highly significant in the exposed class for thermophiles, as no Leu is exposed in mesophiles.Similarly, in GH8, GH48, and GH9 families, Glu and Val were statistically significant in thermophiles and Gln is statistically significant in mesophiles (Figure ​(Figure2E,2E, Figure ​Figure33 and Additional file 2). Glu and Val were not located in secondary structure and surface accessibility classes in a statistically significant manner (Figure ​(Figure4,4, Additional file 3 and Additional file 4).Among the three folds of endoglucanases, it is interesting to note that the individual amino acid frequencies do not follow a similar pattern. Each fold has specific groups of amino acids that are significant, which cannot be universally applied to other folds, highlighting the importance that sequence plays in determining structure. But also, and more importantly, this result indicates that amino acids responsible for thermophilicity may not rely on enzyme family but more specifically on the protein fold.Multiple structural alignment of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins in each fold was performed to identify structurally and evolutionarily similar proteins. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the structure-based multiple sequence alignments of each fold (Figure ​(Figure5a,5a, ​,5b,5b, and ​and5c).5c). From these trees, the closest pair of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins for each fold was identified and selected for further analysis of possible thermostabilizing differences. Table ​Table22 lists these three pairs of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins: Clostridium thermocellum (pdb id: 2e4t) and Clostridium acetobutylicum (pdb id: 3ik2); Rhodotermus marinus (pdb id: 2bw8) and Streptomyces lividans (pdb id: 2nlr); and Clostridium thermocellum (pdb id: 1l1y) and Clostridium cellulolyticum (pdb id: 1g9g) from the (α/β)8, β-jelly roll, and (α/α)6 folds respectively.Phylogenetic tree created using the structure-based multiple sequence alignments in each fold. The thermophilic proteins are shown in boxes. The thermophilic-mesophilic protein pairs sharing a close evolutionary relationship that have been selected for further analysis are marked with black stars for each of the three folds: (A) (α/β)8, (B) β-jelly roll, and (C) (α/α)6. (D) A fragment of the pairwise alignment between the thermophilic (pdb id: 2e4t) and mesophilic (pdb id: 3ik2) (α/β)8 pair is shown to demonstrate the sequence differences for the statistically significant amino acid arginine in the thermophilic protein. Four arginine positions (shown in boxes) in the thermophilic protein are substituted by different amino acids in the mesophilic protein.Pairwise structural alignment of evolutionarily related thermophilic and mesophilic protein pairs for (α/β)8, β-jelly roll, and (α/α)6 foldsStructural superimposition for each of the three pairs shows the RMSD is below 1.5Å and Z-score above 7.2, indicating that the pairwise structural comparison is of a very good quality (Table ​(Table2).2). According to CE algorithm, a Z-score of above 3.5 indicates a very high statistical significance of structural alignment, which can also be seen by the very low number of gaps in each of the alignment (Table ​(Table22).Using pairwise structural alignments for each of these three sets, we were able to identify all the positions where the statistically significant amino acids differ and tally the nature of these substitutions. In particular, each substitution was counted as being polar, aromatic, hydrophobic, acidic, basic, proline, cysteine, or glycine. Figures ​Figures6,6, ​,7,7, ​,88 plot the results for each significant amino acid from each fold. Proline and glycine substitutions were separately counted because the presence of these two amino acids disrupts secondary structure by helix-breaking (Pro) and high flexibility (Gly). Likewise, Cys substitutions were counted separately because of their ability to form disulfide bonds.Mesophilic substitutions at the structurally equivalent positions of significant amino acid types in thermophiles for the (α/β)8 fold based on pairwise structural alignments. Statistically significant amino acid types are (A) arginine, (B) leucine, and (C) proline. Structurally equivalent positions of aligned amino acids between mesophilic endoglucanases and their structurally similar thermophilic counterpart were analyzed for substitutions. The x-axis shows the type or class of amino acids substituted in mesophiles. The count of substitution sites is plotted as a histogram for the following pair shown in Figure 3A: Clostridium thermocellum (Cα trace colored in red, pdb id: 2e4t) and mesophile Clostridium acetobutylicum (Cα trace colored in blue, pdb id: 3ik2). Positions of the amino acids are shown in CPK model in superimposed protein structures, where they are differentially colored with respect to atom type.Substitutions at the structurally equivalent positions of significant amino acid types in thermophiles for the β-jelly roll fold based on pairwise structural alignments. Statistically significant amino acid types are (A) glutamic acid, (B) arginine, (C) leucine, (D) histidine, (E) serine, and (F) threonine. Structurally equivalent positions of aligned amino acids between mesophilic endoglucanases and their structurally similar thermophilic counterpart were analyzed for substitutions. The x-axis shows the type or class of amino acids substituted in mesophiles ((a)-(d)) and in thermophiles ((e) and (f)). The count of substitution sites is plotted as a histogram for the following pair shown in Figure 3B: Rhodotermus marinus (Cα trace colored in red, pdb id: 2bw8) and mesophile Streptomyces lividans (Cα trace colored in blue, pdb id: 2nlr). Positions of the amino acids are shown in CPK model in superimposed protein structures, where they are differentially colored with respect to atom type.Substitutions at the structurally equivalent positions of significant amino acid types in thermophiles for the (α/α)6 fold based on pairwise structural alignments. Statistically significant amino acid types are (A) glutamic acid, (B) valine, and (C) glutamine. Structurally equivalent positions of aligned amino acids between mesophilic endoglucanases and their structurally similar thermophilic counterpart were analyzed for substitutions. The x-axis shows the type or class of amino acids substituted in mesophiles ((a) and (b)) and in thermophiles ((c)). The count of substitution sites is plotted as a histogram for the following pair shown in Figure 3C Clostridium thermocellum (Cα trace colored in red, pdb id: 1l1y) and mesophile Clostridium cellulolyticum (Cα trace colored in blue, pdb id: 1g9g). Positions of the amino acids are shown in CPK model in superimposed protein structures where they are differentially colored with respect to atom type.For the (α/β)8 fold (Figure ​(Figure6),6), Arg and Pro (significant in thermophiles) are overwhelmingly replaced by polar amino acids whereas Leu is primarily replaced with aromatic amino acids in the mesophilic counterpart. The replacement of arginines by non-basic polar amino acids in mesophiles supports the view that increased arginine content enhances thermostability. Conversely, the absence of these arginine amino acids leads to a loss of ionic interactions in mesophiles, rendering them enzymatically inactive at higher temperatures.In the β-jelly roll fold (Figure ​(Figure7),7), the amino acids Glu, Arg, and His are substituted with polar, hydrophobic amino acids. Substitution to Pro is higher for Arg indicating the potential for fewer salt-bridges in mesophiles. Quantitatively, we observe only 4 to 11 salt bridges in the mesophiles versus 16 to 40 salt bridges in the thermophiles for this fold. It is unclear as to how the mesophilic protein benefits from substitution of positively charged amino acids with negatively charged amino acids. It is however possible that because some thermophiles lived in acidic environments during their evolutionary history (as some still do), they might have a preference for positively charged amino acids that is carried over the generations that mesophiles do not have a need for. For the Ser and Thr positions (significant among mesophiles) the thermophilic protein has hydrophobic, acidic, and basic amino acids substituted. Interestingly, Thr is substituted with Gly in the thermophilic protein at some positions.In the (α/α)6 fold (Figure ​(Figure8),8), Glu and Val are replaced with polar amino acids and to a lesser extent with other amino acid groups. Gln (significant in mesophiles) is substituted to a large extent by hydrophobic, acidic and to a lesser extent with basic amino acid groups in thermophiles indicating that in the thermophilic protein these substitutions contribute towards more intramolecular interactions and extend stability to proteins at higher temperatures such as has been suggested previously as inducing better hydrophobic cores and packing [8].Comparing our results to the previously reported thermophilic-mesophilic comparative studies, we find that observations made for analysis across diverse families of proteins do not necessarily correspond with our family-specific analysis.For example, Chakravarty and Varadarajan had reported [16] that Val and Glu were significantly higher in thermophiles, which matches only to (α/α)6 fold. Also, we find that Glu is significant only in β-jelly roll fold and not in the (α/β)8 fold. At the same time, we observe that Gln, Ser, and Thr are significant in mesophiles which is in agreement to their results. However, when it comes to surface accessibility, we do not find any of the significant amino acids in thermophiles as exposed (Figure ​(Figure4)4) in the three folds, whereas Chakravarty and Varadarajan found that the significant amino acids in thermophiles are significantly exposed to the surface.Kumar et al performed a detailed statistical analysis for non-redundant dataset of 18 families [7]. A pair of thermophilic and mesophilic with high structural similarity from each family was selected. Among the amino acids, Arg and Tyr were found to be significantly higher in thermophiles. Among the intramolecular interactions, salt bridges, SC-SC hydrogen bonds were significantly higher in thermophiles.Comparing our results to Berezovsky et al [15] we also find positively charged amino acids significantly higher in thermophiles, specifically Arg and His. However, we did not find another positively charged amino acid, Lys, significant in thermophiles. Also, since our study involved single-domain proteins we did not calculate as to how the protein interface is stabilized in thermophilic proteins.Our results also agree with Berezovsky and Shakhnovich's [5] observation about sequence dependent strong interactions for thermostability. However, we see that only the β-jelly roll fold has (MC-MC, Ionic, and Cation-π) significant interactions in thermophiles.Understanding the processes responsible for thermostability in endoglucanases is complicated by the large range of structural and sequence diversity these enzymes adopt. Previous studies to derive trends explaining thermostability have focused on large number of protein families, but not necessarily on distinct folds of the same enzyme. In this study we have analyzed the known endoglucanase structures from the PDB and have shown that protein folds rather than protein families are more important when defining rules for thermophilicity. Previous studies [5,7] used the presence or absence of certain types of amino acids in secondary structures (helix, sheet, and loop) as an indication of their role in thermostability. We observed a similar pattern for endoglucanases, as shown in Figure ​Figure3,3, but the types of amino acids contributing to thermostability for the three specific folds studied here differ from those obtained using a more diverse set of proteins. Comparisons between evolutionarily close pairs of thermophilic and mesophilic endoglucanases in each of the fold, reinforces previous assertions that charged amino acids (Arg, His, and Glu) are important for stabilizing the protein at higher temperatures. But one should note that the solvent accessibility of these amino acids also plays a role.When it comes to thermostability, there is a caveat of applying general heuristic rules based on averaged properties to specific proteins: although thermostability in endoglucanases is usually conferred through altering amino acid composition, in some cases even a single-point mutation is sufficient to convert a mesophilic protein into a thermophilic protein [14].Upon analyzing the amino acid compositions and intramolecular interactions for the three folds adopted by endoglucanases a paradoxical picture emerges. Namely, although some amino acids are far more significant in thermophiles or mesophiles, they may not significantly alter the overall intramolecular interactions. For example, in the (α/β)8 fold, Arg is statistically significant, but ionic interactions are not statistically significant within this fold. Similarly in the β-jelly roll fold, Cys is statistically significant, but the disulfide bridges are not significant. We see a similar pattern for the (α/α)6 fold where although Glu is statistically significant, none of the intramolecular interactions are. These results suggest that subtle changes in interactions act as driving factors for thermostability.For thermophilic proteins, distinct folds have distinct factors that contribute to thermostability, suggesting a fold-specific protein analysis requirement to understand thermostability. Understanding the basis for thermostability aids in engineering enhanced protein activity, which can lead to more cost effective processes for many industrial applications. Our study sheds light on endoglucanases, which could possibly be exploited to increase biofuels crop production by designing a more efficient endoglucanase enzyme. The enzymes currently used in converting biomass to bioethanol for biofuel production have been derived from microorganisms. Unfortunately there are serious technological limitations on biofuel production due to low yield and high production costs for pre-processing enzymes like endoglucanases. Thus the ability to insert a more efficiently designed thermophilic endoglucanase into maize would be very exciting [1].A dataset of endoglucanase protein structures was obtained from the more than 100 glycoside hydrolase (GH) families within the Carbohydrate-Active enZymes database (CAZy) [38]. The enzyme classification number 3.2.1.4 was used to identify all endoglucanases from these various GH families and group them based upon their three-dimensional structural fold. Endoglucanase structures determined by either X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy were classified into one of three structural folds: (α/β)8, β-jelly roll, or (α/α)6. Using the primary citation of the PDB structure for conformation, each protein was identified as either thermophilic and mesophilic in the following manner: if the source organism's optimum growth temperature (TL) is above 40°C, then the protein was classified as thermophilic; if not, as mesophilic. We note that although the melting temperature (Tm) of a given protein is a better indicator of its thermostability than growth temperature of the organism, the melting temperature is not often widely available. For instance we sought Tm values for all the proteins in our dataset from the ProTherm database [39], but except for one thermophilic protein (pdb id: 1olr) and for one mesophilic protein (pdb id: 1oa2) the Tm values are unavailable. Previous studies comparing thermophilic and mesophilic proteins also have mentioned that unavailability of Tm values is a limiting factor [7]. Since we are only using this information to broadly classify proteins as thermophilic or mesophilic rather than define a direct correlation with Tm, we follow the precedent of classifying by TL [7].To ensure a similar degree of sequence variation within each of these protein subsets, proteins with greater than 70% sequence and structural similarity were removed using PISCES [40]. For a given set of PDB entries, PISCES uses Combinatorial Extension (CE) algorithm and PSI-BLAST alignments to create a subset of proteins that are evolutionarily related, but with low sequence identity. Our final datasets, listed in Table ​Table1,1, contained 17 thermophiles and 13 mesophiles.Following the results of previous thermophilic-mesophilic comparison studies [7,8], we calculated the statistical significance for several potentially stabilizing features derived from endoglucanase sequences and structures. Statistical significance was defined as having a p-value less than 5.0 × 10-2 (95% confidence interval) in an unpaired two-tail t-test using the statistical software R [41] between differences in mesophilic and thermophilic proteins. All the structures in Table ​Table11 are divided into thermophilic and mesophilic structure sets. The amino acid frequency for each type of amino acid was calculated for each protein. These amino acid frequencies were averaged within the family and used as input into the t-tests to determine which, if any, amino acids displayed a statistically significant difference. When an amino acid was observed to be statistically significant, (p < 0.05) then the set, thermophilic or mesophilic, that had a higher mean frequency was determined to be significantly richer in that amino acid. These tests were repeated for three different groupings of thermophilic and mesophilic sets: all endoglucanases, split by their catalytic mechanism, split by their fold. Additional features based upon intramolecular interactions and relative amino acid environment were compared in similar ways.DSSP [42] was used to determine the secondary structure of proteins. We used the following scheme to translate eight-letter DSSP code into a three-class scheme where secondary structure states of α helix (H), 3-10 helix (G), and π helix (I) are translated into helix; isolated β-bridge (B) and extended strand (E) are translated into sheet; and hydrogen bonded turn (T) and bend (S) are translated into loop. We also used DSSP to obtain a measure of relative solvent accessibility, Ai, for each residue, i. Equation 1 describes how the relative solvent accessibility is calculated.As suggested previously, this relative solvent accessibility, Ai, was classified as: (1) buried if less than 9%, (2) intermediate if between 9-36% and (3) exposed if more than 36% [43]. Another t-test was used to identify statistically significance differences between mesophilic and thermophilic endoglucanases for any amino acids with these various accessibility states. In these tests, the count of each type of amino acid participating in an accessibility state or secondary structure class was normalized by the total number of that particular amino acid type in each protein.Finally the Protein Interaction Calculator (PIC) [44] was used to calculate the intramolecular interactions, such as hydrophobic interactions; hydrogen bond interactions (main chain-main chain (MC-MC), main chain-side chain (MC-SC), and side chain-side chain (SC-SC)); disulphide bridges; ionic interactions (distance cutoff of 6Å) [45]; aromatic-aromatic interactions (distance cutoff of 4.5Å to 7Å) [46]; aromatic-sulfur interactions (distance cutoff of 5.3Å) [47]; and cation-π interactions (distance cutoff of 6Å) [48]. For statistical analysis, the number of interactions in each category was normalized by the number of residues in each protein.In order to identify similar regions in evolutionary related thermophiles and mesophiles, we structurally aligned proteins using the multiple structure alignment tool CE [49]. To check the accuracy of alignments we analyzed if the catalytic residues were aligned among the thermophiles and mesophiles. The results were visualized using PyMol [50]. With this simple check for alignment performance, we used the PHYlogeny Inference Package (PHYLIP) [51] to construct a phylogenetic tree of endoglucanases. The structure based multiple sequence alignments were given as input to PHYLIP and distances were calculated using maximum likelihood estimates based on the Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix [52]. Then, a neighbor-joining method was used to cluster the sequences using the distance matrix. Based on the clustered phylogenetic tree, we identified at least one pair of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins for each fold, that are structurally similar and evolutionarily related.TZS and JDW conceived the study and participated in its design and coordination and helped to draft the manuscript.

PMC3050522,A screen for deficiencies in GPI-anchorage of wall glycoproteins in yeast,False,"Many of the genes and enzymes critical for assembly and biogenesis of yeast cell walls remain unidentified or poorly characterized. Therefore, we designed a high throughput genomic screen for defects in anchoring of GPI-cell wall proteins (GPI-CWPs), based on quantification of a secreted GFP-Sag1p fusion protein. Saccharomyces cerevisiae diploid deletion strains were transformed with a plasmid expressing the fusion protein under a GPD promoter, then GFP fluorescence was determined in culture supernatants after mid-exponential growth. Variability in the amount of fluorescent marker secreted into the medium was reduced by growth at 18°C in buffered defined medium in the presence of sorbitol. Secondary screens included immunoblotting for GFP, fluorescence emission spectra, cell surface fluorescence, and cell integrity. Of 167 mutants deleted for genes affecting cell wall biogenesis or structure, eight showed consistent hyper-secretion of GFP relative to parental strain BY4743: tdh3 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), gda1 (guanosine diphosphatase), gpi13 and mcd4 (both ethanolamine phosphate-GPI-transferases), kre5 and kre1 (involved in synthesis of β1,6 glucan), dcw1(implicated in GPI-CWP cross-linking to cell wall glucan), and cwp1 (a major cell wall protein). In addition, deletion of a number of genes caused decreased secretion of GFP. These results elucidate specific roles for specific genes in cell wall biogenesis, including differentiating among paralogous genes.In yeasts, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchorage is essential for viability and for maintenance of normal cellular morphology (Leidich et al., 1994; Pittet and Conzelmann, 2007). GPI-anchored glycoproteins serve as surface receptors, hydrolytic enzymes, structural components and adhesion proteins in mating, and in the formation of flocs, mats and biofilms. Fungal biofilms are exploited in bioremediation (Ryan et al., 2005), bio-control of insect pests (Aanen et al., 2009), food and beverage production (Donalies et al., 2008) and to enhance the effectiveness of fertilizers in nutrient-depleted soil (Adesemoye and Kloepper, 2009). However, the ability of fungal biofilms to aggressively adhere to and infect a multitude of abiotic and biotic surfaces (Verstrepen and Klis, 2006) signifies a continuous threat to human welfare and human life, due to the inherent resistance of fungal biofilms to currently available antifungals (Jabra-Rizk et al., 2004; Nowak and Kurnatowski, 2009).GPI synthesis and addition have been well characterized in yeast. Briefly, glycoproteins are synthesized on ER-bound ribosomes, and a pre-assembled GPI anchor is substituted for a C-terminal hydrophobic signal by a transamidation reaction in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane prior to their export to the cell surface in specialized vesicles (Castillon et al., 2009). GPI anchor biosynthesis involves 20–30 different proteins that work in multiprotein complexes to assemble the anchor in a step-wise fashion (Orlean and Menon, 2007). Proteins with added GPI anchors are further modified with N- and O-linked sugars in the ER and Golgi prior to their transport to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, where they remain tethered through the lipid part of their GPI anchor. In fungi, some GPI anchors are further processed by cleavage at the anchor’s glycan part; this cleavage releases the protein with an attached GPI remnant into the cell wall space, where it becomes transglycosylated to cell wall β 1,6-glucan (Lu et al., 1995; Van Der Vaart et al., 1996). The mechanism and enzymes responsible for cell wall GPI–protein anchorage in fungi remain unresolved and are considered ideal antifungal targets because they are unique to fungi.A comprehensive genome-wide search for genes required for GPI–cell wall protein (CWP) anchorage in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae would contribute to the understanding of known components of this cellular pathway and highlight new ones. Our data would complement existing genome-wide surveys for cell wall genes (De Groot et al., 2001, 2003; Lagorce et al., 2003; Lussier et al., 1997; Murillo et al., 2005; Weig et al., 2004; Yin et al., 2007) in efforts aimed at investigating potential relationships between datasets obtained from different ‘omic’ approaches (Ge et al., 2003). This type of data integration is proving increasingly crucial for comprehensive and reliable understanding of cellular pathways.We have therefore developed a phenotypic screen for deficiencies in GPI–protein anchorage to the cell wall, using the commercially available S. cerevisiae gene deletion library. To our knowledge, no such mechanistically-based screen for wall assembly defects has been done before. Previous attempts for screening for GPI–CWP anchorage genes at a genome-wide level were abandoned because of high variance in the results, low protein yields and the possibility that the critical processes are encoded by redundant genes or by essential genes. All three issues have been successfully addressed, and we report the identification of several genes required for efficient anchorage of GPI-glycoproteins to the cell wall.Homozygous and heterozygote diploid deletion strains in the BY4743 background, isogenic to the sequenced strain S288C, were obtained from the Invitrogen collection. The specific deletions in strains identified in the screen were confirmed by colony PCR (data not shown). Yeast strains were grown in either YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or defined medium [0.2% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% ammonium sulphate, 2% glucose, and 0.08% complete synthetic medium (CSM) lacking uracil], containing 1 M sorbitol, buffered to pH 6.5 with 50 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) and supplemented with 200 μM geneticin (Sigma). Escherichia coli strains DH5α and XL10-Gold (Stratagene) were used as hosts for recombinant DNA manipulation. E. coli strains were grown in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium chloride, 0.1% glucose, 0.01% ampicillin).A GFP-labelled GPI–CWP was constructed as follows. An EcoRI–BglII fragment of the yeast-enhanced GFP (yEGFP) gene from Aequorea victoria was prepared by PCR, using pMut3-yEGFP (provided by Dr T. Hughes, Yale University, USA) as the PCR template. A BglII–XhoI fragment encoding the last 300 residues at the C-terminus of the cell wall glycoprotein α-agglutinin encoded by the SAG1 gene was similarly prepared, using pH27 as the PCR template (Lipke et al., 1989). A SpeI–EcoRI fragment encoding the invertase secretion signal and cleavage site was synthesized using overlapping oligomers of 51 and 53 base pairs (bp) each (see Supporting information, Table S1), extending the non-overlapping regions with Klenow DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs). Each fragment was subjected to restriction digestion with the indicated enzymes, subjected to DNA gel electrophoresis and recovered from the gel using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kits (Fisher Scientific). A four-fold ligation reaction involving all three restriction fragments described above and vector p416GPD (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), bearing SpeI–XhoI sticky ends, was performed using T4 DNA Ligase (New England BioLabs). Constructs were verified by restriction analysis and sequenced to exclude mutations. The resulting plasmids were propagated and purified from E. coli using Qiagen plasmid purification kits. The plasmids were transformed into yeast strains using the lithium acetate protocol (Amberg et al., 2005).High-throughput transformation of gene deletion strains was accomplished using the Bio101 EZ-Yeast Transformation kit. Transformants were grown at 15–18 °C in 13 × 100 mm borosilicate tubes in CSM — uracil, pH 6.5-buffered selective medium containing 1 M sorbitol. Growth in small test tubes allowed convenient monitoring of cell growth by taking the OD at 2 h intervals. Cultures at OD660 = 0.5–0.6 (1.6–2.0 × 108 cells/ml) were centrifuged and 500 μl of their cell-free supernatant stored at −80 °C in silicon-coated tubes in the presence of fungi-specific protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), a condition that minimized protein loss (data not shown). Stored supernatants were thawed on ice.Yeast strains transformed with pGFP–Sag1p and control samples transformed with plasmid lacking the reporter gene were grown to OD660 = 0.4–0.6. Cell samples were washed twice with 1 M sorbitol and then incubated in 10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 M sorbitol, pH 7.5, for 2 h to overnight to promote maximal GFP folding. An Olympus fluorescence microscope was used to visualize GFP with a fluorescein filter (excitation at 470 nm, emission at 530 nm) and a ×60 immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1.2.GFP amounts in supernatants of 167 cell wall gene deletion mutants and the parental strain were determined by single wavelength fluorescence spectroscopy, using a 96-well FLUOstar Optima microplate-reading fluorimeter from BMG Labtechnologies. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set a 488 and 520 nm, respectively. Complete fluorescence spectra were collected from the supernatants of several deletion mutants. Background fluorescence consisted of a single broad peak centred at 536 nm (18 657 cm−1) with a width at half height of 90 nm (3500 cm−1), as determined from wild-type cells transformed with empty vector DNA. This background fluorescence was subtracted from each experimental spectrum according to: 
The multiplier constant C was chosen to produce a corrected spectrum that matched as closely as possible the spectrum of the pure GFP from Clonetech. The only exception was mutant GPI13/gpi13. The relative fluorescence for each sample was taken as the height at the maximum point in the corrected spectrum. In the case of the GPI13/gpi13 this clearly underestimates the fluorescence, since this mutant emits more from the peak at 552 nm than other mutants.Yeast supernatants were recovered by high-speed centrifugation and 100 μl aliquots of the supernatants were applied to nitrocellulose membranes, using a 96-well BioRad dot-blotter/protein concentrator, as recommended by the manufacturer. This aliquot size was optimal for sensitivity and reproducibility (data not shown). Membranes were allowed to dry overnight and assayed for GFP levels, using monoclonal mouse anti-GFP antibodies and HRP-labelled goat anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma).For cell wall purifications, 50 ml cell suspension at 108 cell/ml was washed three times in Tris–PMSF buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.8) at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were resuspended in Tris–PMSF containing glass beads (diameter 0.45 mm) at a ratio of 1:1:1 (cell:buffer:glass beads, v/v/v). The cells were then homogenized by vortexing 10 times (each 1 min), with 1 min cooling intervals on iced water. The cell lysate was separated from the beads by repeated washings with 1 M NaCl, pH 7.5. The lysate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. The cell wall fraction recovered as insoluble material after centrifugation was washed twice with 1 M NaCl. This fraction was then treated with 1% SDS for 20 min at room temperature. The surfactants were removed by repeated washings with 1 M NaCl, followed by three washings with Tris–PMSF buffer (10 min each). The cell wall fractions were stored in 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.5.To confirm cross-linking of the GFP–Sag1p to cell wall polysaccharides, immunoelectron micrographs were prepared from wild-type cells. Cells from a mid-exponential culture were washed twice with 1% SDS and twice with 50 mM Tris–chloride, pH 7.5. The cell pellet was incubated overnight in 30 ml 1:500 monoclonal mouse anti-GFP antibody solution. The cells were then washed three times for 10 min each in PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, and incubated overnight in 1:2000 gold-labelled goat anti-mouse antibody. The cells were fixed in 5% formaldehyde. Electron micrographs were prepared in Dr Ronald Gordon’s laboratory at Mount Sinai Medical School, New York.For each strain tested, triplicate 5 ml cultures were grown to OD660 = 0.6–0.8, then centrifuged at high speed to remove the cells. The supernatant was frozen at −80 °C, lyophilized, concentrated 12.5-fold by resuspension in 400 μl water, then assayed in triplicate with Coomassie Plus Reagent (Pierce), with BSA as standard.We constructed a reporter plasmid (pGFP–Sag1p) that expressed a secreted and cell wall-anchored form of yGFP fused to the C-terminal 300 residues of the GPI cell wall protein Sag1p. The low copy plasmid p416-GPD was the vector (Figure 1A). Because irreversible damage to the GFP fluorophore occurs at pH levels <3.0 (Yang et al., 1996) and S. cerevisiae cultures can quickly reach such low pH levels, the cells were grown in medium buffered to pH 6.5 with 50 mM MOPS–Tris. Visualization of GFP fluorescence at the cell surface confirmed that the reporter protein was successfully expressed and processed as a cell surface protein (Figure 1D1). There was significantly less cell surface fluorescence in cells grown in unbuffered medium (data not shown). Cells transformed with vector p414GPD alone did not show cell surface fluorescence (Figure 1D3). Isolated cell walls from GFP–Sag1p-expressing cells remained fluorescent after treatment to remove non-covalently bound cell wall soluble protein (Klis et al., 2007) (Figure 1C1). Additionally, electron microscopy of GFP–Sag1p-expressing cells showed localization of the marker protein at the cell wall after treatment of the cells with gold-labelled anti-GFP antibodies (Figure 1B). Therefore, the GFP–Sag1p fusion protein was localized in the cell wall.Cell wall localization of GFP–Sag1p. (A) Schematic of pGFP–Sag1p reporter construct in low copy vector p416-GPD. (B1) Immunoelectron micrographs of wild-type cells expressing GFP–Sag1p labelled with mouse monoclonal anti-GFP as primary antibody and gold-labelled goat anti-mouse as secondary antibody. (B2) Immunoelectron micrograph of non-expressing cells. (C) Phase contrast and GFP fluorescence of isolated washed cell walls from BY4743 cells expressing GFP–Sag1p (C1) and BY4743 cells transformed with empty vector alone (C2). Cell surface fluorescence of: (D1) BY4743–GFP–Sag1p wild-type; (D2) KRE5/kre5 mutant; and (D3) non-expressing cellsInitially, levels of GFP in the growth supernatants were low and highly variable, due to GFP instability and differences in cell concentration or growth stage. A series of experiments increased both the sensitivity and reproducibility of immunoblot assays. When separate clones of BY4743 were grown at 18 °C and 30 °C, there were similar GFP levels in the supernatants among the different clones at each growth temperature. However, there were significantly greater GFP levels in supernatants from cultures grown at 18 °C (Figure 2A). The amount of secreted GFP–Sag1p also increased after growth in 1 M sorbitol (Figure 2C). In sorbitol-supplemented buffered cultures grown at 18 °C, GFP detected in the culture supernatant was maximal when the cells were at mid-exponential stage, OD660 nm = 0.5–0.6 (Figure 2C and data not shown).Immunoblot analyses of cell wall mutants and optimization of assays. (A) Growth at lower temperature increases GFP–Sag1p yields. Triplicate clones of BY4743 were grown at 30 °C (top) and 18 °C before assay.

Duplicate clones were grown without sorbitol or with sorbitol in the absence (left) or presence (right) of pepstatin A. (D) Effect of growth in pepstatin A (1 μM) on secretion of GFP–Sag1p in wild-type and three deletion strains. Each strain was grown in triplicate under standard conditionsThese studies were the basis for a standardized growth protocol for the pGFP–Sag1-transformed strains. Triplicate cultures of each strain were grown in buffered defined medium with 1 M sorbitol at 18 °C. The cultures were harvested at OD660 nm = 0.5–0.6 and supernatants were collected and frozen until assay by immunoblotting of 100 μl samples.The cell wall mutants kre1/kre1 and KRE5/kre5 hypersecrete GPI–CWPs (Lu et al., 1995). These strains presumably do so because of diminished levels of cell wall β-1,6-glucan, which is the cell wall polysaccharide to which the proteins are anchored (Shahinian and Bussey, 2000). As expected for KRE5/kre5 cells, more GFP was detected in cell-free supernatants from these cells than in those from wild-type (Figure 2B). KRE5/kre5 cells also showed significantly less cell surface fluorescence than wild-type cells (Figure 1D2 vs. 1D1), a result consistent with reduced cell wall anchorage of the GFP test protein.eGFP folds slowly and is susceptible to protease digestion in the culture supernatants (Yang et al., 1996). Therefore, we assayed secretion of GFP–Sag1p in cell wall mutants cwp1/cwp1 and kre1/kre1 after growth in the presence or absence of the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A (1 μM). In the presence of the inhibitor, both cwp1/cwp1 and kre1/kre1 strains hypersecreted relative to wild-type (Figure 2C). Similarly, in the presence of pepstatin A, a dcw1/dcw1 strain hyper-secreted the marker protein (Figure 2D). Pepstatin A also increased the marker protein detected from the dfg5/dfg5 strain, but to levels only slightly greater than the wild-type BY4743. DFG5 is paralogous to DCW1.GFP–Sag1p secretion levels were determined for parental strains BY4743 and for 167 strains missing genes implicated in cell wall biogenesis. These genes were selected from three independent groups of genes previously ascribed a cell wall function: (a) 268 genes whose deletions affect sensitivity to K1 killer toxin (Page et al., 2003); (b) 103 genes listed in SGD as cell wall genes (http://www.yeastgenome.org); and (C) 171 cell wall-related genes identified in an in silico study in S. cerevisiae (Coronado et al., 2007). All genes common to all three groups and those shared between two groups were selected for screening. Of 45 genes shared between two groups, seven failed to transform and could not be screened.The GFP fluorescence values from wild-type and mutant culture supernatants were ranked and plotted. The data are shown in Figure 3 (see also Supporting information, Figure S1, Tables S2, S3). Seventeen mutants were hypersecretors, by the criterion that their mean fluorescence was greater than the mean plus standard error (SE) for wild-type. 38% of the 167 gene deletants secreted less GFP–Sag1p than wild-type, on the basis that their mean fluorescence was lower than the mean minus SE for the wild-type. Of the 17 potential hypersecretors, seven were positive in a second immunoblot assay (Figure 4A). The additional hypersecretors confirmed by dot-blot analysis were YGR192CΔ (tdh3/tdh3), YLL031CΔ (GPI13/gpi13), YKL165CΔ (MCD4/mcd4 ) and YEL042WΔ (gda1/gda1 ). For these four mutants and the hyposecretor nsr1/nsr1, complete fluorescence spectra were determined as described in Materials and methods. In accordance with the immunoblot, nsr1/nsr1 cells showed a fluorescence peak substantially lower than that observed for wild-type cells (Figure 4B, C).Supernatant fluorescence values for representative mutants. Mutant strains were grown without pepstatin A in triplicate at 18 °C to mid-log phase in osmotically stable medium buffered to pH 6.5, and supernatants were assayed for GFP fluorescence. Mutant names and genotypes are given in Table S2 (see Supporting information). Mean and SEM values (dashed lines) are shown for the wild-type BY4743–GFP–Sag1 strain and for mutant strains (error bars)Confirmation of hyper- and hyposecreting mutants.

(B2) corrected spectrum for BY4743. (B3–B7) Background-corrected fluorescence spectra from supernatants from BY4743 (dashed lines), selected mutants (dotted lines) and purified GFP (solid lines) as reference. The relative fluorescence for each sample was taken as the height at the maximum point in the corrected spectrum (C). Cells were grown without pepstatin ATo estimate relative cell surface fluorescence intensities for these strains, the samples were photographed with a series of exposure times in a fluorescence microscope and we visually matched the exposure time for each to the wild-type BY4743. For instance, in a comparison of wild-type and GPI13/gpi13 (Figure 5A, C, respectively) the one-thirtieth of a second exposure for GPI13/gpi13 cells showed comparable intensity to the one-fifteenth of a second exposure of wild-type cells. Therefore, the fluorescence of GPI13/gpi13 cells was twice that of the wild-type cells. MCD4/mcd4 cells were also slightly brighter than wild-type cells (Figure 5A, B). The tdh3/tdh3 and gda1/gda1 strains were ~two-fold less bright than wild-type (Figure 5F–H). GPI13/gpi13 and gda1/gda1 cells had cell separation defects and increased fluorescence near the septa (Figure 5D, E).Cell surface GFP fluorescence of BY4743 and selected mutants.

At the bottom are matched exposures of (I) BY4743, (J) dcw1/dcw1 and (K) dfg5/dfg5There was no significant difference between wild-type and mutant cells in the total protein present in growth supernatants (data not shown), suggesting that higher GFP–Sag1p levels in mutant supernatants are not the result of cell lysis.To confirm the lack of cell lysis or leakage of intracellular protein/components due to cell wall damage, cell-free supernatants were also examined for presence of the cytosolic protein phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). This enzyme was used as a marker because of its abundance and the commercial availability of an antibody. Immunoblots showed that there was more PGK in supernatants from wild-type BY4743 cells than in those from any of the hyper-secreting mutants (see Supporting information, Figure S2).Note that cell membrane damage or lysis should release large amounts of PGK into the medium, regardless of whether or not some of the protein is localized in the wall, as has been previously reported (Alloush et al., 1997; Angiolella et al., 1996; de Groot et al., 2007).The rationale for the phenotypic screen was that strains missing genes required for GPI–CWP processing or cell wall anchorage would retain a GFP-labelled GPI–CWP protein within the cell (hyposecretors), or secrete the fluorescent protein into the growth medium (hypersecretors), relative to wild-type cells. Additionally, defective strains would exhibit altered levels of cell surface fluorescence relative to wild-type cells. Here, we identified strains with each phenotype.The value of our experimental design lies in its functionality as a high-throughput approach to uncover genes required for fungal adhesin attachment to the fungal wall. Previous studies demonstrate hypersecretion of fluorescently labelled GPI-protein in some strains, although no approach has been taken to survey the genome in its entirety. Genome-wide surveys for genes encoding GPI-mannoproteins have been done in silico (De Groot et al., 2003). Mass spectrometry has identified and quantified cell wall GPI-proteins, but this approach has only been extended to a few cell wall mutants (de Groot et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2008). Our genome-wide approach is designed to handle the systematic assay of hundreds of strains at a time. Hyper- and hyposecretion of the marker is reproducibly assayed in a 96-well plate reading fluorimeter. Therefore, the procedure is easily replicable and adaptable to a range of fungi and growth conditions.Initially, we found that a high-throughput fluorescence assay for secretion of GFP–Sag1p was feasible, but showed unacceptable variability (see Supporting information, Figure S1). This variability resulted from uncontrolled pH, lack of osmotic support and variations in growth. Variability was reduced by growth at reduced temperature in the presence of 1 M sorbitol in defined medium at pH 6.5, to mid-exponential phase (Figure 2). Under these conditions, there was also reproducibility in cell surface fluorescence and minimal cell lysis (Figures 2, ​,5;5; see also Supporting information). The assay was validated in cell wall mutant KRE5/kre5, known to hypersecrete GPI–CWPs and have reduced GPI–CWP levels at the wall.It is clear that the inclusion of pepstatin A in the culture medium affected the levels of GFP–Sag1p detected in the supernatants (Figure 2C, D). For the kre1/kre1, cwp1/cwp1, dcw1/dcw1 and dfg5/dfg5 strains, the amount of marker protein was greater after growth with protease inhibitor. Paradoxically, pepstatin A caused a no change or a very slight reduction in supernatant GFP–Sag1p in wild-type cells and in the GPI13/gli13 strain (Figure 2D). This unexpected result is explained on the basis that yapsins, GPI-anchored aspartyl proteases, may act as ‘shedases’ that cleave GPI–CWPs (including the yapsins themselves) from the wall (Gagnon-Arsenault et al., 2008). Based on rough quantification, about 10 ng/ml mannoprotein is shed into the growth medium, or about 10% of the cell surface content in wild-type cells (Figure 4A). We speculate that in wild-type strains, pepstatin A will inhibit shedding of the marker protein into the medium. In the case of the mutants unable to properly anchor GFP–Sag1p to the wall, pepstatin A will inhibit yapsins that have been secreted into the medium (Yao et al., 2009), therefore stabilizing the GFP marker protein. Important to note is that previous studies reporting GPI–CWP hypersecretion in kre1 and other cell wall mutants employed antibodies against highly glycosylated GPI–CWPs that are not as susceptible to proteolysis (Lu et al., 1995; de Groot et al., 2001). These proteins would remain detectable in the absence of protease inhibitors such as pepstatin A (Walsh and Chapman, 1991). The conclusion is that the addition of pepstatin A to growth media does not affect growth, but adds to the sensitivity of the screening assay by enhancing differences in GFP–Sag1p secretion between mutant and wild-type cells. Assays under both conditions provide complementary information by allowing detection of hypo-, mild and hypersecreting phenotypes relative to wild-type. The latter are often detected without inclusion of pepstatin A, as demonstrated in Figure 2B, whereas the addition of pepstatin A brings out weaker phenotypes (Figure 2D). Although at the concentration used in our studies pepstatin A does not affect growth rate (data not shown), we chose to perform the screen without pepstatin A because of important roles assigned to yapsins in cell wall remodelling and maintenance of cell wall integrity (Krysan et al., 2005).We screened 167 mutants involved in cell wall assembly and biogenesis (Brown et al., 1993; Page et al., 2003; Rodriguez-Pena et al., 2005; Smits et al., 1999). Hyper- or hyposecretion was confirmed by immunoblotting and by collecting complete fluorescence spectra. The strains were also analysed for cell surface fluorescence and levels of cytosolic and total protein in the culture medium. Eight of the selected 167 cell wall mutants exhibited clear deficits in anchoring our GPI–CWP reporter protein to the cell wall. Five of these genes are non-essential (TDH3, GDA1, KRE1, CWP1 and DCW1 ) and three are essential (MCD4, GPI13 and KRE5).MCD4 and GPI13 are phosphoethanolamine (EtN-P) transferases involved in GPI-anchor biosynthesis. As in other organisms, these enzymes form part of the GPI anchor biosynthetic complex, where they add ethanolamine phosphate side chains to the mannose residues of the glycan part of the GPI-anchor (Gaynor et al., 1999; Taron et al., 2000; Toh-e and Oguchi, 2002). To date, three EtN-P transferases have been described in S. cerevisiae: Mcd4p, Gpi7p/Las21p and Gpi13p add EtN-P groups to the first, second and third mannose residues, respectively, of the glycan core of the GPI anchor (Gaynor et al., 1999). The essentiality of GPI13 is expected because it adds EtN-P to the C6 hydroxyl group of the third mannose of the GPI anchor, and it is through this EtN-P group that the GPI-anchor is linked to protein via an amide bond (Tiede et al., 1999). In gpi13 disruptants, GPI anchors are not attached to proteins through other EtN-P groups, and reduction of GPI anchoring leads to overall cell wall fragility (Flury et al., 2000). Our studies show that cells heterozygous for a GPI13 deletion hypersecrete GFP–Sag1p and have increased cell surface fluorescence relative to wild-type cells. It is likely that in these cells the synthesis of GPI-proteins is upregulated to compensate for the high failure rate of forming the protein-GPI amide linkage. This would also help to explain the relatively strong fluorescence that we observed in these cells at sites of active cell wall synthesis, such as during daughter cell growth and the formation of new budding cells (Figure 5D). We also observed that GPI13/gpi13 cells have a septation defect that leads to the formation of multibudded cells (Figure 5E). In this class of mutants, defects in GPI synthesis lead to deficits in anchor addition to precursor GPI-proteins and to subsequent decreases in GPI-protein targeting to the plasma membrane and the cell wall, where they are required for cell wall formation, remodelling and integrity. Similar responses may occur in GPI13/gpi13 cells that would lead to septation defects and overproduction and hypersecretion of GPI-anchored cell wall proteins that we observed in this strain. Although these defects are predictable in GPI13/gpi13 cells, this study provides the first experimental evidence that GPI13 is required for normal GPI-protein anchorage to the fungal wall and that heterozygous deletions of this gene are haplo-insufficient. The value of GPI13 as an anti-fungal target deserves closer examination (Hong et al., 2000; Almeida, 2005; Grimme et al., 2001).Mcd4p catalyses the addition of EtN-P to the first mannose in the GPI anchor. Mcd4p is required for GPI anchoring, because these mutants exhibit cell wall fragility and are defective in ER-to-Golgi transport of multiple GPI-anchored proteins (Yada et al., 2001). This deficit in targeting GPI-proteins to their final destination is believed to cause the aberrant phenotypes observed in mcd4ts cells, such as cell separation defects and abnormal bud site emergence and cell morphology (Gaynor et al., 1999). Since deficits in GPI-anchor biosynthesis inevitably compromise cell wall integrity, it seems logical to assume that mcd4 mutations can result in activation of the cell wall stress response and the subsequent upregulation of GPI-mannoproteins responsible for repairing and stabilizing cell wall integrity. This would help to explain the increase in cell surface GFP–Sag1p and in the levels of secreted GFP–Sag1p that we observed in MCD4/mcd4 cells relative to wild-type cells. Mcd4p is essential for fungal growth and dispensable for mammalian cell viability (Yada et al., 2001). The value of MCD4 as a novel antifungal target is corroborated by findings that the terpenoid lactone BE49385A, which inhibits the modification of mannose one of the GPI-anchor with EtN-P, is lethal to yeast cells (Hong et al., 1999).The defects caused by gpi13 and mcd4 are similar to that in gpi7Δ cells and other mutants deficient in GPI anchor biosynthesis (de Groot et al., 2001). However, our screen did not identify gpi7/gpi7 as either a hyper- or a hyposecretor under the standard growth conditions in the absence of pepstatin A.GDA1 encodes a guanosine diphosphatase (GDPase) which is involved in adding mannosyl residues to proteins and sphingolipids in the Golgi (Lopez-Avalos et al., 2001). The donor of the mannosyl residues is the nucleotide sugar GDP-mannose. GDP-mannose is synthesized in the cytosol and translocated into the Golgi lumen by a transporter, Vrg4p (Berninsone et al., 1995; Dean et al., 1997; Warit et al., 2000). Following mannosylation of lumenal proteins and lipids, GDP is converted to GMP by Gda1p. A Golgi membrane antiporter then exchanges the lumenal GMP for cytosolic GDP-mannose (Berninsone et al., 1995). Therefore, deletion of Gda1p blocks the transport of GDP-mannose into the lumen of the Golgi and subsequently both O- and N-glycosylation are impaired (Abeijon et al., 1993). Whether the underglycosylated GPI–CWPs can still anchor to the cell wall is currently not known. Our results showed much lower than wild-type levels of GFP–Sag1p at the wall in gda1/gda1 cells, and hypersecretion of the reporter protein into the growth medium (Figures 4, ​,5).5). These observations imply that underglycosylated proteins are excluded from being cross-linked to the wall and are subsequently excreted. These phenotypes are consistent with observations that C. albicans gda1/gda1 cells are more susceptible to the action of β-1,3-glucanases, perhaps due to a thinner outer layer of cell wall proteins which protects the underlying β-1,3-glucan network from glucanases (De Nobel et al., 1991; Ellerton et al., 2008). Notably, we did not see increases in the level of intracellular protein in the growth medium of these gda1/gda1 cells, so it is likely that increased GFP levels in the medium is not due to leakage of intracellular components. Our data are consistent with the idea that proper glycosylation is required for protein to anchor onto the wall.TDH3 encodes an isozyme of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a highly expressed glycolytic enzyme. The presence of classic cytosolic enzymes at the cell surface has been considered an artifact (Klis et al., 2007), but GAPDH can direct intracellular proteins to the cell wall (Alloush et al., 1997; Edwards et al., 1999; Pardo et al., 1999). For instance, a fusion of intracellular S. cerevisiae invertase (ScSUC2 ) to C. albicans TDH3 expresses invertase activity at the cell surface, presumably from regions in TDH3 capable of targeting the fusion protein to the cell wall (Delgado et al., 2003). Cell wall localization of GAPDH was further established in S. cerevisiae by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis with a polyclonal antibody against S. cerevisiae GAPDH (Gil-Navarro et al., 1997). In C. albicans and S. cerevisiae, the GAPDH protein is detected at the outer surface of the cell wall and in the cytoplasm of wild-type cells by immunoelectron microscopy (Delgado et al., 2001). We note that neither tdh1/tdh1 nor tdh2/tdh2 strains hypersecreted GFP–Sag1p in our screen (see Supporting information, Tables S1–S3) and therefore Tdh3p may have a non-redundant role in cell wall biogenesis.DCW1 and DFG5 encode putative glycosidase/transglycosidases homologous to bacterial family 75 (Cantarel et al., 2009). Recently, these genes have been implicated in GPI anchor cleavage and transglycosylation of the GPI-anchor remnant protein to cell wall polysaccharides. However, their exact role in the processes remains to be determined. Dcw1p and Dfg5p are GPI-mannoproteins of the plasma membrane, although in C. albicans Dfg5p also localizes to the cell wall (Spreghini et al., 2003). Deletion of DCW1 renders cells hypersensitive to the cell wall-digesting enzyme zymolyase, whereas deletion of DFG5 does not lead to an observable phenotype (Kitagaki et al., 2002). Both single deletants exhibit normal morphology and grow normally in rich and synthetic media. DCW1 and DFG5 are functionally redundant and show synthetic lethality, which can be rescued by a plasmid expressing DFG5 from the GAL1 promoter. The rescued mutant hypersecretes cell wall GPI-mannoproteins and becomes hypersensitive to cell wall-disrupting agents following glucose repression (Kitagaki et al., 2002). In S. cerevisiae, DFG5 and DCW1 are required for bud formation (Kitagaki et al., 2004), while DFG5 is required for agar invasion and growth at alkaline pH (Mosch and Fink, 1997). In C. albicans, these genes have similar functions: at least one of them is required for growth (Spreghini et al., 2003) and DGF5 is required for hyphal development (Spreghini et al., 2003). Clearly, Dcw1p and Dfg5p play an important role in cell wall biogenesis. We have shown that dcw1/dcw1 null mutants hypersecreted GFP–Sag1p and have reduced levels of the protein at the wall relative to wild-type cells. However, the cells required growth in the presence of pepstatin A for detection of the phenotype.In conclusion, the fusion protein secretion assay can reliably distinguish between yeast strains with different deletions. The screen has shown that some deletions increase secretion of GPI–CWPs to the medium, whereas others do not. The assay will be useful in screening antifungal drugs and in elucidating the physiological consequences of mutations and potential anti-fungal compounds.Figure S1.

PMC3051899,Arsenal of plant cell wall degrading enzymes reflects host preference among plant pathogenic fungi,False,"The discovery and development of novel plant cell wall degrading enzymes is a key step towards more efficient depolymerization of polysaccharides to fermentable sugars for the production of liquid transportation biofuels and other bioproducts. The industrial fungus Trichoderma reesei is known to be highly cellulolytic and is a major industrial microbial source for commercial cellulases, xylanases and other cell wall degrading enzymes. However, enzyme-prospecting research continues to identify opportunities to enhance the activity of T. reesei enzyme preparations by supplementing with enzymatic diversity from other microbes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the enzymatic potential of a broad range of plant pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi for their ability to degrade plant biomass and isolated polysaccharides.Large-scale screening identified a range of hydrolytic activities among 348 unique isolates representing 156 species of plant pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify groups of species with similar hydrolytic profiles. Among moderately and highly active species, plant pathogenic species were found to be more active than non-pathogens on six of eight substrates tested, with no significant difference seen on the other two substrates. Among the pathogenic fungi, greater hydrolysis was seen when they were tested on biomass and hemicellulose derived from their host plants (commelinoid monocot or dicot). Although T. reesei has a hydrolytic profile that is highly active on cellulose and pretreated biomass, it was less active than some natural isolates of fungi when tested on xylans and untreated biomass.Several highly active isolates of plant pathogenic fungi were identified, particularly when tested on xylans and untreated biomass. There were statistically significant preferences for biomass type reflecting the monocot or dicot host preference of the pathogen tested. These highly active fungi are promising targets for identification and characterization of novel cell wall degrading enzymes for industrial applications.The recalcitrance of lignocellulose to enzymatic degradation and the high cost of hydrolytic enzymes required for depolymerization of polysaccharides found in the plant cell wall are significant barriers to the large-scale production and commercialization of biofuels and bioproducts derived from plant biomass [1]. In order to rapidly increase production of cellulosic biofuels and bioproducts there is a need to develop more efficient and cost effective enzyme mixtures for the conversion of biomass to fermentable sugars [2]. In order to address this challenge, a better understanding of the interactions between plant cell wall polysaccharides and the diversity of cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDE) needed for efficient hydrolysis is essential.The complexity of cell wall polysaccharides is one factor which contributes to the resistance of biomass to efficient hydrolysis for bioenergy production. Plant cell walls are heterogeneous and dynamic structures, composed of polysaccharides, proteins and aromatic polymers. Cell wall composition and structures differ among plant lineages [3]. The cell walls of Angiosperms (flowering plants) and Gymnosperms (including conifers) all contain cellulose microfibrils embedded in a matrix of pectin, hemicellulose, lignin and structural proteins, but the types and relative amounts of these structural polymers differ among groups of plants and also change as the wall matures. For example, the walls of the Poales (grasses) and other commelinoid monocots differ from dicots and non-commelinoid monocots in several ways. Type I cell walls found in non-commelinoid monocots and dicots are generally rich in xyloglucan and pectin. In contrast, the type II cell walls of commelinoid monocots contain glucuronoarabinoxylan as the major non-cellulosic polysaccharide. Commelinoid monocots are also unique in having mixed-linkage β-1,3(1,4)-glucans [3-5]. There are additional differences in the types of lignin and ferulic acid esterification found in grasses and dicots [3,6]. In addition to the physical complexity of the cell wall, it is a dynamic structure that changes as the plant grows and ages. During cell wall maturation from a primary to secondary wall in both monocots and dicots, the amounts of xyloglucans, pectins and structural proteins decrease while the amount of xylans and lignin increase. The major constituents of typical secondary cell walls are cellulose (35%-45% dry weight in grasses, 45%-50% in dicots), xylans (40%-50% in grasses, 20%-30% in dicots) and lignin (20% in grasses, 7%-10% in dicots) [4]. Thus the sugars found in cellulose and xylans are the major carbon source for fermentation of biofuels and other bioproducts.The complexity of the plant cell wall is mirrored by the diverse arsenal of CWDE produced by lignocellulose-degrading microbes. Each type of structural polysaccharide-degrading enzyme is represented in multiple families determined by sequence and structural similarities [7-10]. The Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes Database (CAZy) categorizes cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4 and 3.2.1.91) in at least 12 different glycosyl hydrolase (GH) families, and xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8 and 3.2.1.37) in 12 GH families [11]. Some GH families contain both cellulases and xylanases (such as GH5) while others contain cellulases but no xylanases (GH7) or vice versa (GH11). Genomic analysis of lignocellulose-degrading fungi shows that a single species can have the genetic capacity to produce many different enzymes with similar functional designations (cellulase, xylanase and others). For example, the genome of the phytopathogen Magnaporthe grisea is predicted to encode at least 30 enzymes in six GH families for the degradation of cellulose and 44 enzymes in 11 families for the degradation of hemicellulose (Fungal Genome Initiative, Broad Institute, http://www.broadinstitute.org/science/projects/fungal-genome-initiative). When compared to six other filamentous Ascomycete fungal genomes, the industrial cellulase-producing fungus Trichoderma reesei has a similar number of GH families for cellulose degradation and slightly fewer GH families for hemicellulose degradation [12]. However, T. reesei contains the smallest total number of genes encoding cellulases and xylanases compared to six fungal genomes. The genome of the phytopathogen Fusarium graminearum has twice the number of genes encoding cellulases and xylanases as T. reesei, and the genome of M. grisea contains three times as many [12]. Despite having relatively few genes coding for CWDE, engineered strains of T. reesei, such as RUT-C30, produce large quantities of extracellular enzymes, and culture broths are highly effective at the depolymerization of cellulose because of the abundance of cellulases produced [13-15].As a result of the complexity of lignocellulosic biomass, there is potential to supplement the limited repertoire of commercial CWDE by complementation with enzymatic diversity from other sources [12,16]. For example, the supplementation of a blend of commercial enzymes [Celluclast (from T. reesei) and Novozyme 188 (from Aspergillus niger); Novozymes A/S (Bagsvaerd, Denmark)] with culture broths from several fungal species at a level of only 10% of the total protein in the reaction was sufficient to stimulate cellulose hydrolysis to twice the benchmark activity of the commercial enzymes alone [17]. Proteins in family GH61 have recently been identified as factors that enhance the hydrolysis of lignocellulose while being weakly or non-hydrolytic by themselves [1,18]. The precise mechanism of GH61 stimulation of lignocellulose hydrolysis remains elusive, but insights from the related CBP21 that acts on insoluble chitin suggest both an oxidative and a hydrolytic step, which may result in the disruption of substrate crystallinity and increased accessibility to recalcitrant polysaccharides [19]. The genome of T. reesei appears to encode very few GH61 proteins compared to other filamentous Ascomycetes, including the phytopathogens F. graminearum and M. grisea [12]. Interestingly, even the genome of Blumeria graminis (a biotrophic phytopathogen that lacks canonical lignocellulolytic enzymes) encodes several GH61 enzymes, raising questions about the biological roles of these proteins in addition to their biotechnological applications [20].Most plant-associated microbes (both pathogenic and saprophytic) that break down plant cell walls have the genetic capacity to produce enzymes for the degradation of the major structural polysaccharides found in the cell wall, namely cellulose, xylan and pectin [21,22]. In particular, plant pathogens have intimate relationships with their hosts, requiring penetration of the cell wall and colonization of living host tissue. Many pathogenic fungi actively kill and degrade plant tissue and utilize liberated carbohydrates for growth and reproduction. Plants produce proteins to inhibit microbial CWDE as one mechanism of disease resistance, and this interaction may drive evolution of unique enzymes in phytopathogens. For example, inhibitors of pectin-degrading enzymes are common in dicots and the pectin-rich non-commelinoid monocots [23]. These proteins have also been reported in wheat [24] and rice [25] and may be involved in control of growth and development. More commonly found in grasses are inhibitors of xylan-degrading enzymes [26-28]. Following plant senescence, pathogenic fungi may continue to colonize and overwinter on dead tissue, and many plant pathogens are also competitive saprophytes [29]. Although it is unlikely that the differences in cell wall composition between monocots and dicots are sufficient to determine host specificity, there is some evidence that plant pathogens may produce different amounts of specific CWDE depending on whether the plant host is a monocot or dicot and whether fungi are grown on cell walls from monocots or dicots [30,31].Both plant pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi could provide a rich source of CWDE to complement T. reesei and other industrial enzyme sources for biofuel and bioproduct production. In order to identify promising taxa with high hydrolytic activities for more detailed characterization and to evaluate whether the suite of CWDE produced by plant pathogens reflects host specificity, we have analysed the hydrolytic enzyme profiles of 156 species of fungi and oomycetes using multiple polysaccharide substrates. These substrates included purified cellulose and hemicellulose, pretreated biomass similar to materials for bio-refineries and untreated plant cell walls representing agricultural by-products and dedicated biofuel crops.An initial sampling of 12 phytopathogenic fungi was used to test the effect on CWDE production for three growth media with switchgrass (SG), soybean stem (SS) or Avicel as the primary carbon source. Data were collected for hydrolysis of nine different polysaccharide or biomass substrates. A full-factorial mixed-effect model was built with host (monocot or dicot), substrate and medium treated as fixed effects and isolate as a random effect. The third order interaction of host*substrate*medium was significant (P = 0.0135), as was the second order interaction of medium*substrate (P = 0.0184) and the primary effect of substrate (P = 0.0009). For all assay substrates, extracts from fungi grown on the Avicel-based medium released either comparable amounts or fewer reducing sugars than cultures grown on SG- or SS-based media, as determined by pairwise t-tests of fitted data from the model (see Additional File 1, Figure S1). The only example where extracts from Avicel medium were noticeably more active than the SG or SS media was the case of dicot pathogens hydrolyzing filter paper (FP). However, this difference was not significant as determined by pairwise t-tests (P = 0.0822 for dicot pathogens grown on Avicel compared to SG and P = 0.1097 for Avicel compared to SS).When data from cultures grown on Avicel were removed and a mixed-effect model was fitted using standardized data from only biomass-based media (SG and SS), the second order interactions of substrate*host (P < 0.0001) and substrate*medium (P = 0.0091) were significant. The primary effects of host (P = 0.1319) and medium (P = 0.7287) were non-significant and the effect of substrate was barely non-significant (P = 0.0506). Extracts from cultures grown on SG medium released more sugar than cultures grown on SS medium when tested on the two xylans [arabinoxylan from oat (AXO) and xylan from birch (XY)] and the two grasses [corn stalk (CS) and SG]. The opposite trend was seen for hydrolysis of xyloglucan (XG) and the two legumes [alfalfa (AL) and SS] with cultures grown on SS-based medium releasing more sugar than cultures grown on SG-based medium. Although the model found this substrate*medium effect to be significant, pairwise t-tests of both standardized data and values fitted from the model were found to be non-significant. For the host*substrate interaction, extracts from dicot pathogens were significantly more active than monocot pathogens when tested for hydrolysis of the dicot substrates XG (P = 0.0385), SS (P = 0.0017) and AL (P = 0.0008). Other substrate*host interactions were not significant. The significant interaction between plant host and dicot substrates indicated preferential hydrolysis of monocot and dicot cell walls and host-specific cell wall polysaccharides depending on the host range of pathogens.This preferential hydrolysis of monocot and dicot cell walls prompted us to look at host preference using a much larger data set capturing a greater diversity of fungi. Recent proteomic studies of F. graminearum showed that supplementation of minimal medium with pectin resulted in a total of 13 pectinases and pectate lyases being expressed, while induction with xylan induced seven pectin-degrading enzymes and of these six were induced in both cases. For xylan-degrading enzymes, supplementation with xylan induced 14 xylanases or arabinofuranosidases. Supplementation with pectin only induced seven xylan-degrading enzymes; of these, five were also induced by xylan. When the researchers supplemented minimal medium with either dicot (carrot) or monocot (maize) cell walls, the induction of pectin and xylan degrading enzymes was much more similar. When supplemented with either dicot or monocot cell walls, 12 common pectin-degrading enzymes were detected while only two additional unique enzymes were induced by dicot cell walls and only one unique pectin-degrading enzyme by maize cell walls. Similarly, both dicot and monocot cell walls induced a common set of 22 xylan-degrading enzymes, with an additional two unique enzymes induced by monocot cell walls and only a single unique enzyme induced by dicot cell walls [32]. As microbial CWDE synthesis is primarily induced by low levels of simple monosaccharides, and because these sugars are found in the majority of both monocot and dicot cell walls, it is expected that both monocot and dicot cell walls will induce similar types of enzymes by microbes [22]. This does not rule out a minor, quantitative difference in CWDE induction profiles for monocot- or dicot-based growth media, but because we observed the effect of growth medium to be subtle and not statistically significant when SS- and SG-based media were compared, cultures for the large-scale screening were grown solely on SG-based medium.A total of 348 unique isolates was tested for hydrolysis of FP, three types of hemicellulose (arabinoxylan from wheat (AXW), XY and XG), biomass from two grasses (CS and SG) and biomass from two legumes (AL and SS; see Additional File 2, Table S1). Most isolates were from the kingdom Fungi (344, 98.9%). Only four (1.1%) isolates were Oomycetes in the kingdom Chromista. The majority of isolates (317, 91.1%) were in the division Ascomycota, with fewer isolates from the Basidiomycota (22, 6.3%) and the Zygomycota (5, 1.4%). At the class level, most isolates were in the Sordariomycetes (190, 54.6%) and the Dothideomycetes (91, 26.1%). The most highly represented subclasses were the Hypocreomycetidae (129, 37.1%), the Pleosporomycetidae (70, 20.1%) and the Sordariomycetidae (58, 16.7%). On the order level, the Hypocreales (121, 34.8%) and the Pleosporales (70, 20.1%) were most highly represented. The families Nectriaceae (103, 29.6%), Glomerellaceae (41, 11.8%), and Pleosporaceae (37, 10.6%) contained the greatest number of isolates. The two most sampled genera were Fusarium (101, 29.0%) and Colletotrichum (41, 11.8%).Negative controls of extracts in the absence of substrate did not react with 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS). Negative controls of substrates and buffer in the absence of hydrolytic enzymes detected small amounts of reducing sugar (less than 0.12 mg/mL) from the reaction of DNS with soluble compounds present in the mostly insoluble substrates, small amounts of contamination by fine particulate matter and decreased sensitivity of the DNS reaction at very low sugar concentrations. This background was subtracted from measured sugar values and negative values were adjusted to zero. The fungi tested showed a broad range of activity on eight substrates (see Additional File 3, Figure S2). T. reesei RUT-C30 was roughly twice as active as the top natural isolates when tested for hydrolysis of FP and SS. T. reesei RUT-C30 also stood out as being highly hydrolytic on the other substrates with the exception of the two xylans. Although many species were weakly or non-hydrolytic, some species exhibited activity greater or equal to T. reesei when assayed on either untreated biomass or xylans. Many species were represented by multiple isolates, and we observed that some isolates within a species were highly active, while others showed weaker activities. Although these studies were conducted with dried plant biomass or purified cell wall components, there have been some indications that the production of CWDE is related to fungal lifestyle, either pathogenic or saprophytic [33]. One possibility is that variability in CWDE activity might be related to isolate virulence. In a study of eight isolates of Mycosphaerella graminicola, several pathogenicity components were positively correlated with production of xylanase and pectinase in vitro, implying that CWDE may be key determinants of pathogenicity [34]. The ability of the fungus to successfully colonize plant mesophyll tissues was also strongly correlated with the production of endo-beta-1,4 xylanase activity in planta in a study of 26 isolates of M. graminicola [35].Ranking and ordering of species based on hydrolysis of diverse substrates is challenging since the activity on one substrate may be very different than on another. For example, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was ranked third for hydrolysis of FP but 39th for hydrolysis of XY. Hierarchical clustering was used to provide a useful way to organize the moderately large dataset into meaningful groups and to identify coherent patterns. Clustering of the complete dataset (excluding T. reesei) identified two major groups of species (see Additional File 4, Figure S3). The top tier of 86 (55%) species showed moderate or strong hydrolysis of most substrates tested. A bottom tier contained 69 (45%) inactive or very weakly active species. All species tested from the genera Bipolaris (4), Colletotrichum (7), Penicillium (3), Rhizoctonia (4), Sclerotinia (4) and Trichoderma (5) were in the top tier of active isolates. The genus Fusarium was represented by 20 species, the greatest number of any genus. Most species of Fusarium (17) fell in the top tier of active species. However, three species (F. decemcellulare, F. lateritium and F. merismoides) were average or below average and fell in the bottom tier. Of the nine species tested within the genus Aspergillus, four species (A. lineolatus, A. awamori, A. fumigatus and A. niger) clustered in the active group, while five species (A. candidus, A. janus, A. penicilloides, A. peyronelii and A. proliferans) fell in the bottom tier.Data from the weakly active tier of species was excluded, and the top tier containing 86 species with moderate or strong hydrolytic activities was used for further analysis, revealing a cluster of 27 very highly active species (Figure ​(Figure1).1). In particular, the species F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum, A. fumigatus, Penicillium expansum, Mucor hiemalis, Rhizoctonia cerealis, S. homeocarpa, Cylindrocarpon didymum, T. viride, Macrophoma phaseolina and Penicillium sp. had activities greater than two standard deviations from the mean for at least one of the eight substrates tested and also had high activity on most other substrates. In addition to these broadly active species, Sclerotium rolfsii and Rhizopus sp. had activity greater than two standard deviations from the mean for hydrolysis of XG and S. sclerotiorum had activity greater than two standard deviations from the mean for hydrolysis of FP. However, these three isolates were not extremely active across a broad range of substrates. Several species of Fusarium (Fusarium sp., F. acuminatum, F. avenaceum, F. incarnatum, F. graminearum, F. crookwellense, F. moniliforme, F. culmorum, F. compactum, F. proliferatum and F. oxysporum) clustered together and were highly active on grass cell walls and xylans, as well as being higher than average on most other substrates. Three species of Trichoderma (T. viride, T. koningii, and T. harzianum) clustered together and had very high activity on XG and good activity on other substrates. Some species, such as all four species of Bipolaris, had activities near or above the mean for AXW and XY, but were average or below average for other substrates. All isolates showed growth on quarter strength potato dextrose agar (PDA), but it is possible that the use of a minimal medium, based on SG where biomass is the major carbon source, may have been sub-optimal for growth of some fungi. Negative results from this study do not rule out a species as producing active CWDE. Nevertheless, these data identify numerous species that are very capable of hydrolyzing cellulose, hemicellulose and lignocellulosic biomass.Hierarchical clustering of active species. Heatmap showing the mean activities and clustering of 86 species of plant pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi when assayed for hydrolysis of eight polysaccharide substrates [XG, xyloglucan (from tamarind); FP, filter paper; AL, alfalfa; SS, soybean stems; SG, switchgrass; CS, corn stalks; AXW, arabinoxylan (from wheat); XY, xylan (from birch)]. Weakly and inactive species were excluded. Trichoderma reesei RUT-C30 was excluded because of its unusual hydrolytic activities. Negative estimations of reducing sugars were adjusted to zero and data were standardized within substrates by subtracting the substrate mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Dendrogram and ordering was determined using the distance matrix computation (dist) and hierarchical clustering (hclust) functions in R. Red colors indicate values greater than the substrate mean, while blue colors indicate values less than the mean. Column Z-score and color intensity indicate how many standard deviations the species mean is from the substrate mean.In addition to identifying clusters of species with similar activities, the substrates also clustered showing biological significance. The two grass substrates (CS and SG) clustered together as did the two legume substrates (AL and SS). These two groups of cell walls [grass (monocot) and legume (dicot)] are clearly distinct from each other as reflected in hydrolysis by diverse microbes. This also indicates that some suites of enzymes produced by microbes are more suited for breaking down grass cell walls, while other suites of enzymes are more suited for breaking down legume cell walls. Both xylans tested (XY and AXW) clustered together. FP and XG did not cluster closely with any other substrates.A smaller set of top isolates was recultured and tested using a greater number of substrates and hydrolysis times. Data from a subset of isolates with the highest activity for each substrate and time were standardized within each substrate and time. The standardized values were averaged for the two timepoints, and organized using hierarchical clustering (Figure ​(Figure2).2). Among the top plant pathogenic isolates, S. homeocarpa 86-190 showed very good activity on isolated cellulose and xylans, as well as most types of grass cell wall biomass. F. oxysporum 85-031 was above average on both untreated and pretreated grasses. The hypercellulolytic mutant, T. reesei RUT-C30, shows an unusual pattern of hydrolytic activity. It was highly active on the two pure cellulosic substrates tested [FP and bacterial microcrystalline cellulose (BMCC)] as well as the three pretreated biomass samples [acid pretreated corn stover (PCS), acid pretreated switchgrass (PTSGA) and base pretreated switchgrass (PTSGB)]. However, when compared with the other top isolates, T. reesei was the weakest isolate for hydrolysis of the three xylans (AXW, AXO, XY) and five of six types of untreated grass cell walls [SG, eastern gammagrass/switchgrass mix (EGG/SG), big bluestem/switchgrass mix (BBS/SG), tall fescue (TF) and reed canarygrass (RC)]. This clearly illustrates the skewed hydrolytic profile of T. reesei, which emphasizes cellulase production that is essential for hydrolysis of pretreated grasses where cellulose is the major component. However, high production of cellulases may result in relatively ineffective hydrolysis of the more complex and heterogeneous untreated plant cell walls in which lignin and hemicellulose may limit cellulose accessibility. For hydrolysis of untreated biomass, high xylanase activity could directly increase the amount of five carbon sugars (mainly xylose and arabinose) as well as stimulate cellulose hydrolysis, perhaps by improving cellulose accessibility. Increased hydrolysis of glucans in pretreated grass cell walls has been reported by supplementing T. reesei cellulases with endoxylanase, arabinofuranosidase, α-glucuronidase, acetyl xylan esterase, ferulic acid esterase and other activities [36-38]. Accessory enzymes that facilitate more complete utilization of plant biomass could be used to develop less energetically and chemically intensive pretreatments and allow for greater fermentable sugar recovery, especially for five carbon sugars derived from hemicellulose.Hierarchical clustering of top isolates and Trichoderma reesei. Heatmap showing mean activities and clustering of the top isolates on each substrate and T. reesei when assayed for hydrolysis of 14 polysaccharide substrates [SG, switchgrass; CS, corn stalk; EGG/SG, eastern gammagrass/switchgrass mix; BBS/SG, big bluestem/SG mix; TF, tall fescue; AXW, arabinoxylan (wheat); AXO, arabinoxylan (oat), XY, xylan (birch); RC, reed canary grass; BMCC, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose; FP, filter paper; PTSGB, base pretreated SG; PTSGA, acid pretreated SG; PCS, acid pretreated corn stover]. Each substrate was hydrolyzed for two lengths of time and the mean of those two timepoints was used for clustering. Selected isolates showed the highest activity on at least one substrate and at least one timepoint. Measured reducing sugars were standardized within substrates by subtracting the substrate mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Dendrogram and ordering was determined using the distance matrix computation (dist) and hierarchical clustering (hclust) functions in R. Red colors indicate values greater than the substrate mean, while blue colors indicate values less than the mean. Column Z-score and color intensity indicate how many standard deviations the isolate mean is from the substrate mean.Species identified as being weakly active when tested on most substrates in the initial clustering of all 155 species were excluded from further statistical testing (see Additional File 4, Figure S3). As some taxa were sampled more frequently than others (for example, Fusarium), a mixed-effect model was used to compare groups of fungi for lifestyle (pathogenic/non-pathogenic) and host specificity (monocot/dicot) where genus, species and isolate are treated as random effects. By treating taxonomic ranks as random, increased sampling within a taxonomic group will not affect the mean of the larger grouping (lifestyle and host specificity) but will give a more accurate estimation of variance for the group. In the top tier of 86 active species, 17 species could confidently be identified as pathogens primarily of dicots, 28 as pathogens of monocots and 16 as non-pathogenic (Table ​(Table1).1). Among these, several genera (Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Phoma and Sclerotinia) included some species pathogenic on monocots and others pathogenic on dicots. The large number of pathogenic species with known host specificity and the number of species classified as non-pathogenic provides a robust data set to use mixed-effect modelling to test whether hydrolysis of plant cell walls and cell wall polysaccharides reflects a difference between pathogenic and non-pathogenic lifestyles and for pathogenic species if hydrolysis reflects host preference.Species used for comparison of lifestyle (pathogenic or non-pathogenic) and host specificity (monocot or dicot).All species were in the top tier of 86 active isolates as determined by clustering analysis using the complete data set. This subset of species was used to test the effect of lifestyle (pathogenic/non-pathogenic) and host specificity (monocot/dicot) on hydrolysis of eight polysaccharides and plant cell walls. For testing lifestyle, three additional pathogens of woody species were also included, Cylindrocarpon didymum, Fusicoccum aesculi and Schizophyllum commune.A mixed-effect model was fitted using lifestyle (pathogen or non-pathogen), substrate (FP, XG, XY, AXW, AL, SS, CS, SG) and the lifestyle*substrate interaction as fixed effects. Genus, species and isolate were treated as nested random effects. Lifestyle by itself was not significant (P = 0.5346), but substrate (P < 0.0001) and the lifestyle*substrate interaction (P < 0.0001) were highly significant, indicating that on at least one substrate there was a significant difference between activities of pathogens and non-pathogens. Pairwise t-tests comparing pathogens and non-pathogens for each substrate found that pathogens were more hydrolytic on six of eight substrates (P < 0.005, Figure ​Figure3).3). There was no significant difference between pathogens and non-pathogens when tested on XG (P = 0.059) or XY (P = 0.08). Although more isolates of pathogenic fungi than non-pathogens were tested, treating genus, species and isolate as random effects reduced the sampling bias; these results indicate a significant trend and highlight the powerful suite of CWDE produced by many plant pathogenic fungi. Not only do pathogens often rely on CWDE for breaching the physical barrier presented by plant cell walls and rapid colonization of plant tissue, many pathogens are also capable of saprophytic growth on senesced plant tissue. Efficient CWDE may allow plant pathogens to quickly colonize dead plant material and outcompete environmental saprophytes and also provide a carbon source required for growth and reproduction.Interactions between lifestyle (pathogenic or non-pathogenic) and substrates. Fitted values from mixed-effect model on activity standardized within substrates. Lifestyle [non-pathogenic (NP) or pathogenic (P)], substrate (FP, XG, XY, AXW, AL, SS, CS, SG) and the lifestyle*substrate interaction were treated as fixed effects; genus/species/isolate were nested random effects. Data used for this analysis included 47 species of pathogens and 16 species of non-pathogens. Non-pathogenic and pathogenic species are the same as presented in Table 1 with the addition of three pathogens of woody species, Cylindrocarpon didymum, Fusicoccum aesculi and Schizophyllum commune. Pathogenic species had significantly higher activity on the substrates FP, AXW, AL, SS, CS and SG as determined by pairwise t-tests on fitted values from the model (P < 0.005). There was no significant difference on XG (P = 0.059) and XY (P = 0.08). The middle black bar at the center of the notch indicates the median value, edges of boxes indicate the interquartile range and whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values.A similar model to the pathogenic/non-pathogenic lifestyle model was fitted using host preference (monocot or dicot) in place of lifestyle. Both fixed effects of host (P = 0.0071) and substrate (P < 0.0001) were significant, as was the host*substrate interaction (P < 0.0001). When pairwise t-tests were performed comparing pathogens of monocots and dicots on each substrate, there were significant differences in all cases (P < 0.001, Figure ​Figure4).4). Pathogens of dicots showed slightly greater hydrolysis of FP, and although the difference was significant, the median value of monocot pathogens was greater than the median value for dicot pathogens. Similarly, monocot pathogens showed significantly greater hydrolysis of XY than dicot pathogens, but the interquartile ranges for the two host groups were nearly the same. However, for dicot cell walls (AL and SS) and dicot-specific hemicellulose (XG), pathogens of dicots clearly showed greater hydrolytic activity than pathogens of monocots. In contrast, for monocot cell walls (CS and SG) and monocot-specific hemicellulose (AXW), pathogens of monocots clearly showed greater hydrolytic activity than pathogens of dicots. These results provide strong evidence that among plant pathogens with the capacity to degrade plant cell walls, pathogens of monocots are better adapted for degradation of monocot cell walls while pathogens of dicots are better adapted for degradation of dicot cell walls, reflecting host preferences.Interactions between hosts (monocot or dicot) and substrates. Fitted values from mixed-effect model on activity standardized within substrates. Host preference of pathogenic fungi [dicot (D) or monocot (M)], substrate (FP, XG, XY, AXW, AL, SS, CS, SG) and the host*substrate interaction were treated as fixed effects; genus/species/isolate were nested random effects. Data used for this analysis included 17 species of dicot pathogens and 28 species of monocot pathogens. Dicot pathogens had significantly higher activity on the substrates FP, XG, AL and SS as determined by pairwise t-tests on fitted values from the model (P < 0.0005). Monocot pathogens had significantly higher activity on the substrates XY, AXW, CS and SG (P < 0.001). The middle black bar at the center of the notch indicates the median value, edges of boxes indicate the interquartile range and whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values.The observation that pathogens of monocots are better adapted for degradation of monocot cell walls may have industrial applications for the processing of mixed biomass containing a variety of plant types, including grasses and legumes. By tailoring industrial enzyme mixtures similarly to the way in which plant pathogens have evolved specialized CWDE systems for monocots and dicots, it may be possible to achieve more efficient hydrolysis of diverse biomass feedstocks. Although most lignocellulolytic fungi have the capacity to degrade most plant cell wall polysaccharides, these results provide compelling evidence for the adaptation of phytopathogens for degradation of cell walls and hemicellulose from their host of preference. A few genera were well represented with multiple species and isolates, allowing a comparison among species within a genus with multiple hosts. The genera Colletotrichum and Fusarium contain some species pathogenic on monocots and other species pathogenic on dicots. In the genus Bipolaris, all species tested were pathogens of monocots. When hydrolytic preferences were examined at the species level within these genera, similar results were observed when all data were considered suggesting that host specificity is reflected in hydrolytic activity at the species level within a genus.One challenge when screening an unknown pool of organisms for biological activity is capturing the greatest variation in a reasonable number of samples. In order to assess the contribution of taxonomic rank on variance in the data, a mixed-effect model was fitted for the response of standardized activity with family as a fixed effect. Genus, species and isolate were treated as nested random effects. T. reesei and the bottom tier of 69 weakly active species were excluded from the dataset. Based on hydrolysis of eight substrates by 248 isolates of plant pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi from 86 species and 45 genera, taxonomic hierarchy (genus, species, isolate) accounted for roughly 42% of the total observed variance. Genus-to-genus variance contributed 5.3% to the total variance, species-to-species variance accounted for 17.8% of the total variance and isolate-to-isolate variance accounted for 18.5% of the total variance. This indicates that greater variation is seen at the species and isolate level and further screening at the sub-generic level will probably reveal significant variation. Therefore, after the identification of promising genera, further screening within the genus will probably detect a wide range in activity. Similarly, after the identification of promising species, there is still significant variation among isolates which may reveal superior candidates. This approach is warranted, particularly if a genus or species is suspected of being hyper-variable. Such variability is commonly seen when phytopathogenic isolates are examined for virulence traits [39,40]. In Cochliobolus carbonum, a targeted gene knockout of a regulatory gene resulted in mutants with low levels of pectinases and other CWDE and with reduced virulence on maize, supporting that these enzymes play an important role in pathogenicity [41]. Virulence may be a useful selection criterion with which to identify the most promising isolates as is suggested by the relationship between the positive correlation of CWDE and measures of pathogenicity, such as lesion size and disease development [33-35]. This study itself does not directly explore sources of variance, however it could be due to many factors including multiple isoforms or copies of similar enzymes, variation in total production or secretion of hydrolytic enzymes and different suites of CWDE diversity. Earlier work to identify virulence factors in plant pathogens pointed to the presence of multiple forms of enzymes with similar functions, such as pectinases [33,42], that were associated with infection of living plant tissues. Recent surveys of fungal genomes clearly indicate that these organisms are replete with many types of CWDE classes and genes [12]. Most pathogenic isolates tested were isolated directly from the field, and many of these isolates had comparable or higher hydrolytic activity than the engineered strain T. reesei RUT-C30 when tested on untreated biomass and hemicellulose. This natural diversity of CWDE could provide a large reservoir that can be further improved by engineering enzymes and strains for increased performance.The results presented here clearly illustrate that plant pathogens are promising sources in which to discover highly active CWDE that would be useful for more efficient lignocellulosic digestion. Genomic analysis of several plant pathogens indicates an abundance of CWDE, particularly when compared with T. reesei [12]. While T. reesei produces a CWDE system that results in efficient hydrolysis of pure cellulose and pretreated biomass, this high cellulase activity does not confer exceptional hydrolysis of untreated plant biomass. Several plant pathogens were identified as highly competent degraders of untreated biomass. Compared to T. reesei, many plant pathogens had higher xylanase activity and some highly active isolates had greater activity than T. reesei when tested on grass cell walls. Specifically, the species F. avenaceum, F. incarnatum, F. graminearum, F. crookwellense, F. moniliforme, F. culmorum, F. compactum, F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum, Phytophthora sojae, A. fumigatus, P. expansum, M. hiemalis, R. cerealis, S. homeocarpa, S. sclerotiorum, S. trifoliorum, C. didymum, T. viride, T. koningii, T. harzianum, Chaetomium funicola, M. phaseolina, S. rolfsii, Leptodontium elatius, as well as the unidentified species Fusarium sp., Penicillium sp. and Rhizopus sp. are promising candidates in which to discover highly active enzymes in one or more classes of CWDE. Although we did not test synergism directly, enhancement of T. reesei cellulases with crude enzyme preparations from other fungi has been documented and may lead to the identification of novel accessory enzymes for biomass hydrolysis [1,17,18,43]. Any of the top candidates identified in this study would be good candidates for closely controlled synergy experiments in future work. Some of these taxa may contain novel enzymes with unique activity, such as GH61. In addition, a closer examination of the CWDE systems employed by these naturally highly active taxa may provide insights to guide the engineering of multi-enzyme cocktails based on established enzymatic activities and synergies.Pathogenic species showed greater hydrolysis than non-pathogenic species for all substrates tested except xyloglucan from tamarind and xylan from birch, on which there was no significant difference between the groups. Among pathogenic species, pathogens of monocots had relatively higher hydrolysis of monocot hemicellulose (arabinoxylan) and cell walls (corn stalk and switchgrass), while pathogens of dicots preferentially hydrolyzed dicot hemicellulose (xyloglucan) and cell walls (alfalfa and soybean stem). Together, these results show that many plant pathogenic fungi are highly competent producers of lignocellulolytic enzymes, specialized on their preferred hosts, and a promising source from which to find accessory enzymes that may complement the highly cellulolytic CWDE system of T. reesei.A total of 348 isolates from 156 species in 93 genera were used in this study (see Additional File 2, Table S1). Unless noted otherwise, isolates were obtained from the New York Field Crop Pathogen Culture Collection (NYFC, Gary Bergstrom, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA) or the Cornell Plant Pathology Teaching Culture Collection (CPP, David Kalb, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA). Frozen stocks of spores and/or mycelium were stored in 20% glycerol at -80°C. Isolates were plated on quarter strength potato dextrose agar (PDA; 6 g potato dextrose broth (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), 16 g agarose, 1L H2O) and grown for seven days at 25°C. Five subcultures of each isolate were made by transferring 6 mm plugs from PDA cultures to biomass- or cellulose-based agar media modified from the ATCC cellulose medium 907 (0.5 g (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 g L-asparagine, 1 g KH2PO4, 0.5 g KCl, 0.2 g MgSO4, 0.1 g CaCl2, 0.5 g yeast extract, 16 g agarose, 5 g cellulose or biomass, 1 L H2O) in 50 mm Petri dishes. For use as the carbon source in the cellulose-based agar medium, Avicel (FMC BioPolymer, type PH-101, 50 mm, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was used. For biomass-based media, dry switchgrass (SG; Panicum virgatum cv. 'Blackwell', 15 + 4 year stands, Pawling, NY, USA) and soybean stems (SS; Glycine max from Phil Atkins, Cornell University Department of Crop and Soil Sciences, Ithaca, NY, USA) were milled to pass through a 20 mesh screen. Cultures were grown on these media for an additional 10 days before freezing at -80°C. Cultures were then thawed and chopped into roughly 1 cm2 pieces and extracted in 11 mL of buffer (0.1 M Na acetate, 0.02 M NaCl, 0.02% Na azide, pH 5.5) for 2 h at room temperature: 1.5 mL aliquots of extracts were placed into individual wells of 2 mL 96-deepwell plates (Eppendorf AG, Deepwell Plate 96, 2000 μL, Hamburg, Germany) and frozen at -80°C until assayed.Hydrolysis of various polysaccharide substrates was conducted in 96 well microplates [44]. Two cellulosic substrates were used: FP (7 mm discs of Whatman No. 1 1001070, Maidstone, UK) and BMCC (CPKelco Cellulon Press Cake, K5C486-SC3 010133A, Atlanta, GA, USA). Four hemicellulosic substrates were used: XY (Sigma X0502, St. Louis, MO, USA), AXO (Sigma X0627, MO, USA), AXW (Megazyme P-WAXYI, Wicklow, Ireland) and XG (Megazyme P-XYGLN, Wicklow, Ireland). Several types of untreated biomass milled to 0.5 mm were tested: CS (Zeae mays from Gary Bergstrom, Cornell University Department of Plant Pathology and Plant-Microbe Biology, Ithaca, NY, USA), SG (see previous description), SS (see previous description), as well as AL (Medicago sativa cv. 'Oneida VR'), RC (Phalaris arundinacea cv. 'Bellevue'), TF (Festuca arundinacea cv. 'Bull'), biomass from a mixed BBS/SG stand (Andropogon gerardii cv. 'Bonanza'/P. virgatum cv. 'Cave-in-Rock'), and from a mixed EGG/SG stand (Tripsacum dactyloides cv. 'Pete'/P. virgatum cv. 'Cave-in-Rock'), all of which were provided by Hilary Mayton (Cornell University Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Ithaca, NY, USA) unless otherwise noted. Three types of pretreated biomass were tested: dilute base pretreated SG (PTSGB; same batch of SG as previously described), dilute acid pretreated SG (PTSGA; same batch of SG as previously described) and dilute acid pretreated CS (PCS; from Daniel Schell, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, CO, USA). SG pretreatment was performed in 10 g batches. For dilute base pretreatment, a 5% SG (w/w) suspension in 1% NaOH (w/w) was incubated at 25°C and shaken at 200 rpm for 24 h. For dilute acid pretreatment of SG, a 7% SG suspension in 0.75% H2SO4 was autoclaved at 121°C for 1 h. Pretreatments were neutralized afterwards. All biomass samples and BMCC were washed at least five times by centrifugation in three volumes of distilled water to remove background simple sugars prior to use in assays.Hydrolysis reactions were conducted by mixing fungal extracts in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with 2% substrate (dry weight substrate/total volume of suspension or solution). For insoluble substrates, the total reaction volume was 180 μL and was conducted in flat-bottom microplates (Corning Life Sciences, Costar flat bottom 3370, Corning, NY, USA). Insoluble slurries were prepared in small beakers and kept under constant agitation with magnetic stir bars while pipetted by hand into microplates using truncated pipette tips (Laboratory Product Sales Inc, L111806, Rochester, NY, USA). For soluble substrates, the total reaction volume was 50 μL and was conducted in conical-bottom microplates (Eppendorf AG, 96-well twin.tec, Hamburg, Germany). Plates were sealed with aluminum sealing film (Axygen, PCR-AS-200, Union City, CA, USA) and incubated at 37°C for various times depending on the substrate and experiment, then frozen. In order to test the effect of growth medium, nine substrates were used (FP, CMC, XY, AXO, XG, SG, CS, SS, AL). Hydrolysis of AXO and XY was conducted for 1 h, XG for 2 h, CMC for 6 h, FP for 24 h and SG, CS, SS and AL for 72 h. The major screening of all 348 isolates was conducted by culturing five replicates of each isolate on SG agar. Extracts were tested for hydrolysis of eight substrates (AL, AXW, CS, FP, SG, SS, XG, XY). XY was hydrolyzed for 1 h, XG for 2 h, AXW for 10 h, FP for 24 h and SG, CS, SS and AL for 72 h. Fresh extracts from the top isolates were re-cultured and re-tested. Extracts from these cultures were tested on a broad range of substrates (AXW, AXO, XY, FP, BMCC, SG, CS, RC, TF, BBS, EGG, SGA, SGB, PCS). For each substrate, hydrolysis was stopped at two time points. AXO and XY were hydrolyzed for 1 h and 3 h, AXW for 3 h and 11 h, BMCC for 18 h and 72 h, and all other substrates for 72 h and 168 h.The colorimetric assay based on 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) for estimating total reducing sugars was employed in a microplate format [44-47]. The DNS reagent was prepared by dissolving 10.6 g of DNS and 19.8 g NaOH in 1416 mL ddH2O, then adding 306 g Rochelle salts (NaK tartrate), 7.6 mL phenol, and 8.3 g Na metabisulphite [48]. DNS reagent was allowed to sit for one week prior to use. Following completion of enzymatic reactions, 50 μL of hydrolysate was carefully removed in order to avoid disturbing and pipetting any insoluble undigested substrate, and added to 100 μL of DNS solution in 96 conical-well plates (Eppendorf AG, 96-well twin.tec, Hamburg, Germany). For BMCC, plates were centrifuged to compress the non-hydrolyzed substrate prior to removal of hydrolysate. In order to minimize plate-to-plate variation, each plate contained three replicates of sugar standards in buffer for the linear range of the DNS assay (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mg/mL glucose or 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mg/mL xylose). Plates were sealed with silicone compression mats (Axygen, CM-FLAT, Union City, CA, USA) and heated in a thermocycler (MJResearch Inc, PTC-100, Waltham, MA, USA) for 5 min at 95°C followed by cooling and holding at 20°C. If the initial analysis of hydrolysate contained more sugar than the linear range of the DNS assay, samples were retested by a double dilution before adding DNS reagent. For analysis, 36 μL of the completed DNS reaction were diluted in 160 μL ddH2O in a flat-bottom microplate. Absorbencies were measured at 540 nm and sugar concentrations were calculated from a linear regression of the standards. Pipetting was either done manually using a multichannel pipettor, or was automated using an epMotion 5075 liquid handling system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany).Data were analysed using the software package R (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria, 2009). An initial group of 12 monocot pathogens and 12 dicot pathogens were arbitrarily selected from the NYFC culture collection to represent a diversity of fungal species. Each isolate was replicated three times on each of the three media based on Avicel, SG and SS. Extracts were assayed for hydrolysis of nine substrates (AL, AXO, CMC, CS, FP, SG, SS, XG, XY). Of the initial 24 isolates selected, the 12 showing the greatest hydrolysis were selected for further analysis. These included six pathogens of grasses and six pathogens of legumes (see Additional File 2, Table S1).Raw data were corrected by subtracting background reducing sugars from each substrate as determined by an enzyme-free buffer blank. In order to facilitate direct comparisons among substrates, sugar concentrations were standardized within substrates by centering and scaling the data (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation). A linear mixed-effects model was fit for the response standardized activity starting with a full factorial model using the effects host (monocot or dicot), medium (Avicel, SG, SS), and substrate (FP, CMC, XY, AXO, XG, AL, SS, CS, SG) as fixed effects and isolate as a random effect. The analysis was repeated excluding data from Avicel-grown cultures.For the large-scale screening of 348 unique isolates, five cultures were extracted for each isolate. Extracts were assayed for hydrolysis of eight substrates (AL, AXW, CS, FP, SG, SS, XG, XY). The mean background sugars were subtracted from the data for each substrate and data were again centered and scaled. Data from all isolates except T. reesei RUT-C30 were ordered and grouped using the distance matrix computation (dist) and hierarchical clustering (hclust) functions in R. Heatmaps were generated using the function heatmap.2 in the gplots package. The package RColorBrewer was used for colorizing the heatmaps. The hypercellulolytic mutant T. reesei RUT-C30 was excluded from this analysis because of its unusual hydrolytic activity on cellulosic materials compared to natural isolates.In order to test the interaction of lifestyle (pathogen or non-pathogen) and host preference (monocot or dicot) with substrates, a subset of isolates was created for species in the top tier identified by clustering analysis and those which could be confidently assigned a host (monocot, dicot or non-pathogen). All pathogens of monocots were pathogens of commelinoid monocots with the exception of F. oxysporum f. sp. tulipae that is a pathogen of tulip, a non-commelinoid monocot with cell walls resembling dicots. This isolate was treated as a dicot pathogen for statistical analysis. Data were standardized by centering and scaling. A mixed-effect model was built for the response of standardized activity using the fixed effects of lifestyle or host, substrate and the interaction lifestyle*substrate or host*substrate. Genus, species and isolate were treated as nested random effects. The linear mixed-effects model (lme) function in the package nlme was used for all modelling.A mixed-effect model was fitted in order to test the effect of taxonomic hierarchy as a source of variation in hydrolytic activity. Data from all isolates in the top tier (excluding T. reesei RUT-C30) were standardized by centering and scaling. Family was treated as a fixed effect, while genus, species and isolate were treated as nested random effects. Variance components were calculated as a percentage of total variance by squaring the standard deviations of each random effect, and dividing by the total variance.AL: alfalfa; AXO: arabinoxylan from oat; AXW: arabinoxylan from wheat; BBS/SG: big bluestem/switchgrass mix; BMCC: bacterial microcrystalline cellulose; CAZy: carbohydrate active enzyme database; CS: corn stalk; CWDE: cell wall degrading enzyme(s); DNS: 3,5- dinitrosalicylic acid; EGG/SG: eastern gammagrass/switchgrass mix; FP: filter paper; GH: glycosyl hydrolase; PCS: acid pretreated corn stover; PTSGA: acid pretreated switchgrass; PTSGB: base pretreated switchgrass; RC: reed canarygrass; SG: switchgrass; SS: soybean stem; TF: tall fescue; XG: xyloglucan from tamarind; XY: xylan from birch.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.KDW, NVN and BCK cultured the organisms for enzyme extraction and KDW isolated some of the organisms used in the study.

Interactions among hosts, growth media, and substrates. Fitted values from mixed-effect model on activity standardized within substrates. Data are from six dicot (d) pathogens and six monocot (m) pathogens grown on Avicel (A), switchgrass (SG) and soybean-stem (SS) supplemented minimal media. The lower case letter on the x-axis label indicates pathogen host (d, m) and the upper case letters indicate growth media (A, SG, SS). Each set of plots is for nine different substrates (FP, CMC, XY, AXW, XG, AL, SS, CS, SG). The effects of host, media and substrate, as well as their interactions, were treated as fixed effects and isolate was treated as a random effect. The third order interaction of host*substrate*medium was significant (P = 0.0135), as was the second order interaction of medium*substrate (P = 0.0184) and the primary effect of substrate (P = 0.0009).

PMC3059304,Identification of surface proteins in Enterococcus faecalis V583,False,"Surface proteins are a key to a deeper understanding of the behaviour of Gram-positive bacteria interacting with the human gastro-intestinal tract. Such proteins contribute to cell wall synthesis and maintenance and are important for interactions between the bacterial cell and the human host. Since they are exposed and may play roles in pathogenicity, surface proteins are interesting targets for drug design.Using methods based on proteolytic ""shaving"" of bacterial cells and subsequent mass spectrometry-based protein identification, we have identified surface-located proteins in Enterococcus faecalis V583. In total 69 unique proteins were identified, few of which have been identified and characterized previously. 33 of these proteins are predicted to be cytoplasmic, whereas the other 36 are predicted to have surface locations (31) or to be secreted (5). Lipid-anchored proteins were the most dominant among the identified surface proteins. The seemingly most abundant surface proteins included a membrane protein with a potentially shedded extracellular sulfatase domain that could act on the sulfate groups in mucin and a lipid-anchored fumarate reductase that could contribute to generation of reactive oxygen species.The present proteome analysis gives an experimental impression of the protein landscape on the cell surface of the pathogenic bacterium E. faecalis. The 36 identified secreted (5) and surface (31) proteins included several proteins involved in cell wall synthesis, pheromone-regulated processes, and transport of solutes, as well as proteins with unknown function. These proteins stand out as interesting targets for further investigation of the interaction between E. faecalis and its environment.Enterococci are versatile Gram-positive bacteria that can survive under harsh conditions. Most enterococci are non-virulent and commonly found in fermented food and in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans and animals. Other strains are opportunistic pathogens that contribute in a large number of nosocomial infections worldwide [1]. The mechanism underlying the switch from a harmless microbe into a life-threatening pathogen entering the host bloodstream is not well known. It is believed that the bacteria normally are well controlled in the GI tract of healthy individuals, whereas a weakened host immune system and/or development of bacterial traits to occupy new niches may lead to translocation to the bloodstream [2]. The past decade has shown a dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance of Enterococcus species, creating an increased need for developing new ways to combat these bacteria. To achieve this, in-depth insight in the physiology, virulence and epidemiology of enterococci is required.Enterococcus faecalis is one of the most frequent Enterococcus species in the GI tract [3,4] and accounts for at least 60% of the bacteraemia caused by Enterococcus species [1]. The genome sequence of three E. faecalis strains (V583; [5], OG1RF [6], Symbioflor 1 [7]) have been completed, and several genome projects are ongoing. In the genome sequence of E. faecalis V583, a vancomycin resistant clinical isolate, over a quarter of the genome consists of mobile or foreign DNA, including pathogenicity islands. The abundance of mobile elements in E. faecalis probably contributes to accumulation of virulence and drug determinants. Several studies have revealed proteins that contribute to the virulence of E. faecalis [8-10], but it has so far not been possible to link virulence to one or very few key gene products. Since virulence depends on the ability to colonize the GI tract and interact with host cells and proteins in the GI tract, secreted proteins and proteins located on the cell surface are thought to be important. One well-studied secreted virulence factor is cytolysin, which is toxic or lytic to bacterial and human cells [9,11]. Several adhesion factors facilitating binding to mucosal and epithelial surfaces have been reported [2]. In addition to involvement in adhesion, surface proteins may affect virulence in other ways, for example by involvement in cell-cell signalling [9], interactions with the host immune system, sensing environmental factors, or protection from environmental factors.To understand the success of bacterial pathogens and their adaption to the GI tract it is important to get an impression of the repertoire of surface associated proteins. According to the LocateP database [12], which contains genome-wide predictions for the subcellular locations of bacterial proteins, 306 proteins in E. faecalis are predicted to be covalently anchored to cell surface, primarily via N-terminal or lipid anchors. Another 67 are predicted to be secreted or non-covalently attached to the surface. There is only limited experimental data supporting these predicted locations [13]. Furthermore, despite their expected importance for bacterial behaviour and impact, the function of most of the predicted surface and secreted proteins remains unknown.In the past decade, the extracellular proteomes of several Gram-positive bacteria have been analyzed using proteomics approaches. Many of these studies employed some kind of protein extraction methods from culture supernatants and/or cell wall fractions followed by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry-based protein identification (e.g. [14-18]). Recently, more direct and rapid methods for the ""in situ"" identification of surface proteins have been developed which are based on ""shaving"" the surface of intact bacteria with proteolytic enzymes, followed by identification of the released peptides by liquid chromatography (LC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) [19]. An advantage of this approach is that the proteolytic enzymes will only have access to proteins that are exposed on the surface of the bacterial cell, which could limit contamination with intracellular proteins. This approach should in principle be biased towards proteins that are of particular importance for bacterial interactions with the environment. Indeed, the ""shaving"" approach has been applied successfully in the search for new bacterial epitopes. In a landmark study, Rodriguez-Ortega et al [19] identified in total 72 proteins in Streptococcus pyogenes M1_SF370 by shaving the bacterial surface with trypsin or proteinase K. The identified proteins included known protective antigens and also revealed new promising candidate antigens for vaccine development.In the present study, we have applied the ""shaving"" approach to identify the surface proteome of E. faecalis V583. Cells were treated with free trypsin or trypsin anchored to agarose beads to shave off and digest surface-exposed proteins. Using a combination of experiments, 69 surface-located proteins were identified, including proteins assumed to be involved in pathogenicity and several proteins with unknown function. We also identified proteins that are thought to be cytoplasmic, but which tend to be found at bacterial surfaces too. We discuss the putative roles and relevance of several of the identified proteins and we compare the various approaches. The results provide a basis for the identification and further study of novel proteins putatively involved in pathogenicity and adaptability of E. faecalis V583.Overnight cultures of E. feacalis V583 [5] were diluted in fresh prewarmed brain heart infusion (BHI) medium (Oxoid Ltd., Hampshire, England) to an OD600~0.2 and incubated at 37°C without agitation. The bacteria were harvested on the transition between late exponential and stationary phase (OD600~1.7) by centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min, 4°C). The cell pellet from 100 ml of culture was washed three times with 10 ml PBS by centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min, 4°C) and subsequently resuspended in PBS containing 40% sucrose. Three different shaving reactions were set-up, all containing 5 mM DTT and all with the same final concentration of cells: (1) addition of 20 μg trypsin (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), (2) addition of trypsin-agarose (100 units; Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), or (3) no addition of trypsin (untreated). The samples were incubated for 1 or 2 hours at 37°C with shaking at 300 rpm. After incubation the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3000 × g, 10 min) and the supernatants were collected for further protein digestion with 1 μg freshly added trypsin over night (16-18 h) at 37°C with agitation at 400 rpm. Cell samples taken before (i.e. after resuspending in PBS) and after the different enzymatic treatments were used to test cell viability by plating appropriate dilutions on BHI agar plates and counting of colony forming units (CFU). The overnight trypsin digestion of the supernatants was stopped by adding formic acid to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v). Prior to nanoLC-MS/MS analysis, peptides were concentrated and purified in two steps using C18 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) in the first step and C18 StageTips [20] in the second step. For each treatment, samples from four biological replicates were analysed.Reverse phase (C18) nano online liquid chromatographic MS/MS analyses of tryptic peptides were performed using a HPLC system consisting of two Agilent 1200 HPLC binary pumps (nano and capillary) with corresponding autosampler, column heater and integrated switching valve. This LC system was coupled via a nanoelectrospray ion source to a LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). For the analyses, the peptide solution was injected onto the 5 × 0.3-mm extraction column filled with Zorbax 300 SB-C18 of 5-μm particle size (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). Samples were washed with a mobile phase consisting of 97% 0.1% formic acid & 3% acetonitrile. The flow rate of 4 μl/min provided by the capillary pump. After 7 min, the switching valve of the integrated switching valve was activated, and the peptides were eluted in the back-flush mode from the extraction column onto a 150 × 0.075-mm C18, 3-μm resin, column (GlycproSIL C18-80Å, Glycpromass, Stove, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and MS grade water, both containing 0.1% formic acid. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a binary gradient from 5 to 55% of acetonitrile in 120 min. The flow rate of 0.2 μl min-1 was provided by the nanoflow pump.Mass spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode applying a data-dependent automatic switch between survey scan and tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) acquisition. Peptide samples were analyzed by collision induced dissociation (CID) in the LTQ ion trap by acquiring one Orbitrap survey scan in the mass range of m/z 380-2000 followed by CID of the six most intense ions in the ion trap. The target value in the LTQ-Orbitrap was 1,000,000 for survey scan at a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400 using lock masses for recalibration to improve the mass accuracy of precursor ions. Fragmentation was performed with a target value of 5,000 ions. The ion selection threshold was 500 counts. Selected sequenced ions were dynamically excluded for 180 s.Mass spectrometric data were first analyzed by generating msf files from raw MS and MS/MS spectra using the Proteome Discoverer 1.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the database searches were then performed with an in house maintained E. faecalis V583 protein sequence database, using the SEQUEST search engine. The following criteria were applied; database decoy, true; Enzyme name, trypsin (full); Missed cleavage sites, 2; Precursor mass tolerance, 10 ppm; fragment mass tolerance: 0.6 Da; dynamic modifications: N-term acetyl (any N-terminus), oxidation (M), carboxymethyl (C), deamidated (N, Q). Proteins were considered as significant hits if the following conditions were met: XCorr higher than 2.0; false discovery rate less than 5%; identified by at least two different peptides; identified in at least two of the independent parallels by at least one peptide in each.To visualize proteins or protein fragments that were resistant to trypsin, 20 μl of the supernatant from the over-night trypsination were applied to 10% NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Only samples after two-hour incubation were studied. The gels were stained using SilverSNAP Stain for Mass Spectrometry (Pierce, Rockford, IL) following the manufacturer's procedure. After the silver staining, the gel-lane was sliced into 12 pieces, and destained using the protocol included in SilverSNAP Stain for Mass Spectrometry kit. Each gel piece was then incubated with 0.1 μg trypsin in 25 μl 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, over night at 37°C and 400 rpm. The trypsin reactions were stopped by adding 0.1% formic acid. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes, and the rest of the peptides were extracted from the gel pieces by incubating with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 60% (v/v) acetonitrile, at 37°C, 400 rpm for 10 min. The extracts from three gel-pieces were pooled together (giving four samples from each treatment). The peptides were dried in a speed-vac, and rehydrated in 30 μl 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The peptide samples were desalted using C18 stage tips [20] prior to nanoLC-MS/MS. Proteins were considered as significant hits if the following conditions were met: XCorr higher than 2.0; false discovery rate less than 5%; identified by at least two different peptides; identified in at least one of the three samples from each treatment.Protein sequences used for in computo analysis of the localization of the identified proteins were extracted from the LocateP database [12] and analyzed using several bioinformatic tools. Putative N-terminal signal sequences and cleavage sites were predicted using the Signal P 3.0 server [21] and LipoP v 1.0 [22]. The TMHMM Server v. 2.0 [23] was used to predict proteins with multiple transmembrane helices or N-terminal transmembrane anchors. Proteins with features indicating non-classical secretion were predicted using the SecretomeP 2.0 Server [24]. Domain annotations were done using Pfam [25]. After these verifications, the predicted localizations for 62 of the 69 proteins discussed below correspond to those given in the LocateP database (updated March 10, 2010). For seven proteins, we reached a different conclusion than LocateP, as described in results and discussion.Before carrying out the experiments, we performed extensive tests to find optimal conditions for the trypsin treatment. Most importantly, we checked the effect of incubation time (30 min to 24 hours) on cell viability. Incubation times of 2 hours or less did not lead to significant reductions in the CFU number (Additional file 1), whereas longer incubation times led to decreased viability (data not shown). Based on these observations, incubation times were set to one or two hours. Two hour incubations led to a higher number of identified proteins (Additional file 2). Generally, the longer incubations did not lead to an increase in the fraction of cytoplasmic proteins, confirming the absence of cell lysis during the enzymatic treatment (Additional file 2).Intact bacterial cells were harvested and treated with either trypsin or trypsin beads (trypsin bound to agarose beads) for one or two hours. Because trypsin beads are less likely to penetrate the cell wall than free trypsin, they are more likely to only act on proteins that protrude from the cell wall. As a control, cells were incubated for one or two hours without adding trypsin. Direct analysis of released tryptic peptides led to the identification of 57 unique proteins (Table ​(Table1).1). Subsequent analysis of solubilized proteins and large protein fragments using SDS-PAGE followed by MS-based identification (Figure ​(Figure1;1; see Materials and Methods) led to the identification of another 12 unique proteins (Table ​(Table2).2). The sequences of all identified proteins were analysed using a variety of bioinformatic tools (LocateP, SignalP, Pfam, LipoP, pSORT and TMHMM) to verify or (for EF2860, EF0071, EF0123, EF0164, EF0394, EF0417 & EF_B0004) to adjust the localization given in the LocateP database. The results are incorporated in Table ​Table11 &2 and are discussed in appropriate sections, below.Proteins identified by LC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic fragments obtained after different treatments of intact E. faecalis V583.Further details on the Sequest-based protein identification process are provided in the Materials and Methods section and in Table S5 (Additional file 4).aSignificant hits (or absence thereof, indicated by -) obtained after searches in Pfam [25] for putative and hypothetical proteins.bAll data extracted from the LocateP database [12] with two exceptions: EF1033 (annotated as 6-aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer hydrolase; annotated as putative, in LocateP) and EF2860 annotated as ErfK/YbiS/YcfS/YnhG family protein; annotated as putative, in LocateP).cPredicted localization and potential cleavage site.

See text for references.Analysis with Signal P 3.0 [21] suggested the presence of a signal peptidase I (SPase I) cleavage site in ten of the identified proteins. Four of these proteins contained a putative C-terminal LPxTG motif, whereas one additional protein (EF2860) is likely to be cell-wall anchored because it contains a putative peptidoglycan binding domain (Pfam PF12229). It should be noted that the sequences deposited in the GenBank database for two of the four LPxTG-containing proteins (EF1033 and EF2713) lack a predicted N-terminal signal sequence. A closer look at the upstream sequences showed that the start codons probably are located 72 and 96 nucleotides upstream of the start codon suggested in the GenBank entries, for EF1033 and EF2713, respectively (Additional file 3). After this N-terminal ""extension"" SignalP and LipoP detected a putative SPase I cleavage site in both sequences.Table ​Table33 gives an overview over the predicted localizations of the 69 identified unique proteins and shows that the methods yielded a strong bias towards identifying proteins that are predicted to be covalently anchored to the cell wall or to carry lipid anchors. Several proteins were identified in more than one experiment and an overview is provided in Figure ​Figure2.2. Treatment with free trypsin yielded 58 proteins and treatment with trypsin beads yielded 29 proteins. Analysis of samples from untreated cells yielded 16 proteins. More detailed information concerning the numbers of proteins identified after the various treatments is provided in additional file 2. Details of the proteomic analysis are provided in Additional file 4 and Additional file 5 containing Tables S5 and S6, respectively.Summary of the identified proteins grouped according to predicted localization.a Localization data are from LocateP (Zhou et al., 2008), with the seven corrections described in the text. According to Locate P, the numbers of identified cytoplasmic, lipid anchor, N-terminal anchor, cell wall associated and secreted proteins.b Data from the LocateP database.c Containing multiple transmembrane helices.d Not detected (ND), LocateP only predicts cell wall proteins with LPxTG motifs.Overview over the identifcation of 69 surface-located proteins using various treatments of enterococcal cells. The putative cellular localizations of the identified proteins, as provided in Table ​Table33 are indicated. In total 58, 16 and 29 proteins were identified in the trypsin, untreated and beads samples, respectively. Note that this figure combines the data from the one and two hour treatments and includes the data from both the direct LC-MS/MS analysis and the SDS-PAGE-based approach. More details about the numbers of identified proteins in the various experiments are provided in Additional file 2. Proteins containing multiple transmembrane helices are indicated by ""Membrane""; proteins indicated by ""Cell Wall"" include 4 proteins with LPxTG anchors and two proteins containing domains known to display cell wall binding affinity.The number of proteins only identified after a ""shaving"" treatment amounted to 53. Nine of these were only found after treatment with trypsin beads, 38 were only found after treatment with free trypsin and six were found after both treatments (Figure ​(Figure2).2). The 15 proteins identified with only trypsin-beads or with both trypsin and trypsin beads are likely to be exposed on the surface of the cell wall, whereas the 38 unique proteins found in the free trypsin samples fraction are probably localized deeper in the cell wall.Of the 16 proteins identified from untreated cells, 12 were identified in all three treatments (Figure ​(Figure2).2). While three of these are predicted to be secreted and one (EF0201) is probably cytoplasmic, the others are predicted to be attached to the bacterial surface through an anchor (five lipo-anchors and one LPxTG anchor) or cell wall binding domain (one, EF2860) or even as integral membrane protein (one, EF1264). The trypsin-independent release of these proteins may be a result of natural shedding, a phenomenon that indeed has been observed previously, in particular for lipoproteins [15,26]. According to a TMHMM topology prediction EF1264, annotated as membrane protein, contains five N-terminal transmembrane helices and a huge extracellular domain with putative sulfatase activity of 523 residues (starting at amino acid 179). EF1264 was identified by many significant peptide hits spread over all treatments. Figure ​Figure33 shows that all identified peptides stem from the extracellular domain and that there is a 115 amino acid gap between the predicted integral membrane domain and the first identified tryptic fragment. Perhaps the extracellular domain is shedded after natural cleavage of EF1264. It is conceivable that such (apparently rather abundant) shedding is a physiologically relevant phenomenon since the sulfatase may remove sulphate from mucin, which would allow more easy degradation of mucin by glycosidases [27] and perhaps also could facilitate bacterial adhesion.Amino acid sequence and predicted topology of EF1264. The predicted trans-memberane helices (TMH) and the identified tryptic peptides after different treatments are mapped on the sequence, using the color coding indicated in the figure.According to the LocateP database 34 of the 69 identified proteins lack an N-terminal signal sequence and are therefore predicted to be cytoplasmic proteins. All these proteins were analysed using PSORTb v.3.0 [28] and the SecretomeP (SecP) 2.0 Server [24,29]. SecP predict proteins that are putatively secreted without having a detectable N-terminal signal sequence, i.e. by ""non-classical secretion"". Analysis with SecP indicated that four of the proteins predicted to be cytoplasmic (EF0970, EF1523, EF2718 and EF_B0004) may follow non-classical secretion. PSORTb predicted EF_B0004 (TraC protein) to be a cell wall protein and Pfam gave a significant hit against ""Bacterial extracellular solute-binding proteins, family 5"" (PF00496). It has been shown that TraC proteins play a role as surface pheromone receptor and are thereby involved in the regulation of the conjugation process [30,31]. Therefore, EF_B0004 was classified as a cell wall protein in this study. The other three proteins were retained as cytoplasmic, despite the fact that PSORTb predicted EF0970 (ribosomal protein L27) to have an extracellular location.Identification of cytoplasmic proteins at extracellular locations is not unusual and at least 20 of the 33 proteins found in this study have been identified in previous studies of the secretomes or surface proteomes of Gram-positive bacteria (Tables ​(Tables11 and ​and2)2) [13,18,26,32-36]. The majority of the identified cytoplasmic proteins were unique to the trypsin fraction and/or the beads fraction, indicating that these proteins bind to the cell envelope and need to be ""shaved"" from the surface, despite the lack of known binding motifs or domains. Many of the identified cytoplasmic proteins are highly abundant proteins like ribosomal proteins (Rbps; more than 20% of all identified proteins), EF-Tu/G, GADPH and chaperones, which suggests that cell lysis rather than an unknown active secretion process determines their extracellular presence. While the cell viability checks described above indicate that cell lysis due to the trypsin treatment is unlikely, it is conceivable that cell lysis in the cell culture prior to the trypsin treatment may have released intracellular proteins that somehow have re-associated with the cell envelope and escaped proteolytic degradation [26,37].While cytoplasmic proteins found in studies such as the present generally must be considered contaminants, there have been speculations in the literature that some of these actually may have extracellular functions. One example is Rbp L7/L12 (EF2715) which has been identified at the surface of several Gram positive bacteria [19,26,34,35,38]. We found Rbp L7/L12 in the beads fraction only and this implies an exposed localization, similar to the localization suggested in B. subtilis [26]. Bacterial Rbp L7/L12 has immunogenic properties in humans [38,39] and is being explored as candidate antigen for vaccine purposes [40,41]. Recent data showed that exposure of bacterial Rbp L7/L12 is a risk factor for colorectal cancer and stimulates progression of adenomas into carcinomas [42]. There has also been some speculation about possible adhesive roles of extracellular EF-Tu, DnaK, enolase and GAPDH, all identified in the present study and in a recent study of the laboratory strain Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 [13], since these proteins bind strongly to human plasminogen [32].Proteins were annotated as being secreted to the culture medium if the bioinformatic analyses showed the presence of a SPaseI cleavage site and did not reveal any sequence or domain known to be involved in covalent or non-covalent binding to the cell wall. Only five such proteins were identified indicating that few secreted proteins are closely associated to the microbe. Three of the secreted proteins (EF0123, EF0394, EF0417) are annotated as N-terminally anchored in the LocateP database. It is, however, not easy to differentiate between secreted proteins with processed signal peptides and proteins that retain their signal peptides as N-terminal membrane anchors [12]. The Signal P server predicted all three proteins to contain a unique cleavage site, when using both algorithms in the program. All three were detected even without trypsin treatment, suggesting a loose association with the cell envelope. Taken together, we conclude that EF0123, EF0394 and EF0417 are secreted proteins.EF2174 was detected after trypsin treatment only and putatively encodes a glycoside hydrolase belonging to family GH25 [43]. This family comprises enzymes with lysozyme activity that are thought to be involved in peptidoglycan remodelling during cell division [44].The well known secreted metalloprotease coccolysin, a gelatinase (EF1818; GelE) was identified after all treatments (Table ​(Table1),1), indicating that GelE is loosely associated to the cell surface. Coccolysin is known to be associated with virulence and is capable of degrading cellular tissues during infection, cleaving substrates such as haemoglobin, collagen and fibrin [45,46]. There are also indications that GelE is required for biofilm formation [47].Among the 31 non-secreted non-cytoplasmic proteins found in this study (Table ​(Table3),3), three are annotated as integral membrane proteins. We identified only 0.5% of the predicted transmembrane proteins in the genome of E. faecalis V583 (Table ​(Table3).3). Such low numbers of identified transmembrane proteins are not unusual [19,26,37,48] and are likely to be due to limited accessibility of the proteins and/or a limited ability of trypsin to penetrate the cell wall. One of these transmembrane proteins, the sulfatase (EF1264), was detected by many peptides after all treatments (see above and Figure ​Figure3).3). The other two were only detected after trypsin treatment and only by a minimal number of peptides. EF0502 is a 781-residue hypothetical protein which according to topology predictions contains several extracellular domains. Both detected peptides are predicted to have an extracellular location. EF3257 is a 648-residue oxidoreductase belonging to the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide family with probably only two trans-membrane helices and a large extracellular domain. Both detected peptides stem from extracellular domains.Five identified proteins are thought to be N-terminally anchored to the cell membrane via a Sec-type signal peptide that is not cleaved off during secretion. Relatively few such proteins were identified (Table ​(Table3),3), suggesting that they are expressed at low levels or that they generally have low accessibility for trypsin. Among these proteins are two penicillin-binding proteins (EF2857 & EF0991), one amidase (EF0737) and one protein of unknown function (EF1319). EF2857 and EF0991 are class B penicillin binding proteins (PBP), which are transpeptidases involved in the final stage of cell wall synthesis [49]. E. faecalis has three class B PBPs that have low affinity for β-lactams and can take over the transpeptidase activity of more high affinity PBPs when these are inhibited by antibiotics [50]. We also identified a L,D-transpeptidase (EF2860; YkuD domain), in all treatments and with a high number of peptide hits, indicating that this protein is abundant at the surface of V583. Studies on E. faecium have indicated that L,D-transpeptidase activity may represent another way to bypass inhibition of PBPs [51,52].The fifth protein, DltD (EF2746), is also involved in the biosynthesis of surface structures. The dltD gene is part of an operon consisting four genes (dltA-dltD) whose gene products are all necessary to incorporate D-alanyl residues into lipoteichoic acids (LTA) [53,54]. It has previously been shown that disruption of genes in the dlt operon of E. faecalis lead to diminished adhesion to eukaryotic cells and less biofilm formation, indicating that the dlt operon is involved in pathogenicity [55]. Interestingly, it is not fully established whether the N-terminal anchor tethers DltD to the inner or outer leaflet of the membrane [53,56]. The fact that DltD was detected after all types of treatments may be taken to suggest that the protein is attached to the outer leaflet, as one would expect for proteins using a Sec-type signal peptide as membrane anchor.Of the four proteins containing a putative LPxTG anchor, two (EF2224 & EF2713) have unknown functions. EF2713 is up-regulated when E. faecalis V583 is grown in the presence of blood [57], indicating a putative role of this protein in infection processes. The LPxTG anchor protein EF2224 contains five copies of a so-called DUF11 repeat with unknown function and is a putative member of the MSCRAMM (mirobial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) family of proteins [58]. These proteins contain tandemly repeated immunoglobulin-like folds as observed for staphylococcal adhesins. The E. faecalis V583 genome contains seventeen proteins belonging to the MSCRAMM family [59]. Interestingly, EF2224 is highly expressed during the infection process in humans [59].The LPxTG anchor protein EF1033 is a lipoamidase (Lpa) cleaving lipoic acids from lipoylated molecules [60,61]. EF1033 was only detected after trypsin treatment, indicative of covalent cell wall attachment. Lipoic acid is an essential sulphur containing cofactor of several enzymes. Interestingly, so far, E. faecalis is the only bacterial species in which Lpa activity has been detected [61]. Jiang and Cronan [61] speculate that the Lpa is a cytoplasmic salvage enzyme, but our experimental and bioinformatic results indicate that the enzyme is a cell wall anchored protein. Most likely, Lpa recruits its substrates from the environment, such as the GI tract.The fourth LPxTG protein is the plasmid encoded surface exclusion factor Sea1 (EFA0052) which is involved in the regulation of sex pheromone-controlled conjugation [62].EF2860 is linked to the cell wall by a peptidoglucan binding domain and encodes a cell wall modifying transpeptidase homologous with YkuD from Bacillus subtilis. This protein was found after all three treatments and identified with relatively many peptide hits (Table ​(Table1),1), indicating that EF2860 is abundant on the surface and may show a relatively large extent of shedding. This protein may contribute to the antibiotic resistance of E. faecalis, as discussed above.The most populated group of proteins identified in this study are the lipoproteins, of which 17 were detected, representing 23% of the lipoproteins putatively encoded on the E. faecalis genome (Table ​(Table3).3). Twelve of these were detected only after a ""shaving"" treatment. Seven of the detected lipoproteins are proteins with no predicted function. Two of these unknown lipoproteins (EF0176 & EF0177) are located on the same operon, share 70% sequence identity, and contain a ""Basic membrane protein"" domain (PF02608) belonging to Clan CL0144 in the Pfam database. This clan consists of proteins that are involved in chemotaxis and membrane transport of sugars as well as outer membrane proteins that are known for their antigenicity in pathogenic bacteria. Both proteins are homologous with a CD4+ T-cell-stimulating antigen in Listeria [63]. One of the other proteins with unknown function, EF0164, is annotated as N-terminally anchored in the LocateP database, but is classified as a lipoanchored protein on the basis of our analyses with LipoP.Of the ten lipoproteins with predicted functions, four lipoproteins resemble the substrate-binding domains of multi-component ABC transporters for the import of peptides (EF0907, EF3106) or sugars (EF2221, EF2903). Three proteins (EF3041, EF3256, EFA0003) are involved in pheromone-regulated processes that include conjugation [31], adding to the two cell wall associated proteins involved in these processes that are discussed above (EFB0004 & EFA0052). EF0071 seems to encode a glycoside hydrolase belonging to clan GH-G in the CAZy database. The protein is classified as N-terminally anchored in the LocateP database, but our analyses with the LipoP program clearly indicated that EF0071 is a lipoanchored protein. EF0685 belongs to the rotamase family and is thus likely to be involved in extracellular protein folding, possibly by exerting prolyl-peptidyl isomerase activity.The final lipo-anchored protein is EF2556, fumarate reductase, which was detected by remarkably large numbers of peptides after all treatments (Table ​(Table1).1). E. faecalis is one of few bacteria that produces substantial amounts of extracellular superoxide. Fumarate reductase is likely to be involved in superoxide production and may thus be an important source of oxidative stress for the host [64]. It has been demonstrated that the superoxide from E. faecalis promotes chromosomal instability in mammalian cells and that this can lead to colorectal cancer [65,66].In recent years, several analyses of bacterial surface proteomes have been described. Despite the improvements in the mass spectrometry methods, the numbers of identified proteins are normally in the order of 30 - 80, meaning that only a minority of the putative surface-located proteins is being found. In this type of studies, it is common to find a significant fraction of proteins that are thought to be cytoplasmic and there is some evidence that this is not just the result from artefacts such as cell lysis. We show that the large majority of the identified cytoplasmic proteins are only found after treatment with trypsin. This is an important observation, since it shows that these proteins bind tightly to the cell envelope.In a recent published proteomics-based analysis 38 proteins were identified on the surface of E. faecalis JH2-2 [13]. Seventeen of these proteins were found after using a method similar to the one used here (i.e. surface shaving with trypsin) and seven of these were also found in the present study (EF0177, EF0201, EF0907, EF1613, EF1964, EF2556 and EF3256). Disparities between this type of studies may be due to many factors, e.g. differences between the strains and growth conditions or differences in the confidence of protein identification. Benachour et al [13] allowed protein identification on the basis of only one peptide hit, while we required at least two peptides for confident identification. Large inter-strain variation has been observed in several previous studies, both for secreted proteins and for proteins detected by a trypsin-shaving approach [34,67,68].In conclusion, our studies reveal 69 surface-located proteins in E. faecalis V583 with varying roles in bacterial behaviour. Several of the identified proteins are involved in cell wall synthesis and maintenance as well as in cell-cell communication and seem interesting targets for drug design. We detected only a few proteins with known or conceivable functions in adhesion, but such proteins may be among the many identified proteins with unknown function. Clearly, the identified proteins with unknown function stand out as targets for more in-depth investigations and several of these are currently subjected to knock-out studies in our laboratory.LAB, GM, TR and VE developed the initial concept for this study.

PMC3062213,Golgi Glycosylation,False,"Glycosylation is a very common modification of protein and lipid, and most glycosylation reactions occur in the Golgi. Although the transfer of initial sugar(s) to glycoproteins or glycolipids occurs in the ER or on the ER membrane, the subsequent addition of the many different sugars that make up a mature glycan is accomplished in the Golgi. Golgi membranes are studded with glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, and nucleotide sugar transporters arrayed in a generally ordered manner from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), such that each activity is able to act on specific substrate(s) generated earlier in the pathway. The spectrum of glycosyltransferases and other activities that effect glycosylation may vary with cell type, and thus the final complement of glycans on glycoconjugates is variable. In addition, glycan synthesis is affected by Golgi pH, the integrity of Golgi peripheral membrane proteins, growth factor signaling, Golgi membrane dynamics, and cellular stress. Knowledge of Golgi glycosylation has fostered the development of assays to identify mechanisms of intracellular vesicular trafficking and facilitated glycosylation engineering of recombinant glycoproteins.The Golgi is home to a multitude of glycosyltransferases (GTs), glycosidases, and nucleotide sugar transporters that function together to complete the synthesis of glycans from founding sugars covalently attached to protein or lipid in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Fig. 1, sugars shaded in green). Thus, glycoproteins, glycosphingolipids (GSLs), proteoglycans, and glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors acquire their final sugar complement during passage through the Golgi. Most glycoproteins and proteoglycans are either secreted from the cell, or span the plasma membrane with their glycans becoming the molecular frontier of the cell (Fig. 1). GSLs and GPI-anchored proteins also reside in the plasma membrane, the latter being confined to the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer. The forest of glycans at the cell surface is often called the glycocalyx and can be visualized by electron microscopy after staining for sugars.Glycans that mature in the Golgi. The diagram depicts simple N- and O-glycans attached to glycoproteins, proteoglycans, glycosphingolipids, and a GPI anchor in the plasma membrane. Rather rare O-glycans are found attached to EGF-like repeats (EGF; pink) or thrombospondin repeats (TSR; gray) with a particular consensus sequence. The WxxW motif in a TSR is C-mannosylated. Core regions boxed in teal are sugars added in the ER. The remaining sugars in each class of glycan are added during passage through the cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi network (TGN) compartments of the Golgi. Abbreviations are: Man, mannose; Gal, galactose; Glc, glucose; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; GlcNH2, Glucosamine; GlcA, glucuronic acid; IdoA, iduronic acid; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; Xyl, xylose; Fuc, Fucose; Sia, sialic acid; 3S, 3-O-sulfated; 6S, 6-O-sulfated, PO4−, phosphate. (Modified from Figure 1.6 in Essentials of glycobiology, with permission from Varki and Sharon 2009.)Glycosylation is the most common posttranslational modification of proteins. Mature glycans at any one glycosylation site may be as simple as a single sugar, or as complex as a polymer of more than 200 sugars, potentially modified with phosphate, sulfate, acetate, or phosphorylcholine. Most importantly, glycans are often branched. For example, a complex N-glycan (Fig. 1) may have up to six branches or antennae, and each antenna may contain many repeating disaccharide units. This article will describe the nature of resident Golgi GTs and other activities involved in Golgi glycosylation from entry into the cis-Golgi through passage to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The focus is on mammalian Golgi glycosylation but comparisons with yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila are made where appropriate.In mammals, there are more than 250 GTs that reside in the Golgi where they catalyze the transfer of one sugar to another sugar on a glycan acceptor, generally covalently attached to protein or lipid. GTs are grouped into families of related catalytic or sequence activity in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (CAZy) (Cantarel et al. 2009). There are, for example, 20 mammalian sialyltransferases (Takashima 2008). By contrast, Drosophila has a single sialyltransferase (Koles et al. 2004), and yeast have none. Most GTs transfer a single sugar to an acceptor but there are a few GTs that catalyze the transfer of two different sugars, typically to generate a polymer of repeating units, as in proteoglycans (Fig. 1). The Golgi GT is a type II transmembrane protein with a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail in the cytosol, a transmembrane domain, a stalk-like stem region, and a globular catalytic domain in the Golgi lumen (Fig. 2). Some GTs contain two functional domains. For example, several polypeptide GalNAcTs have a lectin domain that binds to GalNAc and a catalytic domain that transfers GalNAc (Hassan et al. 2000; Fritz et al. 2006); a family of N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferases are important in heparan sulfate biosynthesis (Aikawa et al. 2001); and the putative glycosyltransferase Large has two glycosyltransferase domains (Longman et al. 2003; Aguilan et al. 2009). GTs are often glycosylated by other GTs or, in some cases, by autocatalytic transferase activity. The glycans on some GTs are required for their correct folding during synthesis, and these GTs often lack catalytic activity when generated in bacteria. Interestingly, many GTs are cleaved in their stem region by proteases in the Golgi and secreted from the cell (Shifley and Cole 2008; Kitazume et al. 2009). This may be a mechanism to regulate their activity in the Golgi, or to allow them to act at the cell surface or in the extracellular environment. The latter would require nucleotide sugars to be available outside the cell. Intriguingly, nucleotide sugar transporters of the Golgi have been found to facilitate nucleotide sugar release from the cell (Sesma et al. 2009).Glycosyltransferases and nucleotide sugar transporters of the Golgi. The diagram depicts a variety of nucleotide sugar transporters that transfer a nucleotide sugar from the cytoplasm into the Golgi lumen in exchange for a nucleotide monophosphate generated by hydrolysis of the nucleotide diphosphate released after transfer of the sugar to an acceptor. A typical type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase (a sialyltransferase; gray) with its short cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane domain, extended stem region, and globular catalytic domain is shown binding CMP-Sia from which it transfers Sia to Gal on a complex N-glycan on a glycoprotein (green). Abbreviations are defined in the legend to Figure 1. (Modified from Figure 4.4 in Essentials of glycobiology, with permission from Freeze and Elbein 2009.)The general reaction catalyzed by a Golgi GT is shown for a sialyltransferase (SiaT) in Figure 2. The sugar transferred by each GT comes from a high energy nucleotide sugar which is synthesized in the cytoplasm (or nucleus in the case of CMP-Sia), and must be imported into the Golgi lumen. This is achieved by nucleotide sugar transporters (Berninsone and Hirschberg 2000), families of multitransmembrane transporters (Cantarel et al. 2009) that reside throughout the compartments of the Golgi (Fig. 2). Importantly, mammals do not have a GDP-Man transporter but use Dolichol-P-Man as the donor for the transfer of core Man residues in the ER (Fig. 1, green shaded Man residues). Nucleotide sugar transport is driven by reverse transport of the monophosphate nucleotide generated by Golgi resident pyrophosphorylases that hydrolyse the released nucleotide diphosphate following sugar transfer (Berninsone and Hirschberg 2000). The addition of each sugar creates the substrate or acceptor of the next GT. Many glycosyltransferases require a metal ion to optimize catalysis. In the case of N-glycans linked via Asn to protein, the acceptor substrate is often a specifically branched glycan with a particular sugar composition (Stanley et al. 2009). Each sugar within a glycan may be substituted with another sugar at any carbon with a free hydroxyl group, and thus branched antennae are a feature of many glycans (Fig. 1). The specificity of each GT is defined not only by the sugar it transfers but also by the sugar transferred to and the glycosidic linkage formed. In fact, sequence comparisons group GTs based on the glycosidic linkage catalysed rather than the sugar transferred (Oriol et al. 1999).Each Golgi GT transfers a sugar to a specific acceptor generated by preceding GTs, and must act at a particular stage in the glycosylation pathway. Thus, Golgi GTs must be appropriately localized in the cis-, medial-, trans-Golgi, or the TGN. This does not mean that a GT needs to be strictly confined to one Golgi compartment. In fact, Golgi GTs cycle from the Golgi to the ER, and at any time, a small proportion of those GTs tested have been found in the ER (Rhee et al. 2005). Nevertheless, an appropriate proportion of the enzyme population must be in the right place for a sufficient amount of time to act on glycoconjugates carrying the appropriate substrate. The factors that localize Golgi GTs to a particular compartment of the Golgi include sequence motifs located in the cytosolic domain, the transmembrane domain and/or the stem region, sometimes leading to oligomerization as shown for the sialyltransferase in Figure 2 (Colley et al. 1992; Fenteany and Colley 2005). Enzymes that act sequentially in a glycosylation pathway may also be found in a complex. For example, GlcNAcT-I, the GT that initiates the synthesis of complex N-glycans, interacts with α-mannosidase II, which removes two Man residues, and GlcNAcT-II which acts next in the pathway, by a mechanism termed kin recognition (Nilsson et al. 1993b, 1994, 1996; Opat et al. 2000). Golgi GTs generally have a shorter transmembrane domain than glycoproteins that span the plasma membrane, and this is proposed to promote retention of GTs in the Golgi (Munro 1995). In some cases, a Golgi GT associates with another protein, which is important for Golgi localization or transferase activity. For example, T-synthase must be synthesized together with the chaperone COSMC to acquire activity, and the complex constitutes the active enzyme in the Golgi (Ju and Cummings 2002; Aryal et al. 2010). The Drosophila protein pipe is similar to mammalian enzymes that modify glycosaminoglycans, and requires another protein termed “windbeutel” to localize to the Golgi (Sen et al. 2000). A glycoprotein inhibitor of complex and hybrid N-glycan synthesis (GnT1IP) forms a complex with GlcNAcT-I, α-mannosidase IIX and/or GlcNAcT-III, but inhibits the enzyme activity of only GlcNAcT-I (Huang and Stanley 2010). An extensive discussion of the mechanisms of Golgi resident protein retention and compartmental localization is presented in Banfield 2011.The diagram in Figure 3 depicts which sugars are added by glycosyltransferases, may be removed by glycosidases, or modified by epimerases and sulfotransferases in the different Golgi compartments. The compartments are shown as overlapping to denote the anterograde and retrograde vesicular trafficking of Golgi GTs known to occur. Because of the dynamic and competitive nature of Golgi glycan synthesis, glycans on a mature glycoconjugate are a heterogeneous collection, even at a single glycosylation site. An immature glycan may be a substrate for many different GTs that compete, and a glycoconjugate may transit a Golgi compartment too quickly to be acted on by all GTs capable of using it as a substrate. Thus, a purified glycoprotein population will include many glycoforms and these may vary in functional activity. Nevertheless, in this sea of heterogeneity, there often exists a strategically placed glycan whose precise structure is the key to a biological activity of the molecule, as in the case of the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL-1) (Somers et al. 2000). In PSGL-1, an amino-terminal core 2 O-glycan with a sialylated Lewis X glycan determinant and adjacent sulfated tyrosine(s) are required for the binding of PSGL-1 by P-selectin (Xia et al. 2003). The related L-selectin binds ligands with a sialylated Lewis X determinant that is sulfated (Hiraoka et al. 1999, 2004).Compartmentalization of sugar addition and removal in the Golgi. Although Golgi membranes are dynamically recycling, compartments corresponding to cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi and the TGN are identified by resident proteins that mostly localize to a particular compartment (Nilsson et al. 1993a; Rabouille et al. 1995). The diagram shows in which Golgi compartment particular sugars are added or generated (green) or may be removed (red). Compartments are shown overlapping to signify that distinctions are not precise. Sugars added in the ER or ERGIC compartments before the cis-Golgi are boxed in teal in Figure 1. Abbreviations are defined in the legend to Figure 1.Sulfation of specific OH and NH2 groups on sugars is a very important feature of proteoglycans (Selleck 2000; Fig. 1). Phosphorylation is required on high mannose N-glycans of lysosomal hydrolases for them to be recognized by mannose-6-phosphate receptors and routed to lysosomes (Kornfeld 1990; Fig. 1). Therefore, the glycans that emerge from the TGN may be quite simple or extremely complex with several branches that contain linear polymeric chains of sugars modified by sulfate, phosphate, or potentially other moieties. For example, in C. elegans some glycans contain phosphorylcholine (Cipollo et al. 2005). In additon, a glycoprotein often carries glycans of many different types. Thus, GPI-anchored proteins usually possess N- and/or O-glycans, glycoproteins may carry one or more glycosaminoglycan chains, proteoglycans may carry N- and O-glycans, and molecules with EGF-like (EGF) or thrombospondin (TSR) repeats may carry many different classes of glycan (Fig. 1). For example, Notch1 has 36 EGF repeats, some of which may carry O-fucose-, O-glucose- and O-GlcNAc glycans, and an N-glycan (Stanley and Okajima 2010).Glycoproteins that are N-glycosylated arrive in the cis-Golgi carrying N-glycans added cotranslationally in the ER (Kelleher and Gilmore 2006) to a proportion of their Asn-X (not Pro)-Ser/Thr (rarely Cys) sites (Zielinska et al. 2010). The consensus motif for N-glycosylation is necessary but not sufficient for N-glycosylation to occur. The N-glycans on glycoproteins in the cis-Golgi are of the high mannose type and usually contain eight or nine mannose (Man) residues (Stanley et al. 2009). These may remain unchanged during passage through the Golgi and be present on cell surface or secreted glycoproteins (Fig. 1). However, N-glycans are often processed in the Golgi, initially in the cis-Golgi by a set of α-mannosidases that remove Man residues to generate the Man5GlcNAc2Asn intermediate which is the substrate of the medial Golgi GT GlcNAcT-I. The transfer of GlcNAc to Man5GlcNAc2Asn by GlcNAcT-I initiates the synthesis of hybrid and complex N-glycans. Hybrid N-glycans keep the five Man residues and extend the arm that received GlcNAc by adding Gal and sialic acid and/or other sugars. To become complex, N-glycans lose the terminal two of the five Man residues and acquire a second GlcNAc to form a biantennary, complex N-glycan (Fig. 1). This may be further branched up to six times and each branch may be elongated by the addition of different sugars including Gal, GlcNAc, GalNAc, Fuc, Sia, and disaccharide units (Stanley et al. 2009). Even a simple CHO cell has complex N-glycans that may carry 60 or more sugar residues (North et al. 2010).Drosophila glycoproteins carry mainly high mannose N-glycans sensitive to cleavage by endoglycosidase H (Endo H), but may also carry complex N-glycans (Aoki et al. 2007; Koles et al. 2007). The complex N-glycans have few sugars. Some neural glycoproteins have N-glycans with terminal sialic acid, and other glycoproteins contain glucuronic acid in antennae and fucose in the core region of N-glycans (Aoki and Tiemeyer 2010; Rendic et al. 2010). C. elegans has high mannose and complex N-glycans with some specialized features such as the incorporation of phosphorylcholine on GlcNAc (Cipollo et al. 2005). Yeast glycoproteins enter the cis-Golgi with mainly Man8GlcNAc2Asn at N-glycan sites, the same as Drosophila and mammals. However, these N-glycans quickly acquire additional Man residues and ultimately form yeast mannan with long chains of Man that may be substituted with phosphate (Munro 2001).The initiation of O-glycosylation also occurs in the ER for most O-glycans and consists of the addition of only a single sugar residue to Ser or Thr. The most abundant types of O-glycosylation are represented by the O-glycans termed mucins initiated by GalNAc-Ser/Thr and the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains on proteoglycans initiated by Xyl-Ser (Fig. 1). Mucin O-glycans are extended in the Golgi by the addition of Gal, GlcNAc, sialic acid and fucose to form linear or branched O-GalNAc glycans (Brockhausen et al. 2009)(Fig. 1). There are more than 15 polypeptide GalNAc transferases (ppGalNAcT) in mammals and several in Drosophila (Zhang and Ten Hagen 2010), but none in yeast. Much work has been devoted to determining consensus sites for O-GalNAc addition to Ser or Thr and criteria are beginning to appear (Caragea et al. 2007; Gerken et al. 2008).GAG chains attached to Ser have a common core of four sugars (Fig. 1, green shaded) completed in the early Golgi and extended by disaccharide units to form long linear polymers to generate heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (Fig. 1). Characteristic of GAGs is the modification of their sugars by sulfate at specific positions. These modifications occur in blocks that generate discrete regions of binding specificity and have been referred to in heparan sulfate and heparin as the “HS code” (Bulow et al. 2008). Sulfotransferases and sulfamidases of the Golgi may dynamically regulate such a code. Drosophila and C. elegans synthesize GAGs and proteoglycans, but yeast do not. The consensus site for addition of xylose and initiation of a GAG chain is a-a-a-a-G-S-G-a-a/G-a (“a” representing Asp or Glu) (Roch et al. 2010).The EGF-like repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch and other vertebrate proteins are modified by O-fucose and O-glucose glycans (Rampal et al. 2007; Stanley and Okajima 2010), as well as O-GlcNAc (Matsuura et al. 2008; Fig. 1). The first sugar in each case is added in the ER and requires a correctly folded EGF-like repeat that contains a specific consensus site (Panin et al. 2002; Takeuchi and Haltiwanger 2010; T. Okajima, personal communication). O-fucose and O-glucose glycans are known to be extended in the Golgi of mammalian cells (Fig. 1), and there is the potential for O-GlcNAc to acquire Gal, GlcNAc, sialic acid, and fucose. Drosophila also expresses these O-glycans on EGF-like repeats of Notch and other proteins. However, O-fucose glycans in Drosophila may have a glucuronic acid attached to the O-fucose (Aoki et al. 2008), and there is no evidence for the addition of Gal or sialic acid to the GlcNAc (Xu et al. 2007). C. elegans has protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (Loriol et al. 2006), but no close homologue of Fringe, the transferase that adds GlcNAc to Fucose-O-EGF (Bruckner et al. 2000; Moloney et al. 2000). The O-glucose glycans on EGF repeats appear to have emerged with Notch signaling in the metazoa (Acar et al. 2008; Sethi et al. 2010).Thrombospondins and other proteins with TSP repeats have consensus sites for two unusual glycans (Fig. 1). The addition of C-linked Man to tryptophan is thought to occur in the ER (Doucey et al. 1998) and no further modification in the Golgi has been observed to date (Wang et al. 2009). The O-fucose glycan of TSP repeats is also initiated in the ER, but it is extended in the Golgi with a single Glc (Kozma et al. 2006).Yeast are not known to generate any of the O-glycans described above. However, yeast synthesize O-glycans initiated with O-mannose in the ER and extended with Man in the Golgi. Mammals and Drosophila also make O-mannose glycans, initiated from Dol-P-Man in the ER and extended in mammals in the Golgi (Fig. 1). O-mannose glycans are rare and concentrated in brain and other tissues that express α-dystroglycan. They are required on α-dystroglycan for it to functionally bind to the extracellular matrix, and disruptions of O-mannose glycan synthesis lead to muscular dystrophies (Moore and Hewitt 2009; Nakamura et al. 2010).In mammals, the first sugar to be added to ceramide (Cer) is added in the ER. Glc-Cer may not be further modified during passage through the Golgi, may have one or two sugars added (Fig. 1), or may be extensively modified by a battery of GTs localized in different compartments of the Golgi (Schnaar et al. 2009). GSL may carry up to eight sugars attached to Glc-Cer. Another abundant glycolipid in certain tissues is sulfatide (Fig. 1) (SO4-Gal-Cer).The synthesis and transfer of a GPI anchor occurs in the ER and the mature ER structure is shown in Figure 1 (teal shaded). A phosphatidylethanolamine is added in the Golgi in mammals (Fujita and Kinoshita 2010). In addition, in the Golgi the Man residues of the anchor may be substituted with additional Man residues or GlcNAc, which can then be extended with Gal and sialic acid (Ferguson et al. 2009). Novel Golgi GTs responsible for generating mature GPI anchors are still being uncovered (Izquierdo et al. 2009). The GPI-anchored protein is finally located in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1).Glycosylation in the Golgi is controlled by the spectrum of GTs, nucleotide sugar synthases, and transporters expressed by a cell, as well as factors that affect the lumenal Golgi environment, and the structure and organization of Golgi membranes. Changes of Golgi pH have long been known to alter glycosylation, and an anion channel has now been identified that regulates Golgi pH (Maeda et al. 2008; Maeda and Kinoshita 2010). Cells lacking this ion channel transport glycoproteins slowly through the secretory pathway, and the glycosylation of both glycoproteins and glycolipids is truncated in these cells. Interestingly, passage through the Golgi is also slowed if the CMP-Sia or GDP-fucose transporters or both are knocked down using RNAi, or by CMP-Sia transporter mutation in Lec2 CHO cells (Xu et al. 2010). In cells with reduced nucleotide sugar transport, glycoproteins with truncated glycans accumulate in the Golgi rather than proceeding to the plasma membrane or to secretion. In addition, ER stress pathways are activated in cells in which nucleotide sugar transport is inhibited (Xu et al. 2010). In Drosophila cells in culture, separate knockdown of two different ppGalNAcTs causes a slowdown in secretion and an alteration in Golgi organization, as well as reduced transfer of GalNAc to mucin glycoproteins (Zhang and Ten Hagen 2010). Thus, Golgi resident proteins appear to contribute to the overall integrity and function of the Golgi.Other factors in the Golgi lumen that are important for glycosylation are the nucleotide sugar pyrophosphorylases that hydrolyse released nucleotide diphosphates, as their number and activity will affect nucleotide sugar import (Berninsone and Hirschberg 2000; Fig. 2). Chaperones important for certain glycosyltransferases to leave the ER may also function in the Golgi. For example, COSMC is necessary for T-synthase to move along the secretory pathway and to be active in the Golgi (Wang et al. 2010). In another example, the putative glycosyltansferase Large must physically associate with α-dystroglycan to be functional in modifying this substrate in the Golgi (Kanagawa et al. 2004). Recently, inhibitors of glycosyltransferase activities have been discovered. One of these inhibits the activity of GlcNAcT-I, the transferase that initiates the synthesis of complex and hybrid N-glycans (Huang and Stanley 2010). It is a testis-specific glycoprotein that binds to GlcNAcT-I as well as some other medial Golgi enzymes, but appears to inactivate only GlcNAcT-I. It is termed GlcNAcT-I Inhibitory Protein (GnT1IP) and its expression is tightly regulated during spermatogenesis. Another example is a class of proteins of the transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif-containing (TMBIM) family that inhibit Gb3 synthase that generates the glycolipid Gb3, the receptor of Shiga toxin (Yamaji et al. 2010). Yet another mechanism of glycosylation regulation is to change the Golgi content of a glycosyltransferase by relocation. This has been recently described for several ppGalNAcTs that transfer GalNAc to Ser or Thr and initiate mucin glycan synthesis (Gill et al. 2010). Growth factor stimulation of Src tyrosine kinase activity, or injection of activated Src kinase, causes a large proportion of all ppGalNAcTs tested to shift from the Golgi to the ER, which results in an increase in total GalNAc addition to proteins. This is a COP1-mediated process and is dependent on the Arf1 GTPase. Medial Golgi enzymes tested, or the Golgi tethering protein giantin, were not redistributed by Src activation.Mutations in proteins of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex that provides a scaffold important for Golgi membrane structure and tethering of retrograde vesicles, also cause alterations in glycosylation (Smith and Lupashin 2008). The first member of the eight subunits of the COG complex was discovered in a CHO mutant ldlC that has defects in N- and O-glycan and glycolipid synthesis (Podos et al. 1994). Several COG subunits have now been shown to be mutated and to give rise to glycosylation defects in patients with congenital diseases of glycosylation (Zeevaert et al. 2008; Foulquier 2009; Lubbehusen et al. 2010). The mechanism by which COG defects alter multiple glycosylation pathways appears to be caused by partial relocation and degradation of Golgi glycosyltransferases and other glycosylation activities when COG is dysfunctional (see Freeze and Elbein 2009).The fact that glycosyltransferase and processing glycosidase reactions are spaced along Golgi membrane compartments means that glycans are gradually built up before exit from the TGN, and may be used as markers of passage through the Golgi. N-glycans in particular have been used extensively to monitor whether a glycoprotein traffics through the Golgi. The general rationale is shown in Figure 4. N-glycans of glycoproteins in the cis-Golgi are all high mannose and are susceptible to removal by cleavage using Endo H or peptide N-glycosidase (N-glycanase). Complex N-glycans with only three Man residues in the core, are resistant to removal by Endo H, but remain sensitive to N-glycanase. Because N-glycans usually contribute substantially to the molecular weight of a glycoprotein, simple comparisons by gel electrophoresis are used to detect glycosidase sensitivity. An important caveat however, is that only resistance to Endo H can be interpreted as evidence of passage through the Golgi. This is because a glycoprotein may fold in such a way that high mannose N-glycans never become complex, even though it passes through the Golgi. The same is true for hybrid N-glycans that contain five core Man residues and never become Endo H resistant.Golgi glycans as tags. Glycoproteins in the ER, ERGIC, and cis-Golgi have high mannose N-glycans that are all susceptible to release by Endo H. Processing α-mannosidases generate the Man5GlcNAc2Asn N-glycan shown above in the medial-Golgi to which GlcNAcT-I transfers a GlcNAc on the left terminal Man residue. Hybrid N-glycans result from the extension of this GlcNAc but the Man5GlcNAc2Asn core is not further processed and remains sensitive to Endo H. Complex N-glycans are formed by the removal of two Man residues following the action of GlcNAcT-I and the addition of a second GlcNAc by GlcNAcT-II. Further extension gives rise to the biantennary complex N-glycan shown in the diagram. Complex N-glycans are resistant to Endo H. Both high mannose and complex N-glycans are sensitive to removal by N-glycanase, whose action generates an Asp in place of Asn, a change that may be used to identify N-glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry.Other glycosidases may also be used to detect exposure to a particular Golgi compartment. The presence of sialic acid residues on glycoproteins exposed to the trans-Golgi or TGN may be ascertained by sialidase treatment. Gal residues added in the trans-Golgi can be removed by treatment with a galactosidase and GlcNAc residues added in the medial Golgi can be removed using hexosaminidases. Monitoring sensitivity by gel electrophoresis is feasible provided at least two to three sugars are removed or sugars are specifically labeled.Experimental approaches that have been very productive and still have much potential are the use of glycosylation mutants in intracellular trafficking assays. This approach was pioneered by James Rothman using the CHO mutant 15B (or Lec1) in mammalian cells (Fries and Rothman 1980). These mutants lack GlcNAcT-I activity in the medial Golgi, and thus by mixing Golgi membranes from mutant with membranes from wild type in vitro, glycoprotein transfer between them could be determined by the acquisition of the product of GlcNAcT-I activity only present in wild type Golgi membranes. This approach was widely adopted and several elegant trafficking assays were designed using CHO mutants with different glycosylation defects (Brandli 1991). Although these assays have now been superseded to a large extent by permeabilized cell and knockdown strategies, there are a battery of glycosylation mutants in CHO cells (Patnaik and Stanley 2006), BHK21 cells (Stojanovic et al. 1984), MDCK cells (Brandli et al. 1988), and HEK293T cells(Reeves et al. 2002; Crispin et al. 2009) that could be helpful. Mutant lines with a well-characterized defect in glycan biosynthesis have many applications such as determining functions for glycans in cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions, and generating recombinant molecules with tailored glycans for functional studies and glycosylation engineering (Stanley 1992). For example, Lec1 CHO cells with inactive GlcNAcT-I (Chen and Stanley 2003), have an intact N-glycan pathway in the ER where N-glycans are important for folding and quality control (Maattanen et al. 2010), through the cis-Golgi and to the medial-Golgi, but glycoproteins made in Lec1 cells never acquire complex or hybrid N-glycans because their synthesis must be initiated by GlcNAcT-I. These high mannose N-glycans may be used to affinity purify a glycoprotein using lectins, to identify mannose binding proteins, to determine if complex N-glycans are necessary for function, and to generate correctly folded glycoproteins with only a single GlcNAc at most (if not all) N-glycan sites by Endo H treatment. The latter has been particularly helpful in generating crystals for structural studies (Bouyain et al. 2005).Golgi glycosylation is a complex and highly dynamic process that is essential for the production of fully functional glycoproteins, glycolipids, proteoglycans, and GPI-anchored proteins, and for the timely transport of membrane and secreted proteins. The enzymes, transporters, chaperones, and inhibitors that regulate glycosylation must function together in a crowded environment that is sensitive to perturbations in pH, Golgi peripheral membrane structure and the content of Golgi membrane proteins. Understanding each glycosylation step in all the different pathways, and the consequences of blocking glycosylation at any point, is important for the generation of tools and strategies in cell biology and Golgi research, and for understanding pathogenic mechanisms of Golgi glycosylation malfunction at the cellular and organismal level.The author thanks Yuko Tashima for critical comments on the manuscript and NCI grants RO1 30645 and 36434 for support.Editors: Graham Warren and James RothmanEditors: Graham Warren and James RothmanAdditional Perspectives on The Golgi available at www.cshperspectives.orgAdditional Perspectives on The Golgi available at www.cshperspectives.org"
PMC3068689,"Role of Vibrio polysaccharide (vps) genes in VPS production, biofilm formation and Vibrio cholerae pathogenesis",False,"Biofilm formation enhances the survival and persistence of the facultative human pathogen Vibrio cholerae in natural ecosystems and its transmission during seasonal cholera outbreaks. A major component of the V. cholerae biofilm matrix is the Vibrio polysaccharide (VPS), which is essential for development of three-dimensional biofilm structures. The vps genes are clustered in two regions, the vps-I cluster (vpsU, vpsA–K, VC0916–27) and the vps-II cluster (vpsL–Q, VC0934–39), separated by an intergenic region containing the rbm gene cluster that encodes biofilm matrix proteins. In-frame deletions of the vps clusters and genes encoding matrix proteins drastically altered biofilm formation phenotypes. To determine which genes within the vps gene clusters are required for biofilm formation and VPS synthesis, we generated in-frame deletion mutants for all the vps genes. Many of these mutants exhibited reduced capacity to produce VPS and biofilms. Infant mouse colonization assays revealed that mutants lacking either vps clusters or rbmA (encoding secreted matrix protein RbmA) exhibited a defect in intestinal colonization compared to the wild-type. Understanding the roles of the various vps gene products will aid in the biochemical characterization of the VPS biosynthetic pathway and elucidate how vps gene products contribute to VPS biosynthesis, biofilm formation and virulence in V. cholerae.Vibrio cholerae causes the diarrhoeal disease cholera (Kaper et al., 1995) and is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems (Faruque et al., 1998). V. cholerae's ability to cause epidemics is linked to its ability to survive in its natural habitats, which is enhanced by its ability to form matrix-enclosed, surface-associated communities, known as biofilms (Alam et al., 2006; Faruque et al., 1998). In aquatic habitats, V. cholerae can be isolated from surfaces of phytoplankton, zooplankton, aquatic plants, crustaceans and insects, as well as sediments (Broza et al., 2005; Halpern et al., 2004; Huq et al., 1983, 1986, 1995), and biofilm formation facilitates environmental survival of the pathogen. Biofilms are also critical for the transmission and infectivity of V. cholerae. Removal of particles >20 μm in diameter from water can reduce cholera incidence (Colwell et al., 2003; Huo et al., 1996). Furthermore, stool samples of cholera patients contain both biofilm-like aggregates and planktonic forms of V. cholerae (Faruque et al., 2006), and the average infectivity of the aggregate form is significantly higher than that of planktonic cells (Faruque et al., 2006). Altogether, these studies indicate the importance of the biofilm growth mode in both the intestinal and aquatic phases of V. cholerae's life cycle.Formation of mature biofilms requires the production of extracellular matrix components. A major component of the V. cholerae biofilm matrix is VPS (Vibrio
polysaccharide) exopolysaccharide, which is required for the formation of mature biofilm structures (Yildiz & Schoolnik, 1999), while matrix proteins, in particular RbmA, RbmC and Bap1, are required for maintaining the structural integrity of the wild-type biofilm (Fong & Yildiz, 2007; Fong et al., 2006). VPS was first isolated from a rugose wild-type strain of V. cholerae that exhibited enhanced capacity to produce VPS, and consequently enhanced biofilm formation compared to the smooth wild-type strain. VPS of V. cholerae O1 El Tor strain A1552 contains glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine and mannose, and the genes required for VPS synthesis were identified through transposon mutagenesis (Yildiz & Schoolnik, 1999). The vps genes are clustered in two regions on the large chromosome of V. cholerae O1 El Tor [vpsU (VC0916), vpsA–K (VC0917–27) (vps-I cluster); and vpsL–Q (VC0934–9) (vps-II cluster)]. However, it is not known if all the genes within the vps-I and vps-II clusters are required for biofilm formation and VPS production.Several studies suggest that VPS is produced during infection and could contribute to in vivo colonization and survival. It has been shown that vpsH (VC0924), involved in VPS production, is induced during in vivo growth in an infant mouse model system (Lee et al., 2001). Furthermore, an in vivo expression technology (IVET) screen performed in human volunteers to identify genes expressed during infection revealed that several vps genes, namely vpsA (VC0917), vpsB (VC0918), vpsC (VC0919) and vpsN (VC0936), are expressed during human infection (Lombardo et al., 2007). In vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) has also shown that sera from cholera patients recognize VpsH (VC0924), which is required for VPS production (Hang et al., 2003). Hung et al. (2006) reported that bile acids stimulate vps transcription and in vitro biofilm formation. A recent study has also shown that both planktonic and aggregated forms (which are predicted to result from in vivo biofilms) of V. cholerae are shed in human stools (Faruque et al., 2006). In addition, it was recently shown that VpsR, the master regulator of biofilm formation and vps expression, directly activates transcription of aphA, which encodes a positive transcriptional regulator of virulence gene expression in V. cholerae (Lin et al., 2007). Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that vps genes are expressed and probably important in vivo.In this study, we generated in-frame deletions of all the vps genes located in the vps-I and vps-II clusters and determined the role of these VPS proteins in biofilm formation and VPS biosynthesis. We also analysed the contribution of VPS and matrix proteins to in vivo fitness of V. cholerae.The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. All V. cholerae and Escherichia coli strains were routinely grown aerobically in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium (1 % tryptone, 0.5 % yeast extract, 1 % NaCl) at 30 °C and 37 °C respectively, unless otherwise noted. Agar medium contained 1.5 % granulated agar (Difco). Concentrations of antibiotics used were as follows: ampicillin, 100 μg ml−1; rifampicin, 100 μg ml−1; gentamicin, 50 μg ml−1.Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyRestriction enzymes, DNA modification enzymes and Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. PCRs were carried out with primers purchased from Bioneer USA Corporation, listed in Supplementary Table S1, available with the online version of this paper. DNA sequencing was carried out by the Sequetech Corporation.Deletion mutants were generated according to the protocol previously published (Fong et al., 2006; Fullner & Mekalanos, 1999). The DNA sequences of the constructed deletion plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing.For analysis of corrugated colony morphology development, cultures grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking (200 r.p.m.) were serially diluted with LB medium and 100 μl aliquots of the diluted cultures were plated onto LB agar medium. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. For analysis of pellicle formation, glass culture tubes (18×150 mm) containing 5 ml LB medium were inoculated with overnight-grown cultures, resulting in a 200-fold dilution. The tubes were incubated at 30 °C under non-shaking conditions for 2 days. Assays were repeated with at least two different biological replicates.Isolation of crude VPS from wild-type and mutant strains and immunoblot analyses of the extracted VPS were carried out according to a protocol similar to those previously published (Enos-Berlage & McCarter, 2000; Fong & Yildiz, 2007; Yildiz & Schoolnik, 1999). Briefly, overnight-grown cultures on LB agar medium were harvested and resuspended in PBS. Normalization was carried out by adjusting each culture to the same OD600, measured with a Beckman Du Series 500 spectrophotometer. Equal volumes of the cultures were pipetted into Erlenmeyer flasks and the suspension was incubated overnight at 4 °C, shaking at 100 r.p.m. Crude VPS supernatant was separated from the bacterial cells and debris by centrifugation twice at 20 000 g for 30 min and precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol at −20 °C overnight. Crude VPS was pelleted by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 30 min, washed with 70 % ethanol, air-dried and resuspended in 500 μl water. Purified VPS from the wild-type rugose variant was used as a positive control and for quantification. Purified VPS was isolated as described above with additional purification steps published previously (Fong & Yildiz, 2007). Briefly, crude VPS pellet was resuspended in nuclease buffer (40 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 0.05 % NaN3). DNase I and RNase A were added to the VPS suspension at final concentrations of 2 units ml−1 and 50 μg ml−1, respectively, followed by incubation at 37 °C shaking for 8 h. Proteinase K was then added at a final concentration of 200 μg ml−1, and the suspension was further incubated with shaking overnight at 37 °C. Phenol/chloroform extractions (equal volumes) were carried out, followed by precipitation with 3 volumes of ethanol, washing with 70 % ethanol, and solubilization in water. Detoxi-Gel endotoxin-removing gel (Pierce) was used to remove contaminating lipopolysaccharides (LPS) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the purified VPS suspension was dialysed with water at 4 °C overnight using a Slide-A-Lyser 3.5K MWCO dialysis cassette (Pierce). The VPS suspension was then dried using a Micro Modulyo freeze-drier (Thermo Savant), the dry weight of the VPS sample was determined and the dried purified VPS was resolubilized in water. Crude and purified VPS (3 μl) was spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblot analyses were carried out using anti-VPS antiserum and goat anti-rabbit horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated antibody. The immunoblots were developed with the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent kit (Pierce) and quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). VPS immunoblot analyses were carried out with two different biological replicates and at least three technical replicates. It should be noted that the VPS antibody used in this study is polyclonal, with undefined epitopes. As such, the immunoblot assay was used as a phenotypic screen to identify mutants that cannot produce ‘wild-type’ VPS and not for determining the effect of a given mutation on the VPS structure.Biofilm formation assays were carried out in PVC microtitre plates (BD Falcon) with 100 μl of overnight-grown cultures diluted to an OD600 of 0.04. The microtitre plates were incubated at 30 °C for 8 h. Crystal violet staining and ethanol solubilization were carried out as previously described (Fong et al., 2006; Yildiz et al., 2001). Absorbance of the solubilized crystal violet stain was measured at 595 nm using a VersMax Tunable Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). The assays were repeated with at least two different biological replicates and at least five technical replicates.V. cholerae wild-type and deletion strains were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) according to the procedure previously described (Fong et al., 2006). Flow-cell experiments were carried out at room temperature as described previously (Beyhan et al., 2007). Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M laser scanning microscope. 3D images of the biofilms were reconstructed using imaris software (Bitplane) and quantified using comstat (Heydorn et al., 2000). Experiments were carried out with at least two biological replicates.The infant mouse intestinal colonization model system was used in the single-strain infection experiment. Oral administration of 106 exponential-phase V. cholerae wild-type variants or deletion mutants (unable to produce biofilm matrix components) to 4–5-day-old CD-1 suckling mice was carried out. At 20 h post-infection, the mice were sacrificed and their small intestines were removed and homogenized. Intestinal homogenates were serially diluted and plated onto selective agar. The number of bacteria per intestine was quantified by colony counting and used to determine intestinal colonization of the mutant strain. One-way ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis test) was performed to determine statistically significant differences. Individual groups were then compared using the Mann–Whitney non-parametric t-test; a P-value of ≤0.05 was considered significant (Prism 5, GraphPad Software).A major component of V. cholerae biofilm matrix is the VPS exopolysaccharide. VPS production is mediated by proteins encoded by the vps genes, which are organized into vps-I and vps-II clusters on the large chromosome, separated by an 8.3 kb intergenic region containing six genes (Fong & Yildiz, 2007; Fong et al., 2006; Yildiz & Schoolnik, 1999). There are 18 vps genes, 12 of which are located in the vps-I cluster (vpsU, VC0916; vpsA–K, VC0917–27), while the other six are located in the vps-II cluster (vpsL-Q, VC0934–9) (Fig. 1). To determine if all the vps gene products are required for biofilm formation, we generated in-frame deletion mutants for each vps gene in the wild-type rugose genetic background (hereafter referred as RΔ). We also constructed mutant strains containing deletions of the first and/or second vps clusters [RΔvps-I (vpsA–K), RΔvps-II (vpsL–Q) and RΔvps-IΔvps-II]. We then characterized the mutants for colony morphology, pellicle formation, biofilm formation and VPS production (Table 2). It is important to note that the deletion strains do not exhibit growth defects when compared to the parental wild-type strain (data not shown).Genomic organization of genes involved in VPS and matrix protein production in V. cholerae. Loci of the genes encoding proteins involved in VPS biosynthesis (vps-I and vps-II clusters) and genes encoding matrix proteins (rbm cluster and bap1) on the V. cholerae chromosome are depicted. Arrows represent genes predicted to be involved in VPS biosynthesis (black), encoding hypothetical proteins (grey) and encoding matrix proteins RbmA, RbmC and Bap1 (hatched), and other genes found in the vps-intergenic region (white arrows).

We termed these phenotypes ‘rugosity-associated phenotypes’. Mature biofilm formed by the rugose wild-type also exhibited the characteristic elaborate 3D structures as analysed by CSLM (Fig. 5). We first characterized strains lacking the vps clusters (RΔvps-I, RΔvps-II and RΔvps-IΔvps-II). These mutant strains formed flat and smooth colonies (Fig. 2), and exhibited a marked decrease in the production or secretion of VPS (Fig. 4b, c), and reduction in the ability to form pellicles (Fig. 3) and biofilms (Fig. 4a). CSLM analysis of biofilms of the rugose wild-type and RΔvps-IΔvps-II revealed that the latter is unable to form the elaborate 3D mature biofilm structures (Fig. 5). comstat analysis revealed that total biomass, and mean and maximum thicknesses, are lower in RΔvps-IΔvps-II compared to the rugose wild-type, particularly after 24 h (Table 3). Strains carrying in-frame deletions of either the vps-I or vps-II cluster also form biofilms resembling that of RΔvps-IΔvps-II (data not shown).Colony morphology of vps deletion mutants. Colony pictures of rugose wild-type and vps deletion mutants were taken after cultures had been incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. The assay was repeated with two biological replicates. Scale bars represent 0.5 mm.Pellicle formation in vps deletion mutants. Pellicle pictures of rugose wild-type and vps deletion mutants from the top (top panels) and side (lower panels) of the cultures were taken after 2 days of incubation at 30 °C. The assay was repeated with two biological replicates.Biofilm formation and VPS production in vps mutants. (a) Biofilm-forming capacities of the rugose wild-type and vps mutants were determined using the crystal violet staining assay on cultures grown at 30 °C for 8 h under static conditions.

Results are means of at least three technical replicates and error bars represent standard deviations. Assays were repeated with two biological replicates.Biofilm structure analysis of a vps-clusters deletion mutant. CSLM images of horizontal (xy) and vertical (xz) projections (large and side panels, respectively) of biofilm structures formed by rugose wild-type and a mutant strain unable to produce VPS (RΔvps-IΔvps-II) are shown; scale bars represent 40 μm. Assays were repeated with at least two biological replicates.comstat analysis of biofilms formed by rugose wild-type and RΔvps-Ivps-IIValues are means (standard deviations) of data from at least six z-series image stacks.We then analysed the rugosity-associated phenotypes of the individual vps deletion mutants. Based on the predicted amino acid sequences and domains of the vps gene products and their predicted functions, we can group these VPS proteins into six classes (Table 2). Class I consists of proteins that are predicted to be required for production of nucleotide sugar precursors. VpsA is predicted to encode UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase while VpsB is predicted to encode UDP-N-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic acid dehydrogenase. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase catalyses the interconversion of UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine to UDP-N-acetyl-d-mannosamine. The latter is then converted to UDP-N-acetyl-d-mannosaminuronic acid by UDP-N-acetyl-d-mannosamine/mannosaminuronic acid dehydrogenase (Kawamura et al., 1979, 1985). Since VpsA and VpsB are predicted to be involved in the production of nucleotide sugar precursors, it is not surprising that deletion of vpsA and vpsB resulted in strains that exhibited decreased colony corrugation (Fig. 2) and reduction in the ability to form pellicle (Fig. 3), biofilm and VPS (Fig. 4).Class II consists of four predicted glycosyltransferases encoded by vpsD, vpsI, vpsK and vpsL. VpsD and VpsI are classified as members of the glycosyltransferase family 4 (GT4), while VpsK is classified as a member of GT26 in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZY) database (http://www.cazy.org) (Cantarel et al., 2009). Although VpsL is not classified as part of any GT family, the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) database (http://www.uniprot.org/) shows that VpsL contains a bacterial sugar transferase domain (PF02397), suggesting that VpsL is probably a glycosyltransferase. Glycosyltransferases catalyse the transfer of sugar moieties to specific acceptor molecules (Campbell et al., 1997; Whitfield, 2006), forming glycosidic bonds that are predicted to be involved in initiation and/or elongation of VPS subunits (repeat units). Thus, the mutants lacking glycosyltransferase activity are unlikely to produce mature VPS. As expected, strains containing in-frame deletion of these genes (RΔvpsD, RΔvpsI, RΔvpsK and RΔvpsL) exhibited flat and smooth colony morphology (Fig. 2). These mutants were also unable to form a pellicle (Fig. 3), and exhibited a significant reduction in biofilm formation and were unable to produce VPS (Fig. 4).Class III consists of proteins encoded by vpsE, vpsH, vpsN and vpsO that are predicted to be involved in VPS polymerization and export. VpsE contains a predicted polysaccharide synthesis domain (PF01943), which is also found in Wzx-like proteins that are O-antigen translocases involved in LPS export in E. coli (Marolda et al., 2004, 2006; Whitfield, 1995). Besides the presence of the loosely conserved PF01943 domain, there is very low conservation in the protein primary sequence in these Wzx-like proteins (Marolda et al., 2006). Interestingly, PelG from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is involved in biofilm formation, has also been described as a Wzx-like polysaccharide transporter (Vasseur et al., 2005). Based on computational analysis, VpsE is likely to be a polysaccharide export protein. VpsH is annotated as a putative CapK protein in The Institute for Genomic Research Comprehensive Microbial Resource (TIGR-CMR) and UniProt databases. CapK in Staphylococcus aureus is reported to be a possible capsular polysaccharide polymerase (Sau et al., 1997). VpsN is predicted by the UniProt database to encode a polysaccharide export-related protein that contains a polysaccharide export domain (PF02563), also associated with the Wzx-like proteins, suggesting that VpsN may also be involved in polysaccharide export. VpsO is predicted by the UniProt database to contain a PF02706 domain associated with the E. coli chain length determinant protein Wzz (Franco et al., 1998).Mutants in class III may produce lipid-linked subunits of VPS, but not full-length VPS. If VPS transport takes place after complete polymerization in the cytoplasm or periplasm, VPS could accumulate in the cytoplasm or periplasm. Alternatively, unpolymerized or partially polymerized VPS may be secreted. Mutants lacking functional VpsE, VpsN and VpsO produced flat and smooth colonies (Fig. 2), were unable to form a pellicle (Fig. 3), and exhibited drastic reduction in biofilm formation and VPS production (Fig. 4). Although a mutant lacking functional VpsH (RΔvpsH) exhibited smooth colony morphology, it is important to note that the colony is more compact compared to the vps-clusters deletion mutants. Furthermore, RΔvpsH formed a pellicle with altered structures (Fig. 3, top panels) and exhibited a moderate decrease in biofilm formation (Fig. 4a). In addition, RΔvpsH produced much less VPS than the rugose wild-type, but not as little as the vps-cluster deletion mutants (Fig. 4b, c), suggesting that production of VPS intermediates may still occur in RΔvpsH.Class IV consists of proteins that are encoded by vpsC and vpsG. VpsC and VpsG are predicted to be acetyltransferases involved in the addition of acetyl groups to polysaccharide. Mutants lacking the acetyltransferases were expected to produce VPS without acetyl modifications, which are likely to have different biophysical properties from those of the wild-type. RΔvpsG exhibited a significant reduction in colony corrugation but the colonies were not completely flat and smooth (Fig. 2). RΔvpsG also formed a pellicle with altered structure (Fig. 3, top panel), and showed reduced biofilm formation and VPS production (Fig. 4). In contrast, RΔvpsC retained its rugose colony corrugation (Fig. 2), formed a pellicle with structure similar to the rugose variant (Fig. 3) and did not exhibit significant defects in biofilm formation on solid surfaces or VPS production (Fig. 4). The structural modification of alginate by O-acetylation alters its physical properties, including viscosity (Nivens et al., 2001). O-Acetyl groups are required for the formation of mature biofilm structures in alginate-producing mucoid P. aeruginosa strains, as well as for maintenance of chronic P. aeruginosa infections (Pier et al., 2001). VPS is highly viscous, and thus non-acetylated VPS may have reduced viscosity, affecting biofilm structure and stability. While the altered rugosity-associated phenotypes exhibited by RΔvpsG are expected, it is surprising that RΔvpsC formed colonies and pellicles that resemble those of the rugose parent. We also generated a strain carrying in-frame deletions of both vpsC and vpsG. This double mutant exhibited phenotypes similar to those of the single vpsG mutant (Figs 2, ​,33 and ​and4).4). It is possible that VpsC is not a functional acetyltransferase, or that VpsG and VpsC may be required for the modification of different portions of the VPS, or even that these different acetyltransferase may be required at different stages of biofilm formation. We are currently testing these hypotheses.Class V consists of the phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase encoded by vpsU, and deletion of vpsU resulted in a strain with altered colony morphology (Fig. 2), pellicle structure (Fig. 3), biofilm formation and VPS production (Fig. 4). Phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases catalyse the dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Kennelly & Potts, 1999). A number of phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have been identified (Morona et al., 2000, 2002; Soulat et al., 2002; Vincent et al., 1999), and have been shown to be involved in regulation of exopolysaccharide production (Morona et al., 2000; Vincent et al., 2000). The phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases found in Gram-negative bacteria usually contain two conserved active-site sequence motifs (C-X4-C-R and D-P-Y) (Kennelly & Potts, 1999; Su et al., 1994; Vincent et al., 1999), while those found in Gram-positive bacteria usually contain four conserved motifs (Aravind & Koonin, 1998; Morona et al., 2002), except for PtpA and PtpB from S. aureus, which resemble phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases found in Gram-negative bacteria (Soulat et al., 2002). Alignment of VpsU (V. cholerae), Wzb (E. coli), PtpA (P. aeruginosa PAO1) and PtpAB (S. aureus) indeed showed that VpsU contains the two active-site motifs conserved in other similar phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases (data not shown). The altered rugosity-associated phenotypes exhibited by RΔvpsU indicate a role of VpsU in VPS production, although the target for VpsU remains to be determined. In E. coli, Wzb (phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase) and Wzc (protein-tyrosine kinase) function together in the production of the capsular polysaccharide colanic acid (Vincent et al., 2000). Although the UniProt database suggested that VpsO is similar to the chain length determinant protein Wzz based on the presence of a PF02706 domain, blastp search using Wzc peptide sequence identified VpsO as the top match (E-value 4.6×10−22), suggesting that VpsO may be the target of VpsU. We are currently investigating this hypothesis.Class VI consists of hypothetical proteins encoded by vpsF, vpsJ, vpsM, vpsP and vpsQ. While RΔvpsP and RΔvpsQ strains produce VPS and form colonies, pellicles and biofilms similar to those of the wild-type, other mutants lacking vpsF, vpsJ and vpsM exhibited complete loss of colony corrugation, inability to form pellicle and drastic reduction in biofilm formation and VPS production (Figs 2, ​,33 and ​and4).4). Since vpsF, vpsJ and vpsM are predicted to encode hypothetical proteins, identifying the roles of these hypothetical proteins in building the biofilm matrix is critical.Collectively, phenotypic analysis of the vps mutants shows that, under our experimental conditions, most of the VPS proteins are required for wild-type rugose colony corrugation, pellicle and biofilm formation, and VPS production.V. cholerae biofilm formation inside the host and its contribution to pathogenesis is not well understood. While some biofilm-related factors have been studied for their roles in V. cholerae intestinal colonization (Lauriano et al., 2004; Rashid et al., 2004; Watnick et al., 2001; Zhu & Mekalanos, 2003), different research groups have obtained contradictory results regarding the importance of these factors. For example, mutants lacking VpsR, a positive transcriptional regulator of biofilm matrix production, have given variable results for mouse infection, including normal and decreased colonization (Rashid et al., 2004; Tischler & Camilli, 2005). In another study, a rugose variant (resulting from flaA deletion) was found to be defective for infant mouse intestinal colonization in a competition infection, suggesting that a high level of VPS production is detrimental (Watnick et al., 2001). It is therefore evident that many factors, possibly including the presence of VPS and matrix proteins, affect in vivo fitness of V. cholerae.To this end, we carried out experiments to investigate whether known biofilm determinants in V. cholerae contribute to pathogenesis. We initially performed competition experiments using the smooth (low-biofilm-forming) and rugose (high-biofilm-forming) wild-type variants in the commonly used infant mouse model, but did not see a significant difference in the competitive index (data not shown). We reasoned that competition assays alone may be misleading, as VPS produced by the rugose variant could complement the co-inoculated strain in trans, thus masking differences in in vivo fitness. Therefore, we performed single-strain infections in the infant mouse model. We first compared the colonization capacities of smooth and rugose wild-type variants. As shown in Fig. 6, the rugose variant colonized the intestine better (approx. 3.6-fold) than the smooth variant. These data suggest that matrix components contribute to colonization and increase in vivo fitness, since the rugose variant produces more biofilm matrix than the smooth variant. To test this hypothesis, we compared the colonization capacity of the rugose wild-type variant to those of a mutant that is incapable of producing VPS (RΔvps-IΔvps-II) and mutants that are unable to produce matrix proteins (RΔrbmA and RΔrbmCΔbap1). RbmA, RbmC and Bap1 matrix proteins modulate rugosity-associated phenotypes (Fong & Yildiz, 2007; Fong et al., 2006). RbmC and Bap1 share 46.7 % peptide sequence similarity and appear to be partially redundant. Deletion of rbmA and bap1 in the rugose genetic background resulted in strains with altered colony morphology and biofilm formation when compared to the rugose wild-type (Fong & Yildiz, 2007; Fong et al., 2006). Although deletion of rbmC (a homologue of bap1) in the rugose genetic background did not alter the colony morphology and biofilm formation significantly, the double deletion mutant RΔrbmCΔbap1 exhibited a marked decrease in biofilm formation (Fong & Yildiz, 2007).Intestinal colonization phenotypes of V. cholerae wild-type and mutant strains in the infant mouse model. Wild-type smooth and rugose variants and rugose mutant strains lacking the genes required for VPS (RΔvps-IΔvps-II) and matrix protein production (RΔrbmA and RΔrbmCΔbap1) were used in single-strain infections. The data shown are pooled from two experiments, and the horizontal bars indicate the median of each dataset. The asterisks indicate significantly different medians of the recovered c.f.u. compared to the rugose variant as determined by Mann–Whitney U test (smooth P=0.0354, RΔvps-IΔvps-II P=0.0043 and RΔrbmA P=0.0426).We determined that RΔvps-IΔvps-II exhibited a severe defect in intestinal colonization, with a 9.4-fold lower c.f.u. recovery compared to the rugose variant. This result indicates that VPS production increases in vivo fitness. The mutant lacking the biofilm matrix protein RbmA also exhibited a defect in intestinal colonization, with a 4.1-fold lower c.f.u. recovery. This outcome indicates that VPS and RbmA contribute significantly to in vivo fitness of V. cholerae in these models, and that they contribute to biofilm formation in both in vivo and aquatic environments. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the colonization ability of the RΔrbmCΔbap1 double mutant when compared to the rugose variant, indicating that either RbmC and Bap1 do not significantly influence intestinal colonization, or their phenotype is not evident under the experimental conditions utilized, thus suggesting that the major function of these biofilm matrix proteins is in the formation of biofilms in aquatic environments. Collectively, these results indicate that the biofilm matrix components are important in in vitro biofilm formation, and that VPS and RbmA also contribute to in vivo fitness of V. cholerae.The results presented in this study have revealed how the various vps gene products contribute to wild-type biofilm formation and VPS biosynthesis, and have laid the groundwork for future biochemical characterization of the VPS biosynthetic pathway. In vitro experiments carried out with the vps mutants in this study, and rbm mutants in previous studies, clearly demonstrate the importance of matrix components, both VPS and matrix proteins, in the building of a robust wild-type biofilm. In-frame deletion of 15 of the 18 vps genes resulted in strains that exhibited drastic altered rugosity-associated phenotypes (Figs 2, ​,33 and ​and4).4). VPS and RbmA also contribute to in vivo fitness of V. cholerae, as shown in in vivo mouse colonization studies, where mutants not able to produce VPS or RbmA were defective for intestinal colonization (Fig. 6).Humans ingest V. cholerae biofilms as part of the pathogen's normal transmission route. In this study, we have shown that VPS and biofilm matrix proteins are critical for in vitro biofilm formation and are also important for in vivo fitness. The nature of the VPS coating and matrix proteins in the biofilms may influence the progression of the disease, and/or development of an immune response against V. cholerae. A better understanding of biofilm matrix biosynthesis and function could allow us to develop inhibitors that specifically alter the matrix properties and affect either ex vivo (aquatic) survival or in vivo pathogenesis.This study was supported by grants AI055987 to F. H. Y and AI43486 to K. E. K.

PMC3070697,"Computational Bacterial Genome-Wide Analysis of Phylogenetic Profiles
Reveals Potential Virulence Genes of Streptococcus
agalactiae
",False,"The phylogenetic profile of a gene is a reflection of its evolutionary history
and can be defined as the differential presence or absence of a gene in a set of
reference genomes. It has been employed to facilitate the prediction of gene
functions. However, the hypothesis that the application of this concept can also
facilitate the discovery of bacterial virulence factors has not been fully
examined. In this paper, we test this hypothesis and report a computational
pipeline designed to identify previously unknown bacterial virulence genes using
group B streptococcus (GBS) as an example. Phylogenetic profiles of all GBS
genes across 467 bacterial reference genomes were determined by
candidate-against-all BLAST searches,which were then used to identify candidate
virulence genes by machine learning models. Evaluation experiments with known
GBS virulence genes suggested good functional and model consistency in
cross-validation analyses (areas under ROC curve, 0.80 and 0.98 respectively).
Inspection of the top-10 genes in each of the 15 virulence functional groups
revealed at least 15 (of 119) homologous genes implicated in virulence in other
human pathogens but previously unrecognized as potential virulence genes in GBS.
Among these highly-ranked genes, many encode hypothetical proteins with possible
roles in GBS virulence. Thus, our approach has led to the identification of a
set of genes potentially affecting the virulence potential of GBS, which are
potential candidates for further in vitro and in
vivo investigations. This computational pipeline can also be
extended to in silico analysis of virulence determinants of
other bacterial pathogens.Virulence - the ability of a pathogen to damage a host and evade host immune defenses
- arises from a range of complex host-pathogen interactions and can be expressed as
the pathogen's toxicity, invasiveness, colonization, and ability to be
transmitted to another host [1], [2]. Contemporary methods of searching for the genetic
determinants of virulence exploit the differential presence of virulence genes in
invasive pathogens compared to their less invasive counterparts. Several criteria
have been suggested to help formalize this process including molecular Koch's
postulates or adoption of Hill's criteria [3], [4]. In practice, the discovery
process usually involves iterative gene screening via labor-intensive laboratory
experiments. Given the relentless growth in bacterial genomic data, alternative
approaches capable of handling large datasets would facilitate the selection of
potential genes of interest and thus accelerate the discovery of new virulence
genes.The search for virulence genes in pathogenic bacteria has been revolutionized over
the last decade by comparative genomics [5] with rapid advances in DNA
microarrays [6]–[8] and whole-genome sequencing [9]. Purely in
silico approaches have been suggested as an alternative to costly
collections of experimental data. For example, genes that were positively selected
in a uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) genome were identified using
phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (PAML) of several E.
coli genomes and verified in a sample of UPEC clinical isolates [10]. While these
high-throughput methods are powerful, there are practical limitations: DNA
microarrays are limited to detecting genes for which allelic variants have already
been characterized and may miss emerging mutations; the PAML-based approach requires
multiple genomes of phenotypic variants of the same species, which are not always
available.This study utilized an alternate approach that identifies genes with similar
phylogenetic profiles (PPs). A PP is defined as a binary vector
indicating the presence or absence of homologs to the gene in the reference genomes
(Figure 1) and represents
the evolutionary history of the gene among phylogeny of life. Functionally similar
genes are assumed to have distinct yet conserved evolutionary
“footprints” in different strains, species, and genera. While patterns
of PP have been utilized to predict gene functions in other setting [11]–[16], they have not been
systematically applied to the discovery of bacterial virulence factors. We have
developed and validated a computational method of inductive candidate gene
prioritization (ICGP) to predict bacterial gene functions through the
recognition of specific PP signatures [17]. We expect ICGP to be applicable to the discovery of
bacterial virulence factors, in the same way that various forms of host-pathogen
interaction, such as epithelial adhesion or mucosal invasion, may also possess
specific fingerprints that allow their discovery through an in
silico, cross-genomic analysis.For each gene, a candidate-against-all BLAST was performed to determine
whether at least one homolog of a candidate gene is present in a given
reference genome. The binary values of presence (1) or absence (0) were
stored in a vector which were used for subsequent rediscovery analyses and
virulence gene predictions.We hypothesized that the ICGP method can also facilitate the discovery of previously
unrecognized bacterial virulence genes and tested this hypothesis using an important
bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus agalactiae, or group B
streptococcus (GBS), as an example. GBS is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis in
developed countries [18] and GBS infection remains a significant burden despite
implementation of screening programs and antibiotic chemoprophylaxis [19]–[21]. While
experimental studies have identified many GBS virulence genes [22], [23], it is likely that many others
and/or specific allelic variants of known factors, contribute to pathogenesis and
should be taken into account in studies of GBS pathogenesis and drug target
selection. Discovery of new GBS virulence factors could also contribute to more
targeted prenatal screening and facilitate vaccine design [23]. This paper describes the
application of ICGP to published bacterial whole genome sequences with a goal of
identifying GBS genes with putative roles in virulence that may act synergistically
with known genes contributing to pathogenesis of GBS disease.We tested the hypothesis that PP can predict whether a GBS gene is associated
with virulence. We first determined the PPs by examining which GBS genes from
all fully sequenced S. agalactiae genomes are also present in
467 reference genomes of other bacterial species. Evaluation experiments were
subsequently performed to determine whether virulence genes can be rediscovered
by using ICGP trained with functionally-related virulence genes with
corresponding PPs. Two rediscovery experiments were performed to evaluate the
ICGP models on a “gold standard” dataset comprised of all known GBS
virulence genes. Virulence genes were assigned to three major categories,
namely, adhesins, invasins, and immune evasins, and 15 functional gene
categories (fbsA, fbsB, lmb,
pavA, scpB, minor pilin cluster,
cyl cluster, cfb, spb1,
hylB, bca/bac,
cps and neu clusters,
cspA, and pbp1A, Table 1). The first experiment sought to
determine whether ICGP could rediscover currently known virulence genes within a
genome of S. agalactiae serotype III (NEM316, GenBank
accession: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AL732656"",""term_id"":""30407156"",""term_text"":""AL732656""}}AL732656). Among the four algorithms used in ICGP evaluations,
support vector machines (SVM) with radial basis (RBF) and linear kernel
algorithms were the most successful in rediscovering these genes (Table 2) with area under
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of approximately 0.8
evaluated using -fold
cross-validation. In particular, the gene clusters encoding GBS pilus and sialic
acid synthases (neu cluster) achieved almost perfect AUC
(>0.98) in the rediscovery task, indicating that ICGP is able to distinguish
functional groups of genes responsible for specific bacterial virulence
mechanisms.We further examined whether ICGP can rediscover genes with identical PPs. All
genes in the published GBS reference genomes NEM316, A909/Ia (GenBank accession:
{""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CP000114"",""term_id"":""76561771"",""term_text"":""CP000114""}}CP000114), and 2603V/R (GenBank accession: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AE009948"",""term_id"":""22535226"",""term_text"":""AE009948""}}AE009948) were selected as candidate
genes and n-fold cross-validation analyses were performed. The
gene categories for cross-validation were identical to the previous experiment.
As expected, most categories with exactly one orthologous gene led to a perfect
AUC. Overall, the currently known GBS virulence genes were rediscovered with
AUCs as high as 0.98 by the nearest-neighbor classifier IBk with all orthologous
genes included in the cross-validation set (Table 3). AUCs of better than 0.96, 0.89, and
0.95 were achieved for all genes encoding adhesins, invasins, and immune
evasins, respectively (Table
3).We prioritized all genes in three GBS reference genomes to find potential
virulence genes that are yet to be recognized. To generate the gene ranks, we
trained the ICGP models with known virulence factors alongside the corresponding
PPs (see methods section) for each of the 15 virulence gene categories (Table 1). The top-10 genes
from each category (of less than 0.5% of total open reading frames in a
GBS genome) are shown in Figure
2 and listed in Table S1. A total of 119 unique homologous
genes (416 genes in three genomes) occupied 150 possible ranks. ICGP
rediscovered 11 known GBS virulence genes from 119 homologous genes, equivalent
to 48 of 416 genes in all three genomes (11.5%). We estimated that our
prioritization method had an overall enrichment of >5.4 folds (compared with
baseline 134/6,214 genes used for model training, 2.2%). Sixteen of 119
genes were ranked in more than one category. The highly ranked genes of unknown
function encoding hypothetical proteins are listed in Table 4.The figure illustrates the putative S. agalactiae
virulence genes identified in this paper, of which the biological
function have been known in other pathogens or inferred by sequence
similarity with known protein motifs. The cluster IDs
(Cnumber) identify the homolog clusters defined in
Table S2.In addition to the 11 known GBS virulence genes rediscovered, 15 of 119
homologous genes (13%) contributing to mechanisms of virulence in other
pathogens were also recognized. This is equivalent to a 10-fold enrichment (91
potential virulence genes identified from the list of 416 genes in 3 GBS
genomes, 22%, including genes from GBS and other human pathogens
identified in the literature) when compared to current knowledge (2.2%).
Several genes encoding putative adhesins were identified; genes encoding
metallo-binding adhesion lipoproteins (C0520 and C1445) and permease proteins
(C1443 and C0154) were highly ranked. The homologs of these genes in S.
pneumoniae (adcAB, psaA, and
mtsAC genes) promote indirect adherence to epithelial cells
and have contributed to virulence in other Gram-positive pathogens [24]. The gene
product of C1927 is distantly similar to a large 1.1-MDa surface protein Ebh in
Staphylococcus aureus, in which fibronectin-binding
activities have been demonstrated in vitro
[25]. Both
genes C0623 and C2129 contain a collagen-binding cna-B protein domain; Cna
protein is a virulence determinant of staphylococcal septic arthritis in mouse
model, and has been implicated in causing keratitis in human [26], [27].Genes encoding potential invasins have also been recognized within the top-10 of
the ranks. For instance, two glycosidic hydrolase genes, the unsaturated
glucuronyl hydrolase (ugl, C1789) and
β-glucuronidase genes (C0665), may have putative roles in
facilitating the degradation of hyaluronan in synergy with streptococcal
hyaluronidase (encoded by hylB). The peptidase U32 (C0709) is
similar to a metalloprotease gene prtC in Prophyromas
gingivalis, an anaerobe causing periodontitis. PrtC is a known
factor in contributing to the degradation of type I collagen in gingivial
infection [28].Genes that encode mechanisms facilitating the evasion of host immune system were
also found. For example, a gene encoding neuraminidase homologue (C1816) was
highly ranked. In S. pneumoniae, the neuraminidase is known to
cleave the terminal sialic acids of host polysaccharides [29] and promotes the
formation of biofilm [30]. It was also interesting to locate several family 1
and 2 glycosyltransferase genes (GT1: C1330, C1367, GT2: C1459) within the top
rankings of several immune evasins training sets (cspA,
cps and neu clusters); as many of the
cps genes encode glycosyltransferase enzymes [31], these
highly prioritized genes may play a role in the biosynthesis of unrecognized
carbohydrate structures contributing to the antigenic diversity of GBS. This
finding is in concordance with a study which suggested that C1330 (SAG1410 in
2603V/R) encodes an α-galactosyltransferase participating
in group B carbohydrate synthesis [32]. In addition, a gene
encoding putative staphylokinase homolog C1080 (SAG1127 and GBS1195) was found.
Staphylokinase is known to cleave the Fc portion of human IgG and complement C3b
[33]
and to inactivate α-defensin produced by neutrophils during
S. aureus infection [34].Because bacterial pathogenesis is mediated by a variety of distinct molecular
mechanisms, a good gene prioritization model would be expected to identify
different classes of virulence genes from which the predictive model can be
built. To estimate the predictive power of such “cross-group”
discoveries, we examined the rankings of known GBS virulence genes in each the
15 lists produced by ICGP. It was noted that, on average, at least one gene from
a functional category can be discovered in the top 1% of a gene rank
produced by the SVM/RBF algorithm (the best performing algorithm in the first
rediscovery experiment, Table
2) that is trained on genes of another virulence category. A median
of 4 other categories (out of total of 15) was discoverable within the top
5% of a given rank. The cumulative gain plot depicting this phenomenon is
shown in Figure 3.This analysis evaluated how many virulence gene categories are
discoverable at a given position of a prioritized rank. A category is
considered discoverable by another if at least one virulence gene is
present above a given position in the rank is being analyzed. The gene
positions were measured by rank fraction (between 0 and 1) with 0 being
the top of the rank and 1 at the bottom. Candidate genes were ranked by
SVM/RBF algorithm (the best algorithm evaluated in Table 2).Several qualitative observations were made during the cross-group analysis which
supported the plausibility of the prioritized gene lists. For example, at least
one gene from the categories of GBS surface C-antigens (including all
bca, rib and bac genes),
cps, and neu clusters were discoverable
within the top-1% of the ranks of the other two functional categories
(approximately 21 genes including training set genes, Figure 4A). At top 5% (approximately
104 genes including the training set) of the ranks, all but one
(pbp1A) gene category can either be used to discover
through, or at least have one gene being discovered by, another category (Figure 4B). While we did not
identify apparent directions of discovery between the major virulence function
classes (adhesins, invasins, and evasins), these qualitative observations (of
the majority of known GBS virulence genes placed on the top of the prioritized
lists of other functional categories) reconfirmed the capacity of our method to
identify genes with potential impact on virulence within the set of remaining
highly-ranked but functionally unrecognized genes.These figures provide two cross-sectional views of Figure 3 at the positions of
top-1% (A) and -5% (B) respectively. The arrowheads
indicates which other categories of virulence genes were discoverable by
the category at the tail of arrow.To demonstrate that the virulence genes predicted by ICGP do not merely discover
neighboring genes, highly-ranked genes in the NEM316 genome were plotted on the
chromosome map (Figure 5).
It is evident that the newly discovered genes were scattered across the genome.
Comparing the average distance between start codons of neighboring genes (mean:
1,056 bp, 95% confidence interval: 1,018–1,093 bp), the average
distance between the highly-ranked genes and the closest gene of the
corresponding training set was 544,441 bp with a wide range (95% CI:
495,802–593,080 bp), which indicates a clear difference in placement of
predicted virulence genes discovered by the ICGP method (two-sample unpaired
t-test, t = 22.1,
df = 157, ).The highly-ranked genes is shown to be scattered across the entire GBS
genome and not aggregated in close physical proximity. Physical linkages
between the known and the prioritized genes are therefore unlikely. This
illustration demonstrated the novelty of the PP approach for virulence
gene discovery compared with the traditional paradigm of physical
linkage and gene clusters. The blue boxes refer to the known genomic
islands and are discussed in the results section. (*) Predicted by
homology to other reference genomes, as islands (1) and (2) were not
listed in PAI-DB or IslandViewer for NEM316.Several top-ranked genes are located within known genomic islands in two or more
reference genomes: (1) The gene ISSag2 (C1177), encoding a
transposase, was placed within the top-10 on the fbsB rank;
ISSag2 transposase flanks a 17-kbp composite transposon
found in virtually all GBS strains [35] and characterizes a
pathogenicity island (PI) containing virulence genes scpB and
lmb (2603V/R: SAG1228-44, A909: SAK1314-23). (2) Genes
mtsA/C (C1443 and C1445) were discovered in another known
PI (2603V/R: SAG1527-33, A909: SAK1550-6). (3) Genes vex1-3 and
vncR/S were located within the genomic island located at
GBS0587-600 (2603V/R: SAG0608-20, A909: SAK0692-705). While the exact functions
of the vex-vnc clusters remain to be
elucidated, it has been demonstrated that mutants lacking of
vex3 are associated with altered resistance of S.
pneumoniae to vancomycin [36], [37]. (4) Prioritized in the
C-α/β rank, a putative type II DNA
modification methyltransferase (C1224) was found on the predicted genomic island
containing the bac gene, the gene encoding surface protein
C-β antigen, which was bound by GBS1350 and GBS1371 in
NEM316 (2603V/R: SAG1287-97; A909: SAK0720-64).To demonstrate that our approach is generalizable to other species, the
rediscovery experiments were replicated on 6,355 genes in 3 published S.
pneumoniae genomes (D39, R6, and TIGR4). Forty-seven known
pneumococcal virulence genes were arranged into 21 virulence gene groups through
the review of literature [38]: choline-binding protein genes
(cpbC-G), capsular polysaccharide gene cluster
(cps), serine protease gene htrA,
hyaluronidase gene hysA, IgA protease gene
iga1, autolysin genes (lytABC),
neuraminidase genes (nanAB), adhesin and ABC transporter genes
(pavA, piaA, and piuA),
pneumolysin gene ply, a manganese-binding ABC transporter gene
(psaA), peptidylprolyl isomerase genes
(ppmA and slrA), and a
zinc-metalloprotease gene zmpB. It was found that: (1) Within
the top-0.5% of the cbpA-G, lytABC,
nanAB, iga1, zmpB, and
hysA ranks, at least one other gene from the other
virulence gene groups was able to be identified. (2) The de
novo gene lists (of top-0.5% of the prioritized genes) have
also revealed genes suggestive of virulence functions in S.
pneumoniae: putative helicase genes spr0500-3 (in the
hysA, iga1 and nanAB
ranks), ferric-iron permease fatC (in piaA,
piuA, lytB, and cbpB
ranks), murM and exfoliative toxin shetA genes
(in cbpD and hysA ranks),
pyrorolidone-carboxylate peptidase gene (pcp, in
lytC and hysA ranks), alpha-galactosidase
gene aga (with nanAB), a Hes/MoeB/ThiF family
gene (in the cbpE and lytB ranks), as well as
surface proteins spr0583 and pcpA, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase
genes gatT, and hypothetical protein spr0217 (in
pspC, cbpEG, and lytAC
ranks) were revealed. ICGP has also suggested a hemolysin-related protein gene
(spr0737) which was found to be closely associated with ply.
The unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase gene (ugl) was ranked
highly with hysA, and psaA was associated with
laminin-binding protein gene lmb and ABC transporter genes
adcA, psaC, adbC, and
appA. These encouraging results have thus supported the use
of ICGP in virulence gene prediction in other pathogens.This paper demonstrates a new approach to discover potential virulence genes in
bacterial genomes. It describes a computational pipeline using phylogenetic profiles
to identify new virulence genes in S. agalactiae. Fifteen genes,
for which there is evidence of either confirmed or plausible associations with
virulence in other bacterial pathogens have been identified. Many of these genes are
involved in epithelial adhesion, damaging to host cells, or evasion of the host
immune system (Figure 2). While
most of these genes are considered “general” virulence factors, it is
likely that some of them may play an unique role in the pathogenesis of GBS
infection in susceptible newborns. Determining the optimal cut-off of the gene rank
was, however, challenging because it was not possible to estimate the number of
virulence genes in a genome in advance. While other criteria for determining the
significance level may be imposed, for example, inverse of the number of genes in
the target given genome [10], obtaining an objective score for a generative
classification model is less trivial (discussed below). We adopted a more practical
approach by reviewing the top-10 genes (approximately 0.5% of the GBS genome)
of the ranks from each functional category to examine their potential biological
roles. Although the selection of this significance level seemed arbitrary and true
virulence genes may have lower ranks, our results have demonstrated that, by using
this threshold (top-10 genes), the probability of finding a true virulence gene
could be improved by up to 10 times compared with random selection of candidate
genes. Thus, our objective of postulating new GBS candidate virulence genes has been
fulfilled; this is also evident through qualitative analysis of evidence retrieved
from the published literature and databases.Our in silico gene ranking approach offers a new opportunity to
perform a genome-wide identification of virulence genes in bacterial pathogens. The
functional validity of this approach was also strengthened by, for instance, the
ability to recover 6 out of 10 known peptidoglycan genes with the PP of penicillin
binding protein gene, pbp1A. These results support our original
hypothesis that a group of virulence genes with closely-related mechanisms can be
widely distributed across bacterial genomes. Thus, the concept of virulence
gene-infectious disease relationship may be modified from one that involves a simple
association between a gene and a pathogen trait, where virulence is related to the
presence or absence of incriminated genes, to a complex repertoire of widely
distributed genes that confer specific survival advantage on the pathogen. The good
prediction results from our rediscovery experiments imply that there are specific
combination patterns of virulence genes in bacterial pathogens. The existence of
such patterns is conceivable, because the co-occurrence of virulence genes is a
fundamental requirement for pathogen function and interaction with the host at the
cellular level [39]. However, the interpretation and comprehension of these
implicit patterns is challenging. Bowers et al. (2004), for example, analyzed gene
co-occurrence patterns to find higher-order inter-relationships between genes [40]. The
integration of PP-based gene prioritization methods with other data sources should
be explored. For example, mapping PP signatures to gene ontology and annotation
databases, to decipher the underlying meaning of these highly-conserved profiles,
can be of value.There are several points to note in the selection of training data and algorithms.
First, we based our de novo predictions on the individual
categories of virulence function as opposed to a training set consisting of all
known virulence factors. Although novel genes may be revealed by training the ICGP
models with the aggregated training set, the categorized approach can be justified
because results are likely to be skewed towards gene functions presented with higher
proportion in the training set (see Text S1). It is also evident that training sets
with higher functional consistency at molecular level have better cross-validation
results. For example, the category of neu cluster is more
consistent over the broader category of immune system evasins. Second, we selected
ICGP algorithms based on the results of our previous work, which showed that the
discriminative classifiers outperformed the generative model of naïve Bayes in
a set of standard prioritization tasks [17]. One disadvantage of using a discriminative model is that
the classifier outputs do not generally correspond to a true probability
distribution of gene-function relationships. Although attempts were made to rectify
the probability estimates for models such as SVM (i.e., fitting logistic models to
output and aggregating individual rankings by voting), the distribution of scores
still depends on individual algorithms. This may also explain the disparity of good
rediscovery performances achieved by most algorithms (Table 2) and poor agreements between individual
gene rankings (Text
S2). Thirdly, our approach only aims to recover the genes having similar
phylogenetic profile to the known virulence factors. In cases where no virulence
genes are known, alternative methods would need to be sought for the gene
prioritization task.In conclusion, we have performed a computational genome-wide prioritization for
discovering potential virulence genes in S. agalactiae through a
cross-genomic analysis of PPs. Our comparative genomic approach requires fewer
genomes of the target virulence species for hypothesizing potential virulence genes.
A number of plausible molecular mechanisms have been revealed, some of which have
been documented in other bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, we have significantly
extended the number of potential bacterial gene targets for drug and vaccine design
by identifying highly-ranked yet uncharacterized candidate genes which may have
roles in GBS virulence. This approach can also be applicable to the discovery of
virulence genes in other bacterial pathogens.The phylogenetic profiles of the whole genome of three strains of S.
agalactiae A909 [41], NEM316 [42], and 2603V/R [9] were
determined by searching the occurrence of 6,214 genes in 467 annotated bacterial
genomes retrieved from National Center for Biotechnology Information database
(NCBI, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/; downloaded in
April 2007) by using Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm
(blastp program). The presence of a potential homologous gene was determined at
the critical E-value of  (Dataset S1). For
each known GBS virulence factor, a further literature search was performed and
the location of associated genes identified and labeled in the reference genomes
(see Text
S3 for more details). The criteria for grouping of the known
virulence factors into 15 functional categories were: discriminable by BLAST and
a distinguishable biological mechanism in GBS pathogenesis.Descriptive analysis of the PPs revealed that 527 of 6,124 genes (8.5%)
were specific to GBS (present in at least 1 of the 3 genomes), including
4.2% of genes specific to individual GBS reference strains. Four hundred
and seventy seven genes (7.7%) were present in >95% of
reference genomes. Overall, the 467-genome panel was able to characterize GBS
genes into large numbers of genotypes in 2603V/R (1,712 types), NEM316(1,675
types), and A909 (1,689 types) genomes respectively. This is equivalent to
approximately 80–85% of unique genotypes when compared to the
number of genes per GBS genome, indicating that our PP panel can be used to
characterize individual genes with satisfactory discriminatory power. The
inclusion of multiple genomes per species may have introduced redundancy, as all
NCBI genomes were used as the reference panel. However, it has been previously
shown that redundancy did not result in performance penalties in machine
learning-based gene prioritization methods [17] and hence a more inclusive
approach was adopted in the selection of reference genomes.Four machine learning algorithms were applied to each of the functional
categories of known GBS genes. Algorithm selection was based on performance in
our previous work [17]. The algorithms include: support vector machine with
linear kernel (SVM/Poly, trained by sequential minimization optimization
algorithm), SVM with RBF kernels (SVM/RBF), alternating decision tree (ADTree
with number of boosting iterations set to 10), and k-nearest
neighbor classifier (IBk with inverse distance weighing where k
was determined by leave-one-out cross-validation). The output of each classifier
was used for the basis for gene ranking. Logistic models were fitted to estimate
the posterior probabilities of both SVM algorithms. Algorithms were implemented
using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) version 3.5.6 [43].For each functional GBS gene category containing n virulence
genes, a n-fold cross-validation was performed, with the
remaining candidate genes assigned a negative class. Rediscovery performance was
measured by AUC for each combination of algorithm and gene category. All genes
in NEM316 genome were used for cross-validation in the first rediscovery
experiment, and all genes from the 3 reference genomes were applied in the
second experiment.For each functional category, all of known virulence genes were labeled as
positive gene examples in the training set. To reduce the oversampling of
negative classes, only a subset of the remaining unlabeled genes were labeled as
negative examples in the training set. The remaining 3/4 of candidate genes were
randomly sampled without replacement and were assigned a negative class.
Predictions were made on the remaining one-quarter of the unknown genes and
scores from each run were obtained for each gene to be predicted. The above
procedure was repeated for 1000 runs to improve coverage. Scores from each run
were averaged by arithmetic means which formed the basis of ranking. This
procedure is detailed in Text S3.To increase the likelihood of identifying true virulence genes, we aggregated
ranks produced by 4 machine learning algorithms into a final rank by using the
following voting function:where
g is a candidate gene,  is the final
aggregated score of gene ,
 is number of ranks (), X is an uniform
random variable, and  is the rank
fraction (position of the rank, starting from 1, divided by the total number of
genes in the entire list) of rank .Because homologous (including both orthologs and closely-related paralogs) genes
would appear multiple times in close proximity in a prioritized rank due to high
degrees of similarities in PPs, the genes from each resultant rank were collated
into homolog clusters to ease the interpretation of results. The reciprocal best
BLAST hit method described by Hirsh et al. was employed [44]. The complete list of
homolog clusters is shown in Table S2.The participation of genes in genomic islands was examined by search against the
IslandViewer database [45] and PAthogenicity Island DataBase (PAI-DB) [46].The phylogenetic profiles of all 6,214 genes of 3 GBS genomes (NEM316,

PMC3082856,Identification of the sequence motif of glycoside hydrolase 13 family members,False,"A bioinformatics analysis of sequences of enzymes of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) 13 family members such as α-amylase, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase
(CGTase), branching enzyme and cyclomaltodextrinase has been carried out in order to find out the sequence motifs that govern the reactions specificities of these
enzymes by using hidden Markov model (HMM) profile. This analysis suggests the existence of such sequence motifs and residues of these motifs constituting the
−1 to +3 catalytic subsites of the enzyme. Hence, by introducing mutations in the residues of these four subsites, one can change the reaction specificities of the
enzymes. In general it has been observed that α -amylase sequence motif have low sequence conservation than rest of the motifs of the GH13 family members.A large group of “Carbohydrate Active enzymes” that hydrolyse
polysaccharides have been divided into the glycoside hydrolase (GH) families
of the CAZy database [1] 
based on their amino acid sequence similarity.
Members of the GH13, GH70 and GH77 families, being part of the same clan
(GH-H), are believed to share a common ancestor and catalytic mechanism 
[2–5]. 
Further, these enzymes also share the A-, B- and C-domains. In addition to
α-(1→4)- and α-(1→6)-linkages, even α-(1→1)-, α-(1→2)- and α-(1→3)-
linkages are acted upon by members of the GH-H clan 
[6]. The enzymes of
GH13 family have a wide range of substrate specificities and catalytic
activities. This “polyspecificity” of the GH13 family has led to further division
of this family into 35 subfamilies [7]. Most of the subfamilies of GH13 are
apparently monospecific, however some also belong to polyspecific
subfamilies. Amylolytic enzymes with different substrate specificities have
poor overall sequence similarity in the domain A except for four regions of the
conserved residues [8–
10]. An evolutionary tree constructed on the basis of
these four conserved regions showed that α-(1→4)-hydrolases, α-(1→6)-
hydrolases and transferases form distinct groups [9].There are also regions wherein the sequence similarity is rather high; although
strict conservation of the residues is not observed in these regions. These are
region V (173LPDLD177), region VI (56GFTAIWITP64), and region VII
(323GIPIIYAGQ331; through out the introduction residue number is given
according to 6TAA (TAKA α-amylase), unless stated otherwise) 
[11]. Of these,
region V is at the C-terminus of the domain B of these enzymes. A sequence
analysis of 79 experimentally characterized proteins has suggested that the
signature sequence QpDln and MPKln (single letter amino acid symbols are
used; upper case letters indicate total conservation whereas lower case letters
indicate partial conservation) define the oligo-1,6-glucosidase and
neopullulanase subfamilies, respectively, in the region V. The signature
sequence MPDLN characterized the intermediary group which includes
enzymes with mixed specificities of α-amylase, cyclomaltodextrinase and
neopullulanase [12]. 
Currently, the catalytic triad residues Asp206, Glu230 and
Asp297 seem to be the only residues that are absolutely invariant among all the
GH-H clan members [11]. In addition, a few residues such as Gly56 and Pro64
[13] (flanking the second β-strand), Tyr82 
[13], His122 and His296 
[11] are
present in most of the members. However, Arg204 has been found to be
conserved only in the amylolytic members [6,
14].A larger number of residues are conserved within subgroups of enzymes such
as neopullulanases and oligo- α-1,6-glucosidases 
[12]. For example, Lys or Arg
are conserved at position 209 in 91“ of the α-(1→4)-linkage specific members
of the GH13 and GH77 family [06]. Similarly, Gly207 and His210 are present in
many α-(1→4)-linkage-specific enzymes. In some of the enzymes, Gly207 is
replaced by an aromatic residue and mimics the interactions of His210.
However, in case of archaeal and plant α-amylases His210 is replaced with a
Gly. Trp and Tyr/Phe are found at positions 231 and 232 in CGTases and one
maltogenic amylase but not in other GH13 family members 
[06]. Enzymes
which act on α-(1→6)-linkages (e.g., pullulanases, isoamylases, glycogen
debranching enzymes) have a conserved aromatic residue in the loop that links
the second β-strand and second helix. On the other hand, the enzymes that act
on α-(1→4)-linkages, have a conserved aliphatic residue in this position
(Ala120) suggesting that such regions provide the enzyme with a distinct
“activity” and/or “substrate” specificities. Certain fungal proteins of the GH13
family, some of which are involved in cell wall synthesis, share a few
conserved residues that are absent in α-amylases from other phyla (plant,
animals and bacteria) [15]. These residues are His (Thr41 in Taka-amylase),
Arg (Gly44), Cys (Thr66), Leu (Ala120), Tyr (Val231), Trp (Leu232), Cys
(Ile326) and Leu (Glu332). The sequence motifs that are responsible for the
reaction specificity of the enzymes of the GH13 family are not very well
understood. So, the identification of the sequence motif of α-amylase, CGTase,
branching enzymes and CDase subfamily of the GH13 family was performed.All these motifs are in continuation with the conserved region III and are in
almost same position with respect to each other. These sequence motifs belong
to the region that has not been explored so far, and include residue number 225
to 264. This analysis identifies sequence motif that is responsible for reaction
specificity of the GH13 family. The newly discovered sequence motif along
with the previous analyses of the structures of these enzymes 
[16,
17] will not
only help in the understanding of structure-function relationship of these
enzymes but also in the identification of the GH13 family members.The experimentally characterized sequences of the GH13 family were taken
from the UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org/) 
[18]. This analysis was
carried out on sequences retrieved from UniProt database in November 2008
and hence, the results of this analysis correspond to the database status of that
period. Multiple sequence alignment was performed by using the locally
installed T coffee (version 6.92) [19]. Multiple aligned sequences were
visualized by using BioEdit [20]. The conserved part of the aligned sequences
was used as a seed to generate the hidden Markov model (HMM) profile by
using hmmbuild module of the HMMER (version 2.3.2) [21] and hmmcalibrate
module used to calibrate E-value scores. The hmmsearch module was used to
search the Swiss-Prot database (4,00,771 sequences; version 56.4; 4 Nov.
2008) at E value cutoff of 0.1. Sequences having highest sequence similarity
with the profile were given a score and ‘Expect value’ (E) by HMMER
program. The E-value of a sequence with a score z indicates the number of
sequences that are expected to score z by chance, when searching a sequence
database with the given size. Sequence logos were created using WebLogo
(version 2.8.2) [22]. 
All parameters of different softwares had default values
unless specified.The analysis was performed on those members of the GH13 family that use the
α‐glucan as a substrate and produce disaccharides to polysaccharides as a final
product. 90% sequence identity cutoff option present on the UniProt database
(http://www.uniprot.org/) 
was used to retrieve the sequences and only reviewed
Swiss-Prot sequences for α‐amylase, branching enzyme and cyclodextrin
glycosyltransferase (CGTase) were selected. For CDase enzymes all the
reviewed Swiss-Prot entries were chosen, as the number of the sequences was
very low. Analysis was performed on the experimentally characterized
sequences rather than computationally annotated sequences (having larger size
of data set), because; despite of having high overall sequence similarity,
changes in key residues may confer different activity or no activity at all. All
the peptides and exceptionally large sequences were ignored to ensure the
proper alignment. This selection criteria lead to generation of the dataset
consisting of 59 α‐amylases, 12 CGTases, 166 branching enzymes, 3
maltogenic α‐amylases, 3 neopullulanases and 2 cyclomaltodextrinases
(CDase) (Supplementary Table 1 - available with author). The CDase,
neopullulanase and maltogenic α‐amylase enzymes are considered together in
CDase subfamily as these enzymes have similar enzymatic activities 
[23].The conserved region of α‐amylase, CGTase, branching enzyme and CDase
subfamily was obtained by multiple sequence alignment and was further used
for generation of sequence logos. The conserved region was selected by

region were kept same as far as possible. A sequence logo shows the relative
frequencies of the various residues at a given position. This is indicated by
proportionally varying the size of the symbol. The order of predominance of the
residues at a given position are indicated by showing the most frequently
occurring residue at the top of the heap and least frequently occurring residue at
the bottom of the heap. The height of the logo at a given position is
proportional to the degree of conservation at that position.Sensitivity is a parameter that reflects the ability of a profile to detect true
positive sequences, while specificity reflects their ability to reject false positive
sequences.
Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN), where TP is true positive, FN is false negative.
Specificity = TP/(TP+FP), where FP is false positive.The conserved region of α‐amylase, CGTase, branching enzyme and CDase are
present in equivalent position in the multiple sequence alignment
(Supplementary Figure 1 - available with author) and also includes conserved
region III. Some of the residues of these motifs constitute the −1 to +3
catalytic subsites in 3D structure of the enzymes (that is present within the
4.5Å from the ligand, data not shown).Searching by the HMM profile of α-amylase sequence motif against Swiss-Prot
database, the α-amylase enzymes with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of
99% were identified (Figure 1a). The four false positive hits included two
CGTases and two uncharacterized glycosyl hydrolases. The E-values of
CGTases are 0.0023 and 0.014; while that of uncharacterized glycosyl
hydrolases are 4.5e-05 and 0.0085. The results suggest that the similar
sequences present in both the α-amylase motif and false positive CGTases may
be responsible for the α-(1→4) hydrolytic activity. However, the role of these
residues needs to be experimentally investigated. The low E-value for the
uncharacterized glycosyl hydrolases hit indicates these enzymes to be α-
amylase. The sequence logo of this motif suggests that, besides catalytic
glutamate, this motif also contains three highly conserved residues (Glu, Arg
and Tyr and Trp as aromatic residue) that are absent in other enzymes at
equivalent positions. It has been seen that mutations in the α-amylase of
Bacillus stearothermophillus (A271Y, A271F) 
[25] and Bacillus licheniformis
(V271F) [26] 
(Figure 1a; {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P04745"",""term_id"":""1939884040""}}P04745 residue number, position 59 in sequence
logo) caused an increase in transglycosylation reaction as compared to the
wild-type enzymes. Interestingly, the mutant A271Y performed
transglycosylation reaction more efficiently than A271F. In case of human
salivary α-amylase the introduction of bulkier tryptophan residue in place of
Phe271 (Figure 1a; {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P04745"",""term_id"":""1939884040""}}P04745 residue number, position 59 in sequence logo)
caused a disruption of the water chain involved in hydrolysis leading to
reduction in hydrolytic activity by 70 folds [27]. Thus mutational analyses
suggest that residues of this motif may contribute to the hydrolytic activity in
α-amylases (Figure 1a).Sequence logo of (a) α‐amylase, (b) CGTase, (c) branching enzyme

the position of residues within the conserved region. The ordinates are in units
of bits and are indicative of the information content at each position (Schneider
& Stephens 1990) [24].CGTase specific motif was identified from 12 experimentally characterized
sequences. Searching by the HMM profile of CGTase sequence motif against
Swiss-Prot database, CGTase enzymes with sensitivity of 100% and specificity
of 89% were identified (Figure 1b). The lower specificity of this motif is due
to the two false positive hits (α‐amylase and maltogenic α‐amylase). Both of
these false positive hits have a very low E-value with 4.7e-28 for α‐amylase
and 3.2e-06 for maltogenic α‐amylase. However, the bit score for maltogenic
α‐amylase is low and aligns with the short stretch of the query motif. As
CGTase can perform both hydrolysis and transglycosylation reactions of α‐
(1→4) linked polysaccharide, it might have lead to picking of these false
positive hits. Maltogenic α‐amylase can efficiently catalyze both hydrolysis
and transglycosylation reactions, suggesting that the similar sequences in
CGTase motif and false positive maltogenic α‐amylase may be responsible for
hydrolytic and/or transglycosylation activity. The role of these residues needs
to be experimentally validated. The sequence logo of this motif shows the
presence of highly conserved sequence in different positions. Mutation,

(Figure 1b; {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P26827"",""term_id"":""1351937""}}P26827 residue

amylase activity [28] 
of CGTase. On the other hand, mutations in CGTase of
Bacillus stearothermophillus (F287I) 
[28–

[31],

number, position 9 in sequence logo) caused a decrease in cyclization and
disproportionation reactions along with increase in hydrolytic activity. These
mutational analyses suggest that these residues are central for cyclization
reaction [35]. The replacement of E292A 
(Figure 1b; {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""P26827"",""term_id"":""1351937""}}P26827 residue number,
position 18 in sequence logo) in Bacillus circulans strain 251 implies that this
residue may be involved in disproportionation reaction 
[32]. Thus, the above
mutational analyses suggest that this CGTase specific motif may be conferring
the reaction specificity in this enzyme.The sequence logo of 166 multiple aligned sequences show the presence of a
highly conserved sequence. On searching the HMM profile of branching
enzyme sequence motif against Swiss-Prot database, the branching enzymes
with a very high sensitivity and specificity of 100% were identified 
(Figure 1c). There are many residues like Ala, which are highly conserved and might
be responsible for the reaction specificity of the branching enzymes. Unlike
other enzymes where an aromatic residue or a hydrophobic residue is present
next to the catalytic Glu, the branching enzymes have an acidic residue like Glu
or Asp present. Thus, the conserved residues of this motif may be responsible
for the reaction specificity of the enzyme.CDase subfamily includes cylcomaltodextrinase (CDase), maltogenic α‐
amylase and neopullulanase. Despite of having different EC number, these
enzymes have similar enzymatic activities [23], and hence are treated together
in the present analysis. Searching by the HMM profile of CDase subfamily
sequence motif against Swiss-Prot database, the enzymes of CDase subfamily
with sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 53% were identified 
(Figure 1d).
The false positive hits include four amylopullulanase and one maltodextrin
glucosidase. The sequences similar in CDase motif and false positive
amylopullulanase may be responsible for the hydrolytic activity. I355W
(Figure 1d; Q08751residue number, position 8 in sequence logo) mutation in
the CDase of Bacillus stearothermophillus reduced the affinity of this enzyme
for α- (1→6) glycosidic linked substrate. It also lead to reaction specificity
similar to that of typical starch-saccharifying α-amylase 
[36]. However, I355V
mutant have high affinity for α- (1→6) glycosidic linked substrate. A mutation,
W356A, of Thermoactinomyces vulgaris neopullulanase II suggests that W356
(Figure 1d; Q08751residue number, position 9 in sequence logo) is crucial for
the binding of different substrate and it does so by making stacking interaction
[37]. 
However, to make this stacking interaction possible, Y374 residue is
required. The replacement of Y374A (Figure 1d; Q08751residue number,
position 36 in sequence logo) results in a decrease in Km value for the pullulan
as a substrate [38]. 
Y374 residue also helps in the hydrolysis of the different
substrates by providing catalytic water near the catalytic site. It has been
observed that on replacing Y374 with hydrophilic residue (D/S) in Bacillus
stearothermophillus neopullulanase, there was a decrease in transglycosylation.
Further, M372L and Y374F (Figure 1d; Q08751residue number, position 34
and 36 in sequence logo) mutants have been observed to have higher
transglycosylation activity than the wild-type enzyme 
[36]. Thus, above
mutational analyses clearly indicates that the residues of CDase motif may
govern the reaction specificities in enzymes of this subfamily.Sequence variation in the α‐amylase enzyme is higher as compared to rest of
the enzyme of GH13 family members. This may be due to the presence of α‐
amylase in diverse variety of organisms and it may have evolved earlier than
rest of the enzymes of the GH13 family. Thereby, during the evolution more
mutations may have occurred in α‐amylase to perform its activity in diverse
variety of biological systems or environment. As suggested by a number of
mutational studies the replacement of residues belonging to one motif with
sequence of another motif at equivalent positions may have changed the
reaction-specificities of the enzyme. Hence, these motifs can be used as a guide
for the inter-conversion of the GH13 family. Residues of these motifs
constitute the −1 to +3 catalytic subsites of the GH13 family members,
suggesting that these four subsites are mainly responsible for the reaction
specificities of the enzymes of the some of the GH13 family members.The author is grateful to University Grants Commission (UGC), India, for

PMC3084680,"Expression, stability, and replacement of glucan-remodeling enzymes during developmental transitions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae",False,"Sporulation is a developmental variation of the yeast life cycle whereby four spores are produced within a diploid cell, with proliferation resuming after germination. The GAS family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glucan-remodeling enzymes exemplifies functional interplay between paralogous genes during the yeast life cycle. GAS1 and GAS5 are expressed in vegetative cells and repressed during sporulation while GAS2 and GAS4 exhibit a reciprocal pattern. GAS3 is weakly expressed in all the conditions and encodes an inactive protein. Although Gas1p functions in cell wall formation, we show that it persists during sporulation but is relocalized from the plasma membrane to the epiplasm in a process requiring End3p-mediated endocytosis and the Sps1 protein kinase of the p21-activated kinase family. Some Gas1p is also newly synthesized and localized to the spore membrane, but this fraction is dispensable for spore formation. By way of contrast, the Gas2–Gas4 proteins, which are essential for spore wall assembly, are rapidly degraded after spore formation. On germination, Gas1p is actively synthesized and concentrated in the growing part of the spore, which is essential for its elongation. Thus Gas1p is the primary glucan-remodeling enzyme required in vegetative growth and during reentry into the proliferative state. The dynamic interplay among Gas proteins is crucial to couple glucan remodeling with morphogenesis in developmental transitions.The life cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a fascinating example of alternative modes of reproduction and development of a simple eukaryotic cell. Yeast cells can exist in genetically stable haploid or diploid states, and they reproduce asexually by budding. In addition, haploid cells of opposite mating type (a or α) can mate. In the absence of a nitrogen source and in the presence of a nonfermentable carbon source, the resulting diploid a/α cell enters the alternative pathway of meiosis and sporulation. This pathway consists of a round of DNA replication followed by two nuclear divisions (meiosis I and II), which culminate in the formation of four haploid nuclei, each representing a meiotic segregant. Then each nucleus is surrounded by a spore wall to generate mature spores, which remain inside the diploid cell, forming a structure called an ascus. The four haploid spores can be released from the asci by treatment with hydrolytic enzymes that remove the ascal wall. Finally, spores can germinate under favorable nutritional conditions and reenter the mitotic cycle or mate again and restore the diploid state.Over the years, the process of meiosis and sporulation has been studied in depth (Neiman, 2005 ). More recently a molecular characterization of the spore wall assembly pathway has been undertaken (Coluccio et al., 2004 ). The spore wall has a four-layer organization comprising from inside to outside 1) mannoproteins, 2) β(1,3)-glucan, 3) chitosan, and 4) dityrosine. The outer spore wall layers confer the spore much of its resistance to environmental stress. The deposition of spore wall components begins at the end of meiosis II when the prospore membrane (PSM) closure occurs. The PSM is a double membrane sac that originates from an initial priming structure, the meiotic outer plaque of the spindle pole body, to which the vesicles are redirected from the Golgi apparatus through a developmentally modified branch of the constitutive secretory pathway (Neiman, 1998 ; Morishita et al., 2007 ). The PSM extends progressively until it engulfs a haploid nucleus. The leading edges of the PSM fuse to form a double membrane compartment inside whose lumen spore wall material is deposited in a tightly regulated manner. At the end of the process, the outer membrane is dissolved. Spore germination is another important morphogenetic process. Under favorable conditions, nondividing haploid spores grow and reenter the mitotic cycle. At the germinating pole, a new wall with the typical three-layer organization of the vegetative cell wall—from inside to outside, chitin, glucan, and mannoprotein—is synthesized (Neiman, 2005 ).Gas proteins belong to family 72 of glucanases/transglycosidases (Cantarel et al., 2009 ). Their β(1,3)-glucanase/transglycosidase activity is crucial for the incorporation and remodeling of β(1,3)-glucan into the cell wall and for creating attachment sites for the anchoring of mannoproteins and chitin (Mouyna et al., 2000 ; Ragni et al., 2007b ; Rolli et al., 2009 ). In the S. cerevisiae genome, the GAS family is constituted by five paralogous genes: 1) GAS1 and GAS5, which are expressed during vegetative growth; 2) GAS2 and GAS4, which are repressed in vegetative growth and specifically induced during sporulation; and 3) GAS3, a weakly expressed gene encoding an inactive member of the family (Rolli et al., 2010 ). The Gas2 and Gas4 proteins are essential for proper spore assembly and viability (Ragni et al., 2007a ). Gas1p plays a major role in cell wall construction during vegetative growth, whereas Gas5p presumably plays an ancillary function. GAS1 mRNA is also four times more abundant than GAS5 mRNA (Rolli et al., 2010 ). Overexpression of GAS genes has no affect on the phenotype of vegetative or sporulating yeast cells. GAS products are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)–anchored proteins, and while Gas2p and Gas4p are poorly mannosylated, Gas1, Gas3, and Gas5 are highly mannosylated proteins (Ragni et al., 2007a , 2007b ; Rolli et al., 2010 ). Gas1p is predominantly anchored to the plasma membrane (PM) through GPI, but a fraction is also covalently linked to the cell wall (Yin et al., 2005 ). Accordingly, Gas1p localizes to microdomains of the PM, but it is also cross-linked to the chitin ring and bud scars, where it remains for many generations (Rolli et al., 2009 ). Moreover, at cytokinesis Gas1p localizes to the primary septum. At the bud neck and septum region, Gas1p is involved in the maintenance of the neck size and in cell separation (Rolli et al., 2009 ).Here we investigated the dynamic changes occurring in the localization of Gas1p during the yeast life cycle with a view to analyze the functional interplay among Gas paralogous proteins. Our results provide novel information about the dynamics of Gas proteins and the roles of glucan-remodeling enzymes during spore morphogenesis and germination.GAS1 and GAS5 mRNA levels were monitored in the strain AN120, derived from the sporulation-proficient strain SK-1 (Kane and Roth, 1974 ). Total RNA was extracted at different time intervals after the induction of sporulation and used for a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. Actin mRNA was chosen as a reference transcript because the expression of ACT1 does not fluctuate significantly in sporulating cells (Primig et al., 2000 ). As illustrated in Figure 1A, the GAS1 and GAS5 transcripts showed very similar profiles. They were detectable at time 0 and remained roughly constant until 6 h after induction of sporulation, when they started to decrease, and at 10 h the levels were reduced by more than fourfold. These results are in accordance with previous Northern hybridization and transcriptome analyses (Popolo et al., 1993a ; Chu et al., 1998 ; Primig et al., 2000 ).Time course of GAS1 and GAS5 transcription during meiosis and sporulation. (A) Cells were grown in YPD, precultured in YPA, and induced to sporulate in SPM. GAS1, GAS2, and GAS5 mRNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Relative mRNA levels are expressed as log2 of the ratio between the relative level at time 0 and the relative level at each subsequent time point. The CT values in the same experiment at time 0 for GAS1, GAS5, and GAS2 were respectively 23.8, 22.2, and 31.8. The percentages of sporulated cells were 0% (time 0), 12% (8 h), 58% (10 h), 70% (12 h), 80% (15 h), and 85% (20 and 24 h). (B) Levels of Gas1p during sporulation. Equal amounts of protein extracts (100 μg) were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Gas1p serum and anti-actin mAb. (C) Relative Gas1p levels during sporulation. Actin was used for normalization. The relative level at time 0 was set at 1. (D) Localization of the wild-type Gas1p to the spore periphery as determined by indirect immunofluorescence in AN120 cells at 24 h of sporulation. Bar: 3 μm.As an internal control, we compared the expression profiles of GAS1 and GAS5 with that of GAS2 as a representative member of the GAS2-GAS4 gene pair (Figure 1A). Consistent with a previous analysis, we detected a peak of expression at 7 h (Ragni et al., 2007a ). In conclusion, upon the induction of sporulation, either the expression of GAS1 and GAS5 is switched off and/or GAS1-GAS5 mRNAs are degraded.Total protein extracts were prepared at different time intervals after induction of sporulation and analyzed by immunoblot (Figure 1B). Gas1p was detected as a 130-kDa polypeptide. As shown in Figure 1B, the relative Gas1p level was constant throughout the sporulation process except for a slight increase in the first 10 h, which was probably due to completion of maturation of the precursors. The level of Gas1p remained constant during sporulation also in the W303 genetic background (Supplemental Figure S1). Thus the Gas1p present at time 0 appears to persist after the shift to the sporulation medium (SPM). Surprisingly, Gas1p was still detected at 45 h after sporulation induction, indicating that it is a highly stable protein (Figure 1, B and C). The persistence of Gas1p prompted us to examine its localization. As shown in Figure 1D, Gas1p was localized to the spore periphery in mature asci. In conclusion, although GAS1 transcription is repressed, the product persists over time and its localization changes.To study the localization of other Gas proteins during meiosis and sporulation, Gas2p was tagged with three hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes, whereas Gas4p was recognized by an anti-Gas4p serum. Sporulating cells were collected during sporulation and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. Gas2 and Gas4 proteins could be visualized only when overexpressed. Previous studies showed that their overexpression had no effect on sporulation (Ragni et al., 2007a ). At time 0, no fluorescence was detected (data not shown), in agreement with the absence of expression of GAS2 and GAS4 during vegetative growth (Ragni et al., 2007a ). During meiosis I, Gas2p-HA exhibited a diffuse fluorescence in the cytoplasm that was more intense around the two nuclei (Figure 2A, a–c), in agreement with the localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and PSM vesicle precursors (Neiman, 2005 ). During meiosis II, Gas2p-HA localized to elongated ellipsoidal structures corresponding to the newly assembled PSMs (Figure 2A, d–f). At the completion of meiosis II, Gas2p-HA expanded into ringlike structures, indicating an association with the PSMs (Figure 2A, g–i). Gas4p showed a similar localization pattern (Figure 2B). At the beginning of meiosis II, Gas4p had a diffuse and punctate pattern in the cytoplasm (Figure 2B, a–c). Some discrete foci concentrated around the nuclei and at the end of meiosis II eventually enlarged, outlining the spores (Figure 2B, d–f). The localization of Gas2p and Gas4p is in agreement with their role in the assembly of the glucan layer of the spore wall (Ragni et al., 2007a ).Gas2p-HA and Gas4p localization during meiosis and sporulation. (A) Gas2p-HA localization in cells at different stages of meiosis. Cells of strain ER314 (a gas2Δ diploid overexpressing GAS2-3xHA), pregrown in SA, were examined at 8 h of sporulation by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-HA mAb (red fluorescence). (B) Gas4p localization during meiosis II. A culture of strain ER316 (a parental strain overexpressing Gas4p) was sporulated at 30ºC, and cells were examined by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-Gas4p serum (green fluorescence). Images of DAPI staining (blue fluorescence), the immunofluorescence signal, and the merging of the two previous images are shown. Bar: 3 μm.Gas1p localization was analyzed in more detail by taking advantage of fluorescent versions of Gas1p. In Gas1p–green fluorescent protein (GFP), GFP was inserted internally to leave intact the N- and C-terminal signal sequences required for protein maturation. This hybrid has been shown to be partially functional in vegetative cells (Rolli et al., 2009 ). Whereas gas1Δ diploid cells harboring the wild-type GAS1 on a centromeric plasmid sporulated normally, those carrying the GAS1-GFP fusion on the same vector were unable to sporulate and displayed the defective phenotype of gas1Δ cells (discussed later in this article). In contrast, gas1Δ cells transformed with a multicopy plasmid harboring GAS1-GFP (strain ER335) fully complemented the phenotype, as shown by the high sporulation efficiency (∼95% in a shift from semidefined presporulation medium [SA] to SPM). Accordingly, the experiments were performed with strain ER335. At different time points after the induction of sporulation, cells were collected to analyze Gas1p-GFP localization. At time 0, Gas1p-GFP localized to the PM (Figure 3A, cell 1) and still labeled the PM at meiosis II (cell 2). At the completion of meiosis II, a remarkable change in Gas1p-GFP localization occurred: The fluorescence at the PM steadily started to decrease, and the protein was observed inside the cell (Figure 3A, cell 3). At later stages, a diffuse staining pattern was observed except for four round, black areas, corresponding to the developing spores, indicating that the fluorescence was excluded from these structures (Figure 3A, cell 4). In immature asci, only weak or no labeling was observed at the level of the PM of the mother cell and Gas1p-GFP was found between as well as around the spores (Figure 3A, cell 5). At 24 h, mature asci showed a bright Gas1p-GFP fluorescence in the epiplasm, which was compressed after the collapse of the wall on the spores (Figure 3A, cell 6). To determine whether the fluorescence was associated with the spores, asci were mildly treated with Zymolyase. As shown in Figure 3B, Gas1p-GFP decorated the spore periphery, indicating that the fluorescent labeling was associated with the spores. However, the fluorescence was less intense than in the intact ascus, suggesting that a fraction of Gas1p-GFP was lost during ascus wall digestion. Consistent with the removal of Gas1p-GFP from the mother PM during sporulation, the ascus ghosts were negative except for the presence of very bright rings (Figure 3C, right). These structures contained Gas1p-GFP cross-linked to the bud scars produced during vegetative growth (Rolli et al., 2009 ). Thus during sporulation the GPI-anchored Gas1p is completely removed from the PM of the mother cell and internalized, whereas the Gas1p cross-linked to the chitin of the bud scars remains static.Gas1p-GFP localization changes during sporulation. A gas1Δ/gas1Δ mutant expressing Gas1p-GFP (strain ER337) was shifted from SA to SPM and allowed to sporulate. (A) At different time points, sporulating cells were stained with DAPI and observed under a fluorescence microscope to detect both the DAPI and Gas1p-GFP fluorescence. Bar: 3 μm. (B) Spores released from the asci by treatment with Zymolyase at 24 h after the induction of sporulation. Bar: 3 μm. (C) An ascus ghost left after Zymolyase treatment of asci. No fluorescence is detectable except for the two bright rings corresponding to the Gas1p cross-linked to the bud scars. Bar: 5 μm.To exclude any artificial effect due to overexpression or type of fusion, we used a hybrid of Gas1p with the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP-Gas1p). In this chimera, mRFP was inserted immediately after the signal peptide and the hybrid protein was fully functional (Rolli et al., 2009 ). One copy of the fusion gene was integrated at the LEU2 locus in the W303 genetic background (strain WER375). During vegetative growth, mRFP-Gas1p showed the typical localization sites of Gas1p at the PM, bud neck (Figure 4A), and scars (not shown in the figure). During sporulation, mRFP-Gas1p was found inside the sporulating cells and around the prospores in addition to the PM staining that was detected in cells with not yet visible spores (Figure 4B). In mature asci, an intense staining was observed in the epiplasm (Figure 4C). The protein uniformly labeled the periphery of the released spores (Figure 4D). Thus both the relocalization of Gas1p from the PM to the epiplasm and the association to the spore periphery are independent of the fusion protein used and the genetic background. In addition, because the mRFP-GAS1 fusion was carried by only one parental strain, from which the diploid was generated and an equivalent partitioning of the hybrid protein to the spores was observed (fluorescent spores > 99%), we can conclude that transport of either the preexisting or the new synthesized protein could occur.mRFP-Gas1p localizes to the epiplasm and to the spore periphery. Diploid gas1Δ/GAS1 cells harboring a chromosomal copy of mRFP-GAS1 (strain WER375) were induced to sporulate by transfer from SA to SPM. Cells were observed by phase contrast (left) and fluorescence microscopy (right) at different time intervals. (A) Time 0: the fluorescent signal was visible at the PM, in the bud neck region (arrowhead) and in the vacuole of some cells (v). (B) At 9 h, sporulated cells show that mRFP-Gas1p fluorescence was throughout the cytoplasm, excluding the prospores (arrows). The fluorescence still labeled the PM in unsporulated cells. (C) At 24 h, the mRFP signal was between the spores. (D) Spores were released from mature asci by Zymolyase treatment. A fluorescent thin line surrounded the spores, indicating that mRFP-Gas1p was localized to the spore periphery. All the spores displayed a similar intensity, suggesting that partitioning of mRFP-Gas1p was equivalent. A vacuole was also visible inside the spores. Bar: 3 μm.To answer the question of the origin of the spore-associated Gas1p, the GAS1 promoter of the GAS1-GFP construct was replaced by the CLB2 promoter, which is repressed upon induction of sporulation. In this strain, the fate of the vegetative protein present at the PM can be analyzed without the interference of the protein that can be synthesized in the first hours of sporulation. In vegetative cells Gas1p-GFP was detected at the typical sites (Figure 5A). At 24 h of sporulation, a bright fluorescence was present around and between the spores (Figure 5B). However, no labeling was observed at the periphery of the released spores (Figure 5C). Taken together, these data support the idea that Gas1p localization at the spore depends on newly made protein, whereas the protein present at the PM during vegetative growth is transported to the cytoplasm but excluded from the developing spores.Gas1p-GFP associated to the spore periphery is newly synthesized. The strain ER374 harboring GAS1-GFP under CLB2 promoter was used to shut off the expression of GAS1-GFP upon induction of sporulation. At 24 h sporulated cells were ∼90–95%. Cells were observed by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy. (A) At time 0 Gas1p-GFP was localized to the PM and bud neck region. (B) At 24 h of sporulation, an intense GFP signal was seen inside the mature asci, around the spores (arrow). (C) After treatment of asci with Zymolyase, spores were released. No GFP signal at the spore periphery was observed. Bar: 3 μm.To confirm these results, we also examined the level of untagged Gas1p present in the epiplasm and spore extracts. Mature asci from a wild-type diploid strain (AN120) were treated with Zymolyase, and the soluble fraction (epiplasm) and extracts from the released spores were analyzed by immunoblot. As shown in Figure 6A, Gas1p was detected in both the epiplasm and the spores. A quantification from different experiments indicated that ∼30% of the wild-type protein present in the asci is associated with the spores. For a more accurate estimation, spores were purified by separation on density gradient (Esposito et al., 1991 ). Pure spores were washed with 0.5% Triton X-100 to disperse clumps and release any entrapped proteins as well as loosely bound proteins. Samples were analyzed by immunoblot using Fks2p, the β-glucan synthase of the spore membrane, as a marker. Fks2p was present at roughly the same level in the asci extract and in the pure spores, indicating that this protein is highly enriched in spores (Figure 6B, top). On the contrary, only ∼10% of the total Gas1 protein was recovered in the spore extract (Figure 6B, bottom). Thus Gas1p molecules localized to the spores represent a minor fraction of the total Gas1p present in the ascus.Gas1p associated to the spores is a minor fraction of the total Gas1p present in the ascus. Wild-type cells (AN120) were induced to sporulate by transfer from SA to SPM. (A) At 24 h efficiency of sporulation was ∼90–95%. Cells were treated with Zymolyase 20T to release spores as in Figure 3. The immunoblot showed the presence of Gas1p in total asci (lane 1), in spores (lane 2), and in the supernatant obtained after Zymolyase digestion (lane 3). The volume of loaded Zymolyase supernatant corresponded to the loaded amount of spores and asci extract. (B) A sporulated culture (efficiency ∼77%) was collected at 24 h and processed to isolate pure spores as described in Materials and Methods. Total extracts (∼100 μg proteins) from asci (lane 1) and from Triton X-100–washed purified spores (lane 2) were analyzed by immunoblot using anti-Fks2p antibodies and anti-Gas1p serum.We further examined whether the newly synthesized Gas1p was incorporated in the PSM. A colocalization analysis with GFP-Spo20p, a sporulation-specific member of the (SNAP25)-t-SNARE family that specifically marks the PSMs in developing spores, was performed (Neiman, 1998 ; Nakanishi et al., 2004 , 2006 ). Cells coexpressing mRFP-GAS1 and SPO2051–91-GFP were induced to sporulate. The Spo20p fragment contains the membrane localization signal but lacks the functional domain of Spo20p. During spore development, GFP-Spo20p resolved into ringlike structures representing the PSMs (Supplemental Figure S2). mRFP-Gas1p gave origin to a diffuse staining pattern in the cytoplasm in addition to a membrane labeling pattern overlapping that of Spo20p (Supplemental Figure S2, merge). These results support the existence of a pool of newly synthesized Gas1p molecules that are localized to the PSMs. A sufficient amount of protein is required to detect the fluorescence around the spores and to distinguish it from the cytoplasmic mRFP-Gas1p fluorescence.Internalization of GPI-anchored Gas1p could be mediated by endocytosis. Thus Gas1p-GFP localization was analyzed in an end3Δ mutant, which is defective in endocytosis. In this mutant, owing to a failure in the localization of the glucan and chitin synthase to the PSMs the deposition of glucan and chitosan layers does not occur (Morishita and Engebrecht, 2005 ). At 30°C, the sporulation efficiency of the end3Δ mutant was only ∼45% (n = 200), with an enrichment of asci with one, two, or three spores, in agreement with previously reported data (Morishita and Engebrecht, 2005 ). At 24 h after the induction of sporulation, Gas1p-GFP localized to the periphery of the spores and between the spores in the wild-type strain (Figure 7, a and a′), whereas it was mislocalized in the majority of end3Δ cells (Figure 7, b–f). Gas1p-GFP was detected mainly in the cytoplasm of abnormally shaped cells and excluded from the spores (Figure 7, b and b′). In some cells, Gas1p-GFP remained at the PM of the mother cells even when refractive spores were already visible (Figure 7, c–f). In ∼35% of the sporulated cells, Gas1p-GFP showed only a faint fluorescence on the spores, indicating that some new synthesis of the spore-associated protein occurred (Figure 7, e′ and d′). In conclusion, End3p-mediated endocytosis contributes to the efficient removal of Gas1p from the PM although other pathways are likely to be involved.Gas1p-GFP internalization is defective in end3Δ and sps1Δ mutants. The images show Gas1p-GFP expressed in the control strain (ER337), in an end3Δ mutant (ER351), and in an sps1Δ mutant (WER352) at 24 h after induction of sporulation. WT cells show the typical fluorescence around the spores (a and a′). The end3Δ cells show partially internalized Gas1p-GFP (b and b′, d and d′, e and e′, and f and f′) or Gas1p-GFP at the PM of the mother cells (c and c′). Moreover, in some spores a weak fluorescence around the spores was detectable, indicating that newly synthesized Gas1p properly localized in some spores (arrow in b′ and d′). The sps1Δ cells displayed Gas1p-GFP at the PM and a weak cytoplasmic fluorescence. In detail, differential interference contrast image (g), DAPI fluorescence (g′), and Gas1p-GFP fluorescence (g′′). Note the granular aspect of the cytoplasm. Bar: 3 μm.SPS1 encodes a sporulation-specific serine/threonine protein kinase with homology to members of the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) (Friesen et al., 1994 ; Park and Bi, 2007 ). It has previously been shown that sps1Δ mutants are not affected in the progression of meiosis or PSMs formation but form only aberrant spore-like compartments (Friesen et al., 1994 ; Iwamoto et al., 2005 ). Sps1p does not affect the developmentally regulated branch of the secretory pathway but regulates the trafficking of the enzymes involved in spore wall biogenesis to the PSMs (Iwamoto et al., 2005 ). To determine whether Gas1p internalization is regulated by Sps1p, we analyzed Gas1p localization during sporulation in an sps1Δ null diploid mutant. Gas1p-GFP fluorescence was detected in the PM in most cells that had completed meiosis II, and it was also slightly diffused throughout the cytoplasm, although it was never observed at the PSMs or in spore-like compartments (Figure 7, g–g′′). Thus the sps1Δ mutant appears to be defective in triggering the internalization step of PM-associated Gas1p-GFP.The presence of a fraction of Gas1p in the spore suggests a potential involvement of the protein in spore wall assembly or in subsequent germination. We first examined the effect of GAS1 inactivation on sporulation. The phenotypic analysis of gas1Δ/gas1Δ cells during sporulation was complicated by the fact that the mutant was unable to grow in presporulation media containing acetate as a carbon source. Cells appeared swollen and underwent lysis. A spot assay on solid medium indicated that the viability of gas1Δ/gas1Δ cells was very low on acetate, glycerol, and ethanol with respect to glucose (Supplemental Figure S3). Thus gas1Δ phenotype is worsened in the presence of nonfermentable carbon sources. This defect was common to gas1/gas1 null mutants derived from SK-1 or W303 genetic backgrounds (Supplemental Figure S3). In an attempt to prevent growth defects of gas1Δ/gasΔ cells, 1 M sorbitol was included in SA as an osmotic stabilizer. Under this condition, cells grew slowly (duplication time of ∼8 h), and the lysis phenotype of the mutant was partially mitigated (Figure 8A). To induce sporulation, cells were shifted to SPM supplemented with 1 M sorbitol. Both the mutant and the isogenic strain completed the process in 48 h. The sporulated population of mutant cells was composed of asci of different sizes, many lysed cells forming large aggregates, and also multispore asci (Figure 8B). The sporulation efficiency of the gas1Δ mutant was ∼36%, whereas in the wild type it was ∼78% (Table 1). Thus the defects carried on from vegetative growth on acetate affect the morphology and sporulation efficiency of the gas1Δ mutant.Phenotype of gas1Δ/gas1Δ sporulating cells. (A) The gas1Δ/gas1Δ cells (strain ER320) growing exponentially in SA with 1 M sorbitol (time 0). In the inset, the morphology of a wild-type cell (strain AN120). (B) The gas1Δ/gas1Δ cells at 24 h after the shift to SPM, supplemented with 1 M sorbitol. In the inset, a wild-type ascus is shown. A multispore ascus (m) is indicated (arrow). (C) Microscopic analysis of intact asci for the study of the coherence of the dityrosine layer in the presence of 1 M sorbitol. (D) Septin organization is normal in gas1Δ/gas1Δ sporulating cells. Bar: 3 μm.Yeast plasmids used in this study.To check whether mutant spores were affected in spore wall maturation, the dityrosine layer was analyzed. The gas1Δ mutant showed normal dityrosine accumulation and deposition, suggesting cells undergoing sporulation have a normal deposition of the cell wall, including the outermost layer (Figure 8C). Accordingly, we monitored the organization of septins, a cytological marker of spore formation. Septins are organized at the leading edge of the PSM and facilitate spore wall deposition (Fares et al., 1996 ). Their localization is altered in mutants in which PSM closure is not sensed or has failed (Tachikawa et al., 2001 ). The localization of Spr28p, a sporulation-specific septin and a marker of PSM closure, was examined (De Virgilio et al., 1996 ). The septins formed parallel bar structures and then eventually surrounded the spores in the wild type (Figure 8D, left). An analogous pattern was observed in gas1Δ cells, suggesting that septins are properly organized in the absence of Gas1p (Figure 8D, right). Thus PSMs undergo closure in the gas1Δ mutant. In conclusion, Gas1p does not play any appreciable role during spore morphogenesis and spore wall assembly.A striking phenotypic trait of the gas1Δ/gas1Δ mutant was the presence of asci with more than four nucleate spores (Table 1, Figure 8B). This trait could be explained by the presence of ∼3% of bi- and trinucleate cells during vegetative growth, probably derived from endomitosis caused by the cell wall defects (unpublished data). Hence, multispore asci were the meiotic products of these cells.Because Gas1p appears to play a dispensable role in spore wall assembly, we analyzed its possible involvement in germination. Spore germination consists of the exit from quiescence and adaptation to the new nutritional condition, followed by the entry into the proliferative state (Joseph-Strauss et al., 2007 ). Asci were collected after 24 h of sporulation and treated with Zymolyase, and the released spores were induced to germinate. As shown in Figure 9, at time 0 Gas1p-GFP uniformly decorated the spore periphery. One hour later, Gas1p-GFP was still localized to the spore periphery. At 2 h, the protein concentrated in one part of the spore, with a crescent-like aspect. Notably, the fluorescent protein marked the site of growth polarization. As germination proceeded, the Gas1p-GFP signal was almost undetectable in the nongrowing half, and it concentrated in the growing half as a bright crescent (3 h). At 4 h, bud emergence was observed, and Gas1p-GFP was still highly polarized and decorated the periphery of small new buds. From this stage, it was possible to recognize the Gas1p-GFP localization pattern typical of vegetative growth (Rolli et al., 2009 ) (5 h). These results confirm that Gas1p is polarized toward the side undergoing active cell wall growth. Interestingly, when the bud reached its final size but before cytokinesis, the “mother spore” appeared to undergo lysis and resembled an empty sac (see arrow in Figure 9, 7 h). Overall, these findings suggest the involvement of dynamic changes in the localization of Gas1p in the morphological transitions occurring during spore germination.Dynamics of Gas1p-GFP localization during spore germination. The gas1Δ/gas1Δ mutant cells expressing Gas1p-GFP (strain ER337) were shifted from SA to SPM and allowed to sporulate for 24 h. The percentage of sporulation was ∼92%. Spores were released by Zymolyase treatment. Time 0 indicates the moment of transfer of the spores in YPD at 30°C. At 7 h, the arrow indicates a spore ghost that died after having produced a vegetative cell.We next analyzed the effects of the loss of Gas1p during spore germination. Wild-type and gas1Δ spores were released from the ascus and induced to germinate. As shown in Figure 10A, at time 0 no significant morphological difference could be detected between the parental and gas1Δ spores. At 1 h, the spores were still round. From 2 to 7 h, polarized growth became progressively more evident in the wild type, with the presence of elongated cells, whereas gas1Δ spores maintained their round shape. Also, the buds that emerged from gas1Δ cells at later times (5–7 h) were rounder than the wild-type buds. These morphological defects are in agreement with the previously described phenotypic traits of the mutant during vegetative growth (Popolo et al., 1993b ) and support a primary role for Gas1p in determining cell shape.Germinating gas1Δ spores are defective in the elongation of the outgrowth portion. (A) Time course of the morphological changes of germinating wild-type and gas1Δ spores in YPD at 30°C. (B) Elongation of the spores at different time intervals during germination. Plots report the length of the long and short axes at different time intervals during germination. At least 20 spores were measured for each strain, and the data are shown as mean (μm) ± SD. ▪, long axis; □, short axis.A quantitative analysis of gas1Δ defects in germination was performed by measuring the length of the long and short axes of the germinating spores (Figure 10B). The longest segment along the direction of growth was defined as the long axis, while the short axis was taken as the longest segment in a direction perpendicular to the long axis. As shown in Figure 10B, in wild-type cells the long and short axes started to increase at 2 h, but the long axis increased more rapidly than the short one, in good agreement with previously published data (Kono et al., 2005 ). In the mutant, both the long and short axes remained more or less constant over the first 2 h, after which they increased slightly until reaching approximately the same length. For the wild type, the long:short axis ratio was 1.19 ± 0.15 at time 0 and increased to a value of 1.6 ± 0.28 at 7 h, whereas for the mutant it was 1.12 ± 0.24 at time 0 and 0.99 ± 0.17 at 7 h. These results indicate that Gas1p plays a pivotal role in cell elongation in the early stages of spore germination (2–3 h). At the time of bud appearance and during bud maturation (5–7 h), Gas1p is still remarkably implicated in growth polarization.To study the dynamic relationships among Gas1, Gas2, and Gas4 proteins, the ER314 strain was induced to sporulate. We took advantage of this strain to simultaneously detect wild-type Gas1 and Gas4 proteins and Gas2p-HA, the latter being expressed from a high-copy plasmid. As shown in Figure 11A, the Gas2-3xHA and Gas4 proteins were absent in vegetative growing cells and were present at 8 h after induction of sporulation, in agreement with the time of the maximal expression (7 h) of GAS2 and GAS4 genes (Ragni et al., 2007a  and Figure 1A). At 24 h, Gas4p was undetectable, whereas Gas2p-3xHA was still present but its level was reduced. Next Gas2p-3xHA and Gas4p levels were monitored during germination. Gas4p was absent, whereas Gas2p-3xHA decreased steadily over time. In contrast, the level of Gas1p persisted during sporulation and increased during germination (Figure 11A). These results point to a lack of new synthesis and the concomitant degradation of Gas2 and Gas4 proteins during sporulation and early germination (see Discussion). Moreover, the results show that wild-type Gas1p persists during sporulation and early germination and its level increases rapidly upon entry in germination, consistent with the induction of GAS1 transcription by transfer from SPM to yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) (see Discussion).Gas1, Gas2-3xHA, and Gas4 protein levels during sporulation and germination and in old asci. (A) At time 0, cells of strain ER314 growing exponentially in SA at 30°C were shifted to SPM. After 24 h of sporulation, asci were collected. The release of the spores took ∼0.5 h. At 1-h intervals from the transfer of the spores to YPD at 30°C, total protein extracts were prepared and equivalent amounts of proteins (100 μg) were analyzed by immunoblot. The levels of endogenous Gas1 (130 kDa) and Gas4 (54 kDa) proteins and of the overexpressed Gas2-3xHA (64 kDa) are shown. The 100-kDa ER precursor of Gas1p is also detectable during germination (asterisk). (B) Wild-type cells (strain AN120) were grown in two different presporulation media at 30°C, and at time 0 they were shifted to SPM. After 48 h the cultures were kept static for several weeks at 20°C. Total proteins extracts were prepared and equivalent amounts of proteins (100 μg) analyzed by immunoblot. An extract from a gas1 null mutant was loaded as a negative control. (A) Cells were pregrown in YPA. (B) Cells were pregrown in SA.To explore the physiological significance of the persistence of Gas1p in the mature ascus, we examined the levels of Gas1p during aging of the spores. Wild-type cells were pregrown either in yeast peptone acetate (YPA) or in SA and then induced to sporulate in SPM. At 48 h sporulated cultures were kept static at 20°C for several weeks. Figure 11B shows that the level of Gas1p from YPA cells did not change until 24 h of sporulation. A quantification of the relative levels using actin for normalization indicated that from 48 h to 4 wk Gas1p was present at a level corresponding to ∼60–70% of the protein present at time 0, indicating that Gas1p slowly decays in the asci. Figure 11C shows that Gas1p from SA-grown cells had a faster kinetics of decay. At 24 h the residual fraction was ∼60% the amount of Gas1p present at time 0, and from 48 h to 4 wk the protein steadily decreased until reaching a value of ∼10% the amount present at time 0. Thus Gas1p has a high stability in asci from cells pregrown in YPA, whereas the protein appears less stable in asci derived from cells pregrown in SA. Spores from 4-wk-old asci, both from YPA or SA, were still able to germinate, indicating that they were viable (data not shown). Interestingly, actin appears to be a long-lived protein because its level was unaffected in both conditions.Multigene families offer a good model to study the interplay among paralogous proteins and their interactions for the fine-tuning of different biological processes. One such family is the Gas family of S. cerevisiae. Gas2 and Gas4 isoforms replace the vegetative Gas1 and Gas5 proteins in glucan remodeling during spore wall formation. Consistently, Gas2p and Gas4p are essential for spore wall formation, suggesting that Gas1p and Gas5p cannot compensate for their absence (Ragni et al., 2007a ). In this work, we demonstrate that Gas1 protein persists during sporulation, but its localization changes. The fluorescent Gas1 protein marked the PM of the diploid cell but was relocalized to the epiplasm of the ascus. The PM-epiplasm transport of the protein seems a rather late event, probably beginning at the end of meiosis II and after PSM closure, as suggested by the exclusion of the fluorescence from the developing prospores. Additionally, in mature asci, Gas1p (∼10% of the total) was also associated to the PM of the spores. The spore-associated Gas1p is newly made. The synthesis probably occurs during early sporulation, taking into account that a steady-state level of transcript is present until 6 h of sporulation. This protein is probably processed through the secretory pathway and equally distributed to the PSMs, as suggested by the experiment performed with the integrated copy of mRFP-GAS1 (Figure 4).Overall, the formation of the spore wall requires a specific set of enzymes, some of which are reused from vegetative growth while others are replaced by sporulation-specific isoforms. Moreover, spatial and temporal regulation of protein trafficking is crucial for proper spore formation. Remarkably, Fks1p, the predominant vegetative form of the β(1,3)-glucan synthase during growth on glucose, is replaced by Gsc2p/Fks2p (Ishihara et al., 2007 ). GSC2/FKS2 expression is induced during sporulation (Mazur et al., 1995 ). Gsc2/Fks2p reaches the PM before being recycled to the PSMs (Morishita and Engebrecht, 2005 ). Similarly to Fks proteins, Gas2p and Gas4p replace Gas1p function in spore wall assembly and are degraded after execution of their function (Figure 11A). With regard to chitosan synthesis, CHS3, encoding the catalytic subunit of chitin synthase III and responsible for the synthesis of chitosan (Pammer et al., 1992 ), is not transcriptionally up-regulated during sporulation, but the protein is recycled (Iwamoto et al., 2005 ), and this is consistent with the notion of it being an enzyme that is mainly regulated at the posttranslational level (Choi et al., 1994 ; Valdivia and Schekman, 2003 ). On the contrary, its activator, Chs4p, is quickly degraded upon induction of sporulation and is replaced by the sporulation-specific Shc1p, which is also directed to the PSMs (Sanz et al., 2002 ; Iwamoto et al., 2005 ).Interestingly, in recent years END3-mediated endocytosis has been shown to play an important role in membrane trafficking events required for spore wall formation (Morishita and Engebrecht, 2005 ). Chs3p and Gsc2p/Fks2p require End3p for their relocalization to the PSMs. In the present work, we demonstrate that in the absence of End3p, Gas1p is also inefficiently internalized. Thus a partially common mechanism could mediate the transport of Gas1p, Chs3p, and Gsc2p inside the sporulating cell, although the destiny of Gas1p is different from that of Chs3p and Gsc2p, with the latter being diverted to the PSMs while Gas1p is sequestered in the epiplasm.Internalization of Gas1p-GFP also requires the activity of the Sps1 PAK kinase, as also reported for Chs3p, Shc1p, and Gsc2p/Fks2p (Iwamoto et al., 2005 ). The defect has been attributed to failure in the intracellular movement because endocytosis appears normal in the sps1Δ mutant (Iwamoto et al., 2005 ). PAK kinases are activated by the small G-protein Cdc42p (Zhao and Manser, 2005 ; Perez and Rincon, 2010 ). In yeast, the best known members are Ste20p, Cla4p, and Skm1p. Once activated, PAK kinases regulate downstream effectors that play a crucial role in cytoskeleton dynamics, pheromone response, cell cycle, and gene transcription. In addition, another protein kinase, the Smk1p mitogen-activated protein kinase, controls the transition between the deposition of the inner and outer layers of the spore wall by negatively regulating Fks2p. There is evidence that Sps1p and Smk1p have distinct functions (Ufano et al., 1999 ; Neiman, 2005 ). Because no effector of Sps1p is known, it may be surmised that Sps1p would regulate a crucial step in actin cytoskeleton remodeling required for the endocytic pathway of Gas1p. Alternatively, because the sps1Δ mutant lacks proper coordination between the end of meiosis II and nuclear engulfment, and this causes defects in cell wall formation and transcription, it may be proposed that the same signal would trigger the mobilization of Gas1p.Interestingly, dynamic changes have also been described for septins (Cdc3p, Cdc10p, Cdc11p, Cdc12p, and Shs1p). During sporulation CDC12 is repressed, but the premade protein persists, although in the creation of the new structures Cdc12p is replaced by the sporulation-specific septin Spr3p. On germination, only newly synthesized Cdc12 molecules are used for the creation of new structures. By contrast, Cdc10p synthesized during vegetative growth is reutilized to build sporulation-specific structures and then reused again during spore germination (McMurray and Thorner, 2008 , 2009 ). Thus tracking the fate of molecules along the yeast life cycle is becoming a fascinating area of yeast cell biology.The presence of Gas1p at the spore periphery suggests that in addition to its role during vegetative growth, Gas1p might be involved in spore wall assembly. For instance, the cross-linking of the β(1,3)-glucan and chitosan layers could require an increase in the branching level of the glucan or in the length of the branches, and hence different proteins of the GH72 family might become necessary. However, the phenotype of gas1Δ/gas1Δ mutants in sporulation indicates that Gas1p plays a dispensable role in spore morphogenesis in S. cerevisiae. Thus the removal of Gas1p from the PM could be necessary to soften the cell wall of the diploid cell in preparation for its collapse on the spores. Indeed, the ascus wall is less resistant than the vegetative cell wall (Coluccio et al., 2008 ).Our finding that the rich presporulation medium YPA supports greater stability of wild-type Gas1p than semidefined SA medium also suggests that in the asci Gas1p is slowly degraded at a rate that is dependent on the nutritional state of the diploid cells that generated them.Germination can be divided into distinct stages: the uncoating of the spore wall (1 h), polarized growth (2 h), isotropic growth (3 h), and bud emergence (4 h) (Joseph-Strauss et al., 2007 ). Here we show that Gas1p is essential for growth polarization during germination. In addition, Gas1p-GFP was found to be highly polarized to the growing half of the germinating spores. To check when GAS1 or GAS5 transcription was reactivated, we explored the transcriptome of spore germination (Joseph-Strauss et al., 2007 ). Owing to technical problems, GAS1 was not present in the database (M. Barkai, personal communication). Interestingly, GAS5 transcription increased very rapidly and reached a maximum within the first 2 h of germination (Joseph-Strauss et al., 2007 ). Because the present and previous studies indicate that GAS1 and GAS5 share a common pattern of transcription, it may be assumed that GAS1 is also similarly induced during early germination. The lack of elongation in germinating gas1Δ spores points to a primary role of Gas1p in coupling the events required for growth polarization with cell wall biogenesis.Although the induction of GAS1 and GAS5 transcription seems to be rapid, protein synthesis and maturation may delay the appearance of newly synthesized enzymes, in particular because Gas1 protein is abundantly modified by N- and O-mannosylation and by GPI attachment. Thus the spore-associated Gas1p could supply some activity at the onset of spore germination before the new molecules become available.The strains are listed in Table 2. Cells were routinely grown at 30°C in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 2% glucose) or in synthetic dextrose minimal medium (Difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acids at 6.7 g/l, 2% glucose) to which the required supplements were added at concentrations of 50 mg/l for the amino acids and uracil and 100 mg/l for adenine. To induce sporulation, logarithmic cultures were shifted from YPD to YPA (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 2% acetate) or to semidefined presporulation medium (SA) (10 g potassium acetate, 6.7 g yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 1 g yeast extract in 1 l of 0.05 M phthalate buffer, pH 5) at an initial optical density of 0.2 OD450. Cells were grown at 30°C, collected the following morning, and washed with sterile dH2O before being shifted to SPM (1% potassium acetate) at a cell density of ∼107 cells/ml (OD450 between 1 and 1.5) at a 1:10 ratio of culture volume to flask volume. Cultures were allowed to sporulate under vigorous shaking at 30ºC. The percentage of sporulation was ∼75–85% when cells were pregrown in YPA and ∼95% when pregrown in SA. Spore purification was performed as previously described (Esposito et al., 1991 ). To induce germination, a 10-ml aliquot of a sporulated culture was harvested, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2), and then resuspended in PBS containing 20 μg/ml Zymolyase 20T (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Cells were incubated for 15 min at 37ºC to release the spores. Then the samples were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in YPD at a final concentration of 1–2 × 107 cells/ml, and allowed to germinate at 30ºC. For the release of gas1Δ spores, ascus digestion was performed in PBS containing 4 μg/ml Zymolyase 20T. To obtain old asci, cultures at 48 h of sporulation were kept static at 20°C for several weeks. To check spore germination, spores were resuspended in YPD at 30°C and increase in OD450 was monitored.Effects of GAS1 deletion on sporulation.aValues are expressed as means ± SD of data obtained from three independent experiments at 48 h after the induction of sporulation.Total RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, and real-time PCR were performed as previously described (Ragni et al., 2007a ). The primer pairs for GAS1 and GAS5 were GAS1 forward 5′-AGGTAGTGTTGATTTGGGTTCC and gas1reverse 5′-AGAAGACCCCGAAGCGTTA; GAS5 forward 5′-TCCTCGACTTCAAAGGCATC and GAS5 reverse 5′-ATGCGGCAGATTTTAGCAAG. In the case of ACT1 and GAS2, the primers have been described previously (Ragni et al., 2007a ). Each cDNA was assayed in at least duplicate PCRs for two independent experiments. Basic analysis was performed using SDS 1.9.1 software (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). For further elaboration of the data, the Livak method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 ) was used. Briefly, from each duplicate reaction, a ΔCT was calculated by subtracting the average cycle threshold (CT) value of ACT1 from the average CT value of the gene of interest for the same time. Then the difference between the ΔCT at any time and the ΔCT at time 0 was calculated (ΔΔCT). The plotted values are 2-ΔΔCT.The plasmids are listed in Table 3. pRS426-mRFP-GAS1 was constructed by cloning the SacI-BamHI fragment from pMF608, kindly provided by Y. Jigami (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan) and described previously (Rolli et al., 2009 ), into similarly cut pRS426. To place the GAS1-GFP fusion under the control of the CLB2 promoter (PCLB2), the BamHI/SmaI fragment of YEp24-GAS1-GFP containing the GAS1-GFP cassette (including GAS1 promoter and terminator) was cloned in pRS416, generating pRS416-GAS1-GFP. Then the GAS1 promoter was swapped with the PCLB2 by cloning the 1-kb DNA fragment of the −1000/−1 CLB2 region upstream from the GAS1 coding sequence. The pRS416-PCLB2-GAS1-GFP was obtained. The DNA fragment was generated by PCR using the SK-1 genomic DNA as template and the primers CLB2Prom-SmaI (GCTACTCCCGGGACCCTGTTCTTGACCGTC, SmaI restriction site underlined, CLB2 sequence −1000/−983 in italics) and CLB2Prom-BstAPI (AAAAAGCAGCAGCGGTTGCTAACTTTGAAAGGGATTTAAACAACATCTATAAGATCAATGAAGA, BstAPI restriction site underlined, CLB2 sequence −18/−1 in italics, GAS1 coding sequence +1/+46 in bold). Finally, the SmaI-BamHI fragment of pRS416-PCLB2-GAS1-GFP containing PCLB2-GAS1-GFP was transferred into a similarly cut YEp24 to create YEp24-PCLB2-GAS1-GFP.S. cerevisiae strains used in this work.Cells were observed by phase-contrast microscopy, and sporulation was scored by counting at least 200 cells after a mild sonication. For Gas1p-GFP visualization, 1 ml sporulating culture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 2 min at 4°C, washed twice with cold PBS, and incubated for 15 min on ice. If required, 8.3 μg/ml 4,6-diamidine-phenylindole (DAPI) was added to the cells. Samples were then incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark before microscopy observation. Cells were observed as wet mounts using an Eclipse 90i (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) or a DMRXA (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) microscope equipped with epifluorescence, Nomarski optics, and a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (Nuhsbaum, McHenry, IL). The setup, including the microscope and camera, was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Alternatively, cells were examined with an Olympus BX60 microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a DC290 Kodak digital camera. The images were analyzed using ImageJ-BMF software (McMaster Biophotonics Facility, Hamilton, ON, Canada) and Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA). The observation of the natural fluorescence of dityrosine was performed as described previously (Briza et al., 1986 ).For indirect immunofluorescence, sporulating cells (20 OD450) were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde–0.1 M KPO4 buffer for 30 min. After a 3-min centrifugation at 1500 rpm, the cells were resuspended in the same volume of fixing solution (0.1 M KPO4, 3.7% formaldehyde) for 2–4 h. Fixed cells were washed and resuspended in SHA buffer (1 M sorbitol, 0.1 M HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, and 5 mM NAN3) at a concentration of 108 cells/ml. A small aliquot of fixed cells (150 μl) was centrifuged and resuspended in SHA supplemented with 25 μg/ml Zymolyase 20T (ICN Biomedicals) and 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol. After a 30-min incubation at 37ºC, removal of the ascus sac was checked before proceeding. Spheroplasts were then permeabilized by incubating in SHA and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After attaching to glass slides, cells were plunged into −20°C methanol for 6 min, followed by −20°C acetone for 30 s. After a blocking step in PBS + block (1% milk, 0.5% bovine serum albumin [BSA] in PBS) for 10 min, slides were incubated in primary antibody diluted in PBS + block for 2 h. Primary antibodies were anti-Gas1p rabbit serum (diluted 1:500), anti-HA monoclonal antibody (mAb) (diluted 1:1000; Covance, Berkeley, CA), and anti-Gas4p serum. Rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig) G was purified from anti-Gas4p serum using a protein A microspin column and diluted 1:50. Slides were washed 12 times with PBS + 0.5 mg/ml BSA and then incubated in Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti–mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti–rabbit IgG (1:1500 dilution) for 1 h. After 12 washes with PBS, or with PBS–0.5% BSA–0.1% Triton X-100 for Gas4p, a mounting media (Gel Mount; Biomeda Corporation, Foster City, CA) was added to the slides, which were kept at 4ºC for 1 h and observed under an epifluorescence microscope.Sporulating cells (2 × 108) were collected by filtration, washed, and resuspended in ice-cold dH2O. After a 2-min centrifugation at 4°C, the pellet was rapidly frozen and stored at −20°C. Extract preparation, determination of protein concentrations, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (Gatti et al., 1994 ; Ragni et al., 2007a ). Anti-Gas1p serum, anti-actin, or anti-HA mAbs and an anti-Gas4p serum, diluted 1:1000, were used (Rolli et al., 2009 ). Peroxidase-conjugated, affinity-purified F(ab′)2 fragment donkey anti–rabbit or anti–mouse IgG were used (1:10,000 dilution; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Bound antibodies were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Densitometry measurements were performed using the Scion Image program (Scion, Frederick, MD).The authors thank Roberto Cavatorta for the preparation of the figures and Nic Skinner for English revision of the manuscript, Aaron Neiman and JoAnne Engebrecht for plasmids and strains, the Unidad de Genómica–Universidad Complutense de Madrid/Parque Científico de Madrid for help with the qRT-PCR, and Concetta Compagno for helpful discussions.

PMC3091093,"Molecular Analysis of a Family of Arabidopsis Genes Related to Galacturonosyltransferases1,[W][OA]",False,"We are studying a Galacturonosyltransferase-Like (GATL) gene family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that was identified bioinformatically as being closely related to a group of 15 genes (Galacturonosyltransferase1 [GAUT1] to -15), one of which (GAUT1) has been shown to encode a functional galacturonosyltransferase. Here, we describe the phylogeny, gene structure, evolutionary history, genomic organization, protein topology, and expression pattern of this gene family in Arabidopsis. Expression studies (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) demonstrate that all 10 AtGATL genes are transcribed, albeit to varying degrees, in Arabidopsis tissues. Promoter::β-glucuronidase expression studies show that individual AtGATL gene family members have both overlapping and unique expression patterns. Nine of the 10 AtGATL genes are expressed in all major plant organs, although not always in all cell types of those organs. AtGATL4 expression appears to be confined to pollen grains. Most of the AtGATL genes are expressed strongly in vascular tissue in both the stem and hypocotyl. Subcellular localization studies of several GATL proteins using yellow fluorescent protein tagging provide evidence supporting the Golgi localization of these proteins. Plants carrying T-DNA insertions in three AtGATL genes (atgatl3, atgatl6, and atgatl9) have reduced amounts of GalA in their stem cell walls. The xylose content increased in atgatl3 and atgatl6 stem walls. Glycome profiling of cell wall fractions from these mutants using a toolkit of diverse plant glycan-directed monoclonal antibodies showed that the mutations affect both pectins and hemicelluloses and alter overall wall structure, as indicated by altered epitope extractability patterns. The data presented suggest that the AtGATL genes encode proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis, but their precise roles in wall biosynthesis remain to be substantiated.Plant cell walls are composed mostly of networks of polysaccharides, primarily cellulose, pectins, and hemicelluloses. The synthesis of these polysaccharides requires a significant commitment of the plant’s genomic resources; perhaps as many as 10% of genes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) have been estimated to be involved in plant cell wall synthesis, maintenance, modification, and degradation (Carpita et al., 2001). Many of these genes belong to multigene families (Henrissat et al., 2001) whose individual members have distinct patterns of expression among plant cells and tissues (Taylor et al., 1999, 2000; Fagard et al., 2000; Peng et al., 2000; Sarria et al., 2001; Williamson et al., 2001; Orfila et al., 2005; Burton et al., 2006; Harholt et al., 2006; Peña et al., 2007; Persson et al., 2007). At least 50 glycosyltransferases (GTs) are predicted to be required for pectin synthesis (Ridley et al., 2001). Recently, several putative GTs that may be involved in the biosynthesis of different pectins have been identified using mutational and/or biochemical approaches. These include three members from the CAZy (Cantarel et al., 2009) family GT47, two members from family GT77, and two members from family GT8. Specifically, these genes are: ARAD1 (GT47), which is believed to encode an α-l-arabinosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of arabinan side chains of rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I; Harholt et al., 2006); XGD1 (GT47), which encodes a β-(1,3)-xylosyltransferase possibly involved in xylogalacturonan synthesis (Jensen et al., 2008); NpGUT1 (GT47), involved in RG-II side chain synthesis in tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia) as a putative glucuronosyltransferase (Iwai et al., 2002), although mutants in orthologous genes in Arabidopsis evidence xylan defects (Brown et al., 2009; Séveno et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2009); RGXT1 and RGXT2 genes (GT77), which may participate in the synthesis of side chain A of RG-II, as (1,3)-α-d-xylosyltransferases (Egelund et al., 2006); QUA1 (GT8), the mutation of which results in a dwarf phenotype, reduced cell adhesion, a 25% reduction in the amounts of GalA in the leaves, and slightly lower levels of Xyl and xylosyltransferase activity (Bouton et al., 2002; Orfila et al., 2005); and Galacturonosyltransferase1 (GAUT1 [GT8]), which is involved in homogalacturonan (HG) synthesis as a (1,4)-α-d-galacturonosyltransferase (Sterling et al., 2006). Other studies have linked at least two other members of the GAUT1-related gene family (IRX8/GAUT12 and PARVUS/AtGATL1) to the synthesis of a specific subfraction of pectin (Persson et al., 2007) and/or to the synthesis of the GalA-containing tetrasaccharide sequence located at the reducing end of dicot and gymnosperm xylans (Brown et al., 2007, 2009; Peña et al., 2007; Persson et al., 2007).Among these previously identified genes, however, GAUT1 is the only galacturonosyltransferase that has been functionally determined to be involved in pectin synthesis (Mohnen, 2008). Bioinformatic analysis of the Arabidopsis genome identified 24 other genes with high sequence similarity to GAUT1 (Sterling et al., 2006). Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the Arabidopsis GAUT1-related gene family separates them into the GAUT and Galacturonosyltransferase-Like (GATL) families. There are 15 GAUT genes in Arabidopsis that encode proteins predicted to be 61 to 78 kD, whereas the 10 Arabidopsis GATL genes encode proteins that have molecular masses between 39 and 44 kD (Sterling et al., 2006).The absence of functional characterization of most members of the GAUT1-related gene family leaves open the question of the roles of these genes and their encoded proteins in cell wall synthesis. A recent analysis (Caffall et al., 2009) of cell walls isolated from homozygous mutants of 12 members of the GAUT family demonstrated that mutations in eight of these genes resulted in discernible changes in cell wall monosaccharide composition. Mutations in AtGAUT6 result in a reduction in GalA that coincides with higher levels of Xyl and Rha in the wall, and preliminary results suggested a role for AtGAUT6 in HG synthesis. Mutations in AtGAUT9, -10, -11, and -12 resulted in significant reductions in GalA content without decreases in Xyl content. Mutations in AtGAUT13 and AtGAUT14 resulted in increased GalA and Gal content coinciding with reduced Xyl and Rha content compared with the wild type. The results of this study reinforce the hypothesis that the proteins encoded by the AtGAUT genes are involved in pectin and/or xylan synthesis, although further work is necessary to validate this hypothesis. We report here on a study of the GATL family in Arabidopsis to lay the foundation for functional characterization of these putative GTs and identification of their role(s) in plant cell wall biosynthesis.A previous study had identified 10 GATL genes within the Arabidopsis GAUT1-related gene family that have high sequence similarity (Sterling et al., 2006). Pairwise comparisons of the amino acid sequences of the whole coding regions of these proteins showed between 56% and 84% identity and between 71% and 89% similarity (Table I). The initial analysis of the GATL phylogeny in Arabidopsis did not yield a statistically robust subclade structure for this GT8 subfamily (Sterling et al., 2006). Subsequent inclusion of additional GATL protein sequences from eight additional fully sequenced plant genomes resolved the GATL subfamily into six subclades with robust statistical support (Yin et al., 2010). This substructure of the GATL tree remains largely unchanged by the addition of sequences from three additional sequenced plant genomes (maize [Zea mays], Medicago truncatula, and papaya [Carica papaya]). In this analysis, an additional clade (GATL-c) that contains only monocot genes was resolved with high statistical support (Fig. 1A). The phylogram shows a basal clade (GATL-g) of GATLs from Physcomitrella patens and Selaginella moellendorfii and six clades of angiosperm GATLs. The functional significance of the GATL subclades remains to be determined. All but one of the angiosperm GATL subclades have both monocot and dicot representatives, suggesting that the divergence of the GATL family occurred before the evolutionary split between monocots and dicots.Pairwise BLAST alignments were done to obtain the identities/similarities, as percentages, over the alignment lengths.Phylogenetic analysis, chromosomal location, and gene structures of AtGATLs. A, Phylogenetic tree of 95 GATL proteins from 12 plant species whose genomes have been sequenced (Supplemental Table S1). The phylogenetic reconstruction was carried out using PhyML as described in “Materials and Methods.” The six genes in GATL-g were selected as the outgroup to root the phylogeny. Selected supporting values for nodes greater than 70% are shown. The phylogeny is displayed using the Interactive Tree of Life Web server (Letunic and Bork, 2007). B, Chromosomal positions and duplication events for AtGATL genes in the Arabidopsis genome (http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/athal/dup). Black and purple boxes depict recent and ancient duplicated segments in chromosomes (chr) I, III, and IV. Solid blue lines between boxes link the recently duplicated regions. Dashed red lines link genes from ancient duplications and are of lower statistical significance than the others. C, Gene structure analysis of AtGATL genes using the Gene Structure Display Server (http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/). UTR, Untranslated region.As several of the AtGATL proteins appeared as pairs of paralogs in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1A), we investigated whether traceable genome duplication events contributed to the complexity of the GATL family in Arabidopsis. The chromosomal locations of AtGATL genes in relation to the segmental duplication history of these regions were analyzed (Blanc and Wolfe, 2004). The resulting chromosome map (Fig. 1B) shows that AtGATL genes are only present on chromosomes I, III, and IV. According to the map, AtGATL8/AtGATL9 and AtGATL5/AtGATL6 constitute pairs of paralogous genes evolved from recent segmental duplication events. The AtGATL1/AtGATL2, AtGATL9/AtGATL10, and AtGATL5/AtGATL7 pairs evolved from older segmental duplication events with good statistical significance. The duplication history of AtGATL genes supports the observed close phylogenetic associations between some members of the AtGATL family. For AtGATL3 and AtGATL4, no traceable duplication history could be found, even though their genome positions are close to duplicated blocks.The AtGATL genes are similar not only in terms of their primary sequence and the size of their encoded proteins but also in their intron/exon organization (Fig. 1C). Of the 10 AtGATL genes, only AtGATL5 and AtGATL6, which appear as paralogs, contain one intron at the same position in their 3′ untranslated region. No introns are present in any of the other AtGATLs. The common intron/exon organization shared by these AtGATL genes supports the results from the phylogenetic analysis and the duplication history.To understand the roles of the AtGATL genes in plant development, we conducted semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis to determine the tissue-specific expression patterns for all AtGATL genes in different tissues taken from 7-week-old plants (Fig. 2). Analyzing different parts of the inflorescence stem makes it possible to monitor primary cell wall and secondary cell wall synthesis in a single stem simply by sectioning at different distances from the apical meristem, because secondary cell wall formation increases from the top to the base of the stem (Turner and Somerville, 1997). An ACTIN gene served as a positive control because it is expressed ubiquitously in all organs.Expression profiles of AtGATL genes in different Arabidopsis tissues. Semiquantitative RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from siliques (S), flowers (F), leaves (L), roots (R), upper stems (Us), middle stems (Ms), and lower stems (Ls) was used to assess AtGATL transcript levels in tissues of 7-week-old Arabidopsis plants. The ACTIN2 gene (At3g18780) was used as a control. All AtGATL gene amplification reactions were carried out for 35 PCR cycles, and the ACTIN gene was amplified for 30 cycles.All 10 AtGATL genes are expressed, but at different levels and with different tissue distribution patterns (Fig. 2). The majority of the AtGATL genes are expressed at various levels in all of the different organs analyzed. However, AtGATL4 is expressed only in flowers. AtGATL2 expression is primarily limited to leaves, upper and lower stems, and, at a low level, in roots. AtGATL6 is highly expressed in upper and middle stems but not in lower stems, suggesting that this gene may be involved in primary cell wall synthesis or the initiation of secondary cell wall synthesis.To extend the observations made with the RT-PCR analyses, we generated promoter::GUS reporter lines in a wild-type Columbia background for each of the AtGATL genes by fusing the GUS gene (Jefferson et al., 1986; Jefferson, 1987) to upstream (promoter and 5′ untranslated regions) and downstream (3′ untranslated regions) sequences of each of the AtGATL genes (AtGATL::GUS). Histochemical staining analyses of GUS activity in the transgenic plants revealed expression patterns that were consistent with the outcome of the RT-PCR analyses done at the whole-tissue level, but with higher resolution (Figs. 3 and ​and4).4). For example, expression of the GUS reporter driven by the AtGATL4 promoter was restricted to flowers, in agreement with the RT-PCR analysis, but was confined to pollen grains and elongating pollen tubes. The tissue/organ-specific GUS expression profiles of all AtGATLs are summarized below.Histochemical analysis of the expression patterns of AtGATL promoter::GUS fusions in Arabidopsis roots and seedlings of 2-week-old plants and in the flowers and siliques of 8-week-old plants. Whole seedlings were cleared and stained for GUS activity (blue coloring). The insets in the AtGATL1, -2, -7, -8, and -10 seedling panels show intense staining of trichomes, and the inset in the AtGATL4 single flower panel shows staining in pollen grains and elongating pollen tubes. A summary of the observed AtGATL expression patterns is provided in Supplemental Table S2.Histochemical analysis of expression of AtGATL promoter::GUS fusions in Arabidopsis inflorescence stems and hypocotyls of transgenic plants. Transverse hand-cut sections from lower, middle, and upper parts of 8-week-old inflorescence stems and 8-week-old hypocotyls were cleared and stained for GUS activity (blue coloring). A summary of the observed AtGATL expression patterns is provided in Supplemental Table S3.Expression of the GUS reporter gene constructs in 10-d-old seedlings was detected in the cotyledons, primary leaves, shoot apices, and roots, depending on the AtGATL gene examined, although frequently only in specific cell types within those tissues. As shown in Figure 3, AtGATL1, -3, -7, -8, and -10 are expressed in cotyledons and primary leaves, whereas AtGATL5 and -9 are only detected in primary leaves. A close examination of primary leaves shows that AtGATL1 and -5 are only expressed in the vasculature of primary leaves. Most AtGATLs, except for AtGATL3, -4, -5, and -9, are also expressed in the trichomes, which form complex secondary walls (Marks et al., 2008). Interestingly, AtGATL1, -2, -3, -5, -6, and -8 are also expressed in the shoot meristem, where only primary wall synthesis would be expected. All AtGATL reporters, with the exception of AtGATL4, are expressed in roots, but with distinct expression patterns for each gene. AtGATL2 is expressed in root tips, developing lateral root meristems, and at the base of extended lateral roots. AtGATL1 and AtGATL3 are expressed in root tips and portions of older roots. The restricted expression pattern of these two GATLs might explain why no expression of these genes could be detected in RT-PCR analyses of whole roots. Both AtGATL6 and AtGATL9 are only expressed in root tips. In addition, AtGATL5, -7, -8, and -10 are strongly expressed throughout the root, but only AtGATL8 and AtGATL10 are expressed in root hairs.Quite diverse patterns of expression were observed in developing flowers among the various AtGATL gene family members (Fig. 3). All AtGATL family members, except for AtGATL2, are expressed in a variety of floral organs, which is consistent with the RT-PCR analysis. AtGATL5 expression in flowers can be detected only in filaments, where AtGATL1 and AtGATL10 expression can also be detected. AtGATL1, -4, and -7 are expressed in the anthers. Expression of AtGATL4 was also observed in elongating pollen tubes (Fig. 3, inset). Carpel tissue expresses AtGATL3, -4, -6, and -10 in the stigma and AtGATL3 in the style. AtGATL3, -8, -9, and -10 are expressed in the sepals of the flower, whereas expression of the AtGATL3, -9, and -10 genes is detected in petals.All 10 AtGATL genes except AtGATL2, -4, and -5 are expressed in senescing siliques (Fig. 3). Many AtGATL members, such as AtGATL1, -3, -7, -8, and -10, are expressed in the abscission zone, and AtGATL7, -8, -9, and -10 are expressed in stigmatic tissue. AtGATL7 shows a unique expression pattern, being expressed in the pedicel of the silique. The overall expression patterns in young seedlings and flowers are summarized in Supplemental Table S2.The RT-PCR data documented that all AtGATL gene family members, except for AtGATL4, are highly expressed in inflorescence stems (Fig. 2). To determine in which cells within the stems these genes are expressed, hypocotyls and upper, middle, and lower parts of inflorescence stems were sectioned, stained, and analyzed. Overall, AtGATLs show overlapping, but not identical, expression patterns in stem and hypocotyl. Figure 4 shows that expression of many of the AtGATL genes is restricted primarily to the vascular tissues, although the patterns of expression vary depending on the AtGATL gene. The simplest expression pattern was observed for AtGATL5 and AtGATL10, whose expression could be detected only in xylem and phloem, respectively, in different parts of stems and hypocotyls. AtGATL6 is expressed in the phloem of the upper stem and in the phloem and developing secondary xylem of the hypocotyl (Fig. 4). In contrast, AtGATL8 expression varies a lot in different parts of stems and is expressed in almost all vascular tissues except for fibers and secondary xylem. It is noteworthy that AtGATL1 was specifically expressed in cells undergoing secondary wall thickening, including interfascicular fibers and metaxylem in stems and secondary xylem in hypocotyls. The AtGATL1 expression pattern observed here is consistent with the finding that this gene is specifically associated with secondary wall thickening in fibers and vessels (Brown et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007). Interestingly, AtGATL2 shows an overlapping expression pattern with AtGATL1 in all parts of the stem, except that there is no expression in fibers. In hypocotyls, AtGATL2 can only be detected in the developing secondary xylem. AtGATL3 is specifically expressed in the epidermis, cortex, and phloem of stems and hypocotyls. AtGATL7 is detected in the phloem of lower stems, the cortex of hypocotyls, upper and middle stems, and the epidermis of upper and middle stems. Finally, AtGATL9 is highly expressed in the protoxylem of all parts of the stem and the cortex of upper stems and hypocotyls. The overall expression patterns in young seedlings are summarized in Supplemental Table S3.The topology of AtGATL proteins was analyzed using the plant membrane protein database, Aramemnon (http://aramemnon.botanik.uni-koeln.de/index.ep). The overall results of these analyses are shown in Supplemental Table S4. All AtGATLs were predicted to be soluble proteins by this analysis. However, the Aramemnon database strongly predicts that all GATL proteins are targeted to the secretory pathway, with at least half of the 18 programs used in Aramemnon predicting an N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide domain for all of the GATL proteins.To establish the subcellular localization of the AtGATL proteins experimentally, we chose four AtGATL isoforms, AtGATL2, AtGATL3, AtGATL7, and AtGATL9, belonging to four different GATL subclades (GATL-d, GATL-e, GATL-b, and GATL-a; Fig. 1A), and generated fluorescently tagged fusion proteins by fusing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) to the C terminus of the full-length AtGATL proteins. The recombinant constructs were transiently coexpressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf epidermal cells with Gmct-ECFP (for enhanced cyan fluorescent protein, a Golgi marker; Saint-Jore-Dupas et al., 2006; Nelson et al., 2007) or ECFP-WAK2-HDEL (endoplasmic reticulum marker; Nelson et al., 2007) constructs, respectively. Confocal microscopy was used to determine the subcellular localization of the recombinant AtGATLs. EYFP-tagged AtGATL3 showed a punctate localization pattern when expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells (Fig. 5C). Colocalization experiments revealed that the localization pattern of AtGATL3-EYFP is identical to that of Gmct-ECFP (Fig. 5, B and D), which was previously shown to be localized in the Golgi (Saint-Jore-Dupas et al., 2006; Nelson et al., 2007). Together, these results demonstrate that AtGATL3 is a Golgi-localized protein. Similar subcellular localizations were also observed for AtGATL2, AtGATL7, and AtGATL9 proteins (data not shown). The Golgi localization of the AtGATL proteins is consistent with their possible role(s) in the biosynthesis of noncellulosic polysaccharides, which occurs in the Golgi (Nebenführ and Staehelin, 2001).Subcellular localization of EYFP-tagged AtGATL proteins. EYFP-tagged AtGATL proteins were transiently expressed in leaf epidermal cells of N. benthamiana plants, and their subcellular locations were examined with a laser scanning confocal microscope.

Homozygous lines with an insertion in the exon or within the 5′ or 3′ noncoding regions were obtained for AtGATL3, -5, -6, -8, and -9 (Fig. 6A). RT-PCR of total RNAs isolated from homozygous atgatl mutant lines allowed us to identify four knockout mutants (atgatl5, atgatl6, atgatl8, and atgatl9) and one knockdown mutant (atgatl3; Fig. 6B). No discernible phenotypic changes were observed in the growth or morphology of any of the mutant plants compared with the wild type under normal growth conditions.Insertional mutants in AtGATL genes. A, Schematic diagrams of the locations of T-DNA inserts in the coding regions (large white rectangles) or untranslated regions (small black rectangles) of the AtGATL3, AtGATL5, AtGATL6, AtGATL8, and AtGATL9 genes. B, AtGATL transcription levels in homozygous mutants of atgatl3, atgatl5, atgatl6, atgatl8, and atgatl9. RT-PCR of total RNAs isolated from stems of 7-week-old homozygous atgatl mutant lines was performed using gene-specific primers (Supplemental Table S6). The ACTIN2 gene (At3g18780) was used as a control. All AtGATL gene amplification reactions were carried out for 35 PCR cycles, and the ACTIN gene was amplified for 30 cycles. WT, Wild type.The amino acid sequences of the AtGATLs contain domains characteristic of GTs (Sterling et al., 2006; Yin et al., 2010), suggesting that these proteins may be involved in cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis. To determine whether disruptions of the five AtGATL genes caused alterations in the monosaccharide composition of total cell wall material, the relative amounts of neutral monosaccharides and GalA were determined for wide-type and five atgatl mutant plants. Stems from 10-week-old plants were chosen for this analysis because this tissue can be harvested in large quantities and all four of the disrupted AtGATL genes are highly expressed in stems, based both on RT-PCR (Fig. 2) and promoter::GUS results (Fig. 4). Compared with wide-type plants, atgatl3, atgatl6, and atgatl9 mutants showed 23.7%, 16.4%, and 20.5% reduction in GalA content, respectively, which was counterbalanced by increases in Xyl in atgatl3 and atgatl6 (Table II). The decrease in GalA content of atgatl3, atgatl6, and atgatl9 supports the argument that, like GAUT1 and QUA1, two other members of the GT8 family, the three AtGATL genes function as putative galacturonosyl transferases involved in pectin synthesis. For atgatl5 and atgatl8, no significant changes in sugar content were observed relative to wild-type plants.The glycosyl residue compositions are for cell walls isolated from inflorescence stems of 10-week-old Arabidopsis plants as determined by GC-MS of trimethyl silyl derivatives as described in “Materials and Methods.” Data are mol % ± se of three independent analyses. Glycosyl residues are abbreviated as Ara, Rha, Fuc, Xyl, Man, Gal, Glc, and GalUA (GalA).To obtain a more complete picture of possible changes in cell wall composition and structure resulting from mutations in the five GATL genes, we analyzed stem cell walls from the mutants using glycome profiling. This method (S. Pattathil and M.G. Hahn, unpublished data) involves ELISA-based screening of sequential extracts prepared from the plant cell walls using a toolkit of approximately 150 plant cell wall glycan-directed monoclonal antibodies that recognize diverse epitopes present on most major classes of plant cell wall polysaccharides, including xyloglucans, xylans, pectins, and arabinogalactans (Pattathil et al., 2010). Glycome profiling gives information about changes both in the nature of the epitopes present in the cell walls and in the extractability of those epitopes from the walls (Zhu et al., 2010), the latter providing some information about larger scale changes in wall structure. Glycome profiles of the five atgatl mutant walls show subtle differences, primarily in epitope extractability patterns, when compared with the glycome profile of wild-type cell walls (Fig. 7). For example, the oxalate extracts of atgatl5 and atgatl6 stems contain easily detectable levels of xyloglucan epitopes, whereas the oxalate extract of wild-type walls show no detectable xyloglucan. There are also subtle differences in the levels of arabinogalactan epitopes in the 1 m KOH extracts of atgatl3, atgatl5, and atgatl9 stem walls compared with the equivalent extract of wild-type stem walls. Lastly, subtle differences in the extractability patterns of xylan epitopes are observable in the glycome profiles of all five atgatl mutant stem walls compared with the profile of wild-type stem walls.Glycome profiling of sequential stem wall extracts prepared from five atgatl mutants and wild-type (WT) plants. Sequential stem cell wall extracts of 10-week-old atgatl and wild-type plants were generated as described in “Materials and Methods.” The presence of cell wall glycan epitopes in each extract was determined by ELISAs using 150 glycan-directed monoclonal antibodies (Pattathil et al., 2010), and the data are presented as heat maps. Reagents used for extracting stem materials are indicated on the top of each column. The panel on the right lists the array of antibodies used (left-hand side) grouped according to the principal cell wall glycan (right-hand side) recognized by the antibodies. The colored outlines highlight changes in glycome profiles in the mutant walls compared with the wild type: green outlines, xyloglucan epitopes; blue outlines, pectin and arabinogalactan epitopes; red outlines, xylan epitopes. The yellow-black scale indicates the strength of the ELISA signal: bright yellow color depicts strongest binding, and black color indicates no binding. Col., Ecotype Columbia.The GAUT1-related gene family in Arabidopsis consists of 25 genes, all of which encode proteins belonging to CAZy GT8 family. Phylogenetically, this gene family splits into two clades of related genes, the GAUT clade of 15 genes, one of which, AtGAUT1, has been shown to encode a functional HG galacturonosyltransferase (Sterling et al., 2006), and the GATL clade of 10 genes. The proteins encoded by both clades contain several conserved amino acid sequences that are unique to these clades within the larger GT8 family (Yin et al., 2010). However, AtGATLs and AtGAUTs also differ from one another in a couple of ways. These differing characteristics raise questions about the possible role(s) of AtGATL proteins in cell wall glycan synthesis.AtGATL proteins are smaller and lack an obvious transmembrane domain such as that present in the AtGAUTs. Nonetheless, AtGATL proteins do appear to contain a hydrophobic signal peptide at their N termini, which would be expected to target AtGATL proteins to the endomembrane system. Previous studies had shown that AtGATL1 is retained within the endomembrane system, specifically in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments (Kong et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2009). We demonstrate here that four other AtGATL proteins, belonging to four different subclades within the GATL subfamily, colocalize with a Golgi marker (Fig. 5). Thus, the localization of these AtGATL proteins places them in a position within the cell to participate in plant cell wall matrix polysaccharide synthesis, which is thought to take place in the Golgi (Scheible and Pauly, 2004; Sandhu et al., 2009). However, AtGATL proteins contain no transmembrane domain, nor do they contain any other known signal sequences that would retain them within the Golgi. Thus, these AtGATL proteins must be retained within the Golgi by another mechanism. There is precedence for transmembrane domain-independent Golgi localization. For example, reversibly glycosylated polypeptide showed cytoplasmic and transient association with the Golgi, yet it does not possess any signal sequence (Sagi et al., 2005; Drakakaki et al., 2006). We hypothesize that the AtGATL proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and retained in the Golgi by virtue of their interaction with proteins that are membrane embedded or anchored and that carry Golgi retention signals. This hypothesis awaits further experimental investigation, particularly with respect to possible protein-protein interactions involving AtGAUT proteins, which have transmembrane domains and are localized to the Golgi (Sterling et al., 2001).The AtGATL proteins show a significantly higher sequence identity/similarity (Table I) than do the AtGAUTs (Sterling et al., 2006; Caffall et al., 2009). For example, AtGATL5 and AtGATL6 share 77% identity to each other, and AtGATL8 and AtGATL9 are 84% identical in their coding regions. Such high sequence identity might be indicative of functional redundancy among these sets of AtGATL family members. The phylogenetic analysis of the GATL protein family also suggests such functional redundancy, particularly among the AtGATL5/AtGATL6 and AtGATL8/AtGATL9 pairs, which appear to have arisen by relatively recent partial genome duplication events in Arabidopsis.However, the gene expression data presented here, as examined using transgenic pGATL::GUS expression, argues against the functional redundancy of these proteins. The constructs used for these studies included the 3′ untranslated regions of the GATL genes to better ensure that any GUS expression observed accurately reflects AtGATL gene expression, in light of previous reports that DNA elements in the 3′ regions of plant genes can regulate gene expression (Dean et al., 1989; Dietrich et al., 1992; Larkin et al., 1993; Fu et al., 1995a, 1995b; Chen et al., 1998). As indicated by GUS expression, each of the AtGATL genes shows a unique expression pattern, although there is some overlap, particularly in the vasculature. For example, AtGATL5 is expressed in secondary xylem of stems and in filaments of flowers, while AtGATL6 is expressed in phloem of upper stems and in stigma and style of the flower. Different expression patterns were also observed for the AtGATL8 and AtGATL9 genes. Furthermore, recent research on two poplar (Populus deltoides) isoforms of AtGATL1 also suggests functional specialization of GATL proteins (Kong et al., 2009). The differing tissue-specific expression patterns between such duplicated genes suggests that subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization has happened, a process that occurs mainly through mutations in regulatory sequences instead of via mutations in the coding sequence (Blanc and Wolfe, 2004; Haberer et al., 2004; Langham et al., 2004).The GATL proteins also share high sequence identity/similarity among species. For example, PdGATL1.1 and PdGATL1.2 share about 80% identity at the amino acid level with AtGATL1. Transformation of either poplar GATL1 ortholog into the Arabidopsis atgatl1 mutant background complemented several phenotypes of the atgatl1 mutant, including decreased Xyl content, tissue morphology, and growth habit (Kong et al., 2009). Thus, the functions of GATL genes may be largely conserved between different species.In order to gain insight into the biochemical functions of AtGATL family members, we analyzed the cell walls isolated from stems of T-DNA insertion mutants of AtGATL3, -5, -6, -8, and -9 using both glycosyl composition analysis and glycome profiling. Both analyses revealed only subtle changes in wall composition and structure and thus did not yield definitive information about the functions of these five AtGATL genes in cell wall biogenesis. For example, the glycosyl composition analyses showed significant decreases in the GalA content of stem walls in atgatl3, atgatl6, and atgatl9 but also showed changes in other glycosyl residues (Table II). Glycome profiling of the stem cell walls did not reveal the absence of any particular polysaccharide component recognized by the diverse suite of plant glycan-directed monoclonal antibodies used in any of the five atgatl mutants analyzed (Fig. 7) and therefore also did not provide direct evidence of AtGATL function in these plants. Nonetheless, glycome profiling did demonstrate changes in overall wall structure in each of the five mutants, as evidenced by altered patterns of epitope extractability. For example, some xyloglucan epitopes were more easily extracted from the walls of atgatl5 and atgatl6 stems compared with wild-type walls. Changes in the extractability patterns of pectic arabinogalactan epitopes were also observed. Our results suggest that cell wall analyses carried out at whole-plant or whole-tissue level resolution are unlikely to document dramatic changes in cell wall composition and structure in mutants when expression of the affected gene is highly localized to specific cell types in wild-type plants, as is the case for most of the GATL genes in Arabidopsis (Figs. 3 and ​and4).4). Thus, it will likely be more informative to examine specific cell types that express a GATL gene of interest for changes in wall structure in order to infer the function of that GATL protein in cell wall synthesis. For example, we have found that atgatl5 shows defects in seed coat mucilage production, suggesting that AtGATL5 plays a role in synthesizing the pectic polysaccharides that are the principal components of this mucilage (Y. Kong and M.G. Hahn, unpublished data). This phenotype would not be observed in analyses carried out at the whole-plant or whole-tissue level.Several pieces of data, in addition to the decreased GalA content mentioned above, implicate AtGATL3, AtGATL6, and AtGATL9 in pectic polysaccharide synthesis, which occurs in primary wall synthesis. The AtGATL3 promoter::GUS expression results, which show that AtGATL3 expression in stem is mainly localized in primary cell wall-rich cells, such as epidermis and cortex, support the hypothesis that AtGATL3 is a primary cell wall-associated gene. The RT-PCR data showed that AtGATL6 expression is lower at the base of the stem compared with the top, indicating that AtGATL6 is preferentially expressed in younger stems, where primary cell wall synthesis predominates. Given the fact that AtGATL6 promoter::GUS is expressed only in the phloem of upper stems, we suggest that AtGATL6 may be involved in primary cell wall synthesis in developing phloem. Transcriptional profiling of genes differentially expressed during in vitro xylem differentiation in Arabidopsis suspension cells showed that AtGATL6 and AtGATL9 expression levels decreased rapidly before xylem vessel element formation (Kubo et al., 2005), further supporting a role for these two genes in primary cell wall synthesis. However, the hypothesis that AtGATL3, -6, and -9 are involved in pectin synthesis will require further experimental substantiation.It is noteworthy that all AtGATL genes except AtGATL4 are expressed in vascular tissue, with several family members showing overlapping expression patterns in different vascular cell types. This is true for the phloem (AtGATL3, -6, -7, -8, and -10), protoxylem (AtGATL8 and -9), metaxylem (AtGATL1, -2, and -5), secondary xylem (AtGATL1, -2, -5, -6, and -8), and cortex (AtGATL3, -7, -8, and -9). Such overlapping expression patterns for many family members during vascular development suggest a potential for combinational AtGATL action in vascular cell wall synthesis or, alternatively, that some functional redundancy may occur among GATL proteins, at least in some tissues. The latter could explain the absence of dramatic phenotypes in the five mutant lines that were examined in this study.The involvement of AtGATL1 in xylan synthesis during secondary wall formation has been reported previously (Brown et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007), and a close correlation between AtGATL1 expression and the expression of AtCESA (for cellulose synthase) genes associated with secondary cell wall formation has also been reported (Mutwil et al., 2009). Although AtGATL1 has been linked to xylan synthesis, it is not clear whether this GATL is directly involved in xylan biosynthesis, possibly in connection with the synthesis of the GalA-containing reducing end oligosaccharide (Peña et al., 2007) or indirectly through the synthesis of another polysaccharide that establishes a foundation for xylan synthesis (Mohnen, 2008). In this context, the very strong AtGATL1 expression observed in the root apical meristem and elongation zones is interesting (Fig. 3), tissues where xylan synthesis is not known to occur in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, four AtGATLs, AtGATL3, -6, -7, and -8, have been shown to be coexpressed with AtCESA genes that are involved in primary cell wall synthesis (Mutwil et al., 2009). These data suggest that the majority of AtGATL genes expressed in vascular tissues are involved in primary cell wall synthesis in these tissues. It is also notable that five of the AtGATL members are expressed in the abscission zone of silique and six are expressed in trichomes. Both trichomes and abscission zones are rich in pectins (Henderson et al., 2001; Marks et al., 2008), polysaccharides characteristic of primary cell walls, further suggesting that these AtGATL genes are involved in pectin synthesis in these tissues.AtGATL4 stands out among the AtGATL family because it is expressed exclusively in the flower. The GUS reporter-based expression analyses localized AtGATL4 expression specifically to the pollen grain and elongating pollen tube. Pectic polysaccharides are a major component of pollen grains and pollen tube walls, where they help maintain the cylindrical shape of the pollen tube and act as adhesion molecules during the fertilization process (Lord and Russell, 2002; Bosch et al., 2005). AtGATL1 and -7 are also expressed in pollen, although not specifically, implicating a potentially specialized function of some AtGATL family members in the deposition of pollen cell wall pectin components.In summary, the unique and overlapping cell type-specific expression of each AtGATL family member provides useful information and a platform for understanding their functions. The Golgi localization of the AtGATLs, their expression patterns, the available microarray data and coexpression analyses, as well as the cell wall compositional analyses strongly implicate at least some of the AtGATL family members, like AtGATL3, -6, and -9, in the biosynthesis of primary cell walls in diverse organs and tissues of Arabidopsis by contributing to pectin synthesis. However, given the partial overlapping gene expression patterns for several GATLs in some Arabidopsis tissues, more extensive gene knockout analyses, either simultaneously using RNA interference or by piling up multiple insertional mutations, and biochemical studies in specific cell and tissue types will be required to address the biological functions of the AtGATL genes.The 12 draft plant genomes, predicted genes, and translated protein data used for bioinformatic analysis of the GATL family were downloaded from various sources, as specified in Supplemental Table S1. GATL proteins were identified from these genomes using an HMMER search (Eddy, 1998) for the Pfam (Finn et al., 2006) Glyco_transf_8 (PF01501; 345 amino acids long) domain as the query. This HMMER search, using an E-value cutoff of 1e-2 or less, identified 99 GATL proteins from the 12 genomes. Four protein sequences were removed due to the fact that they were truncated or lacked key amino acid motifs characteristic of GT8 (Yin et al., 2010). A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML version 2.4.4 (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003) for the 95 full-length proteins based on their multiple sequence alignment generated using MAFFT version 6.603 (Katoh et al., 2005) using the L-INS-I option as recommended to give the most accurate alignment. Specifically, PhyML analyses were conducted with the JTT model, 100 replicates of bootstrap analyses, estimated proportion of invariable sites, four rate categories, estimated γ-distribution parameter, and an optimized starting BIONJ tree. A clade of six genes (five from Physcomitrella patens and one from Selaginella moellendorfii) that are basal to all other plant GATL proteins examined was selected as the outgroup to root the phylogeny. A rectangular phylogram of the GATL protein sequences was generated using the Interactive Tree of Life Web server (Letunic and Bork, 2007).Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants were grown on soil in a controlled-environment chamber under a 14-h-light/10-h-dark cycle at 19°C during the light period and 15°C during the dark period. The light intensity was 150 μE m−2 s−1, and the relative humidity was maintained at 60% to 70%. Arabidopsis plants of the Columbia ecotype were used for transformation and isolation of DNA and RNA. T-DNA-mutagenized seeds were obtained from the Salk Institute (http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress) through the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Supplemental Table S5). T-DNA insertion mutants for gatl3, -5, -6, -8, and -9 were identified using the flanking primers (LP and RP) generated by the SIGnal T-DNA verification primer design Web site (http://signal.salk.edu/tdnaprimers.html) and primers from the T-DNA left border, LBa1 (5′-GCGTGGACCGCTTGCTGCAACT-3′) and LBb1 (5′-TCAAACAGGATTTTCGCCTGCT-3′). The sequences of the flanking primers for AtGATL genes are provided in Supplemental Table S6.For semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of AtGATL gene expression, siliques, flowers, leaves, upper stems, middle stems, and lower stems were harvested from 7-week-old Arabidopsis plants and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. Roots for RT-PCR were obtained from plants grown hydroponically for 14 d under sterile conditions in B5 vitamin, with 1% (w/v) Suc, pH 5.8, at 22°C in constant white light. Approximately 100 mg of tissue samples was ground in liquid nitrogen, and total RNAs were extracted with the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) and treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μL RT first-strand synthesis reaction that contained oligo(dT) primers. RT-PCR products were generated using primer sequences unique to each of the 10 AtGATL genes (Supplemental Table S7). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed using the following program: 95°C for 3 min; 30 to 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C; then hold at 72°C for 5 min. To determine whether comparable amounts of RNA had been used for RT-PCR from the different tissues, the ACTIN2 gene (At3g18780) was used as a control.To determine AtGATL transcript levels in their respective homozygous mutant lines, total RNAs were isolated from stems of 7-week-old wild-type and homozygous atgatl mutant lines, and the gene transcript levels were analyzed according to the method described above. Knockouts were defined as mutants with RT-PCR reactions that yielded no detectable PCR product using gene-specific primers. Knockdown mutants were those that yielded significantly less, but detectable, PCR product compared with the wild-type plants.The cell-specific expression pattern of the AtGATL genes was studied using the GUS reporter gene. For each AtGATL promoter::GUS reporter gene construct, approximately 2.5 kb upstream of the predicted ATG start codons (including 5′ untranslated regions) and 1 to 1.5 kb downstream of the predicted stop codons (including 3′ untranslated regions) were PCR amplified using Pfx50 Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) with gene-specific primers containing appropriate restriction sites. Then, the two amplified genomic DNA fragments were fused with the GUS gene in the binary vector pBI101 to create the AtGATL promoter::GUS reporter gene construct. Sequences of the individual primers used are listed in Supplemental Table S8. Each of the AtGATL promoter::GUS reporter gene constructs was sequenced to verify its construction. The gene fusions were first electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 and then introduced into Arabidopsis wild-type plants (Columbia ecotype) via the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Transgenic plants were selected on plates containing kanamycin (50 mg L−1).Expression of AtGATL::GUS transgenes was visualized by staining for GUS activity as described (Jefferson et al., 1987). Briefly, transgenic plants or excised tissues were stained in GUS staining solution (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm ferricyanide, 1 mm ferrocyanide, 0.1% [v/v] Triton X-100, and 1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-GlcA) at 37°C. The staining buffer was removed, and the samples were cleared in 70% (v/v) ethanol until the blue color became visible. For each construct, plants from five to 10 independent transgenic lines were examined. Patterns of gene expression for each construct were consistent across multiple transgenic lines, and representative plants were photographed with a stereoscopic microscope (Olympus SZH-ILLD) equipped with a Nikon DS-Ril camera head using NIS-Elements Basic Research software.The coding regions for selected AtGATL genes were cloned in frame with an EYFP gene under the control of the 35S promoter in a pCAMBIA-based binary vector (Kong et al., 2009) to generate the fusion constructs (35S-AtGATL-EYFP). Primers used for creating the EYFP fusions are listed in Supplemental Table S9. The AtGATL constructs were sequenced to verify their construction and then transformed individually into A. tumefaciens strain GV3101. The constructs were individually cotransformed into fully expanded leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana plants together with the ECFP-tagged Golgi marker Gmct-ECFP (Saint-Jore-Dupas et al., 2006; Nelson et al., 2007). Cotransformation and signal observation were done as described previously (Kong et al., 2009).Cell walls were prepared as alcohol-insoluble residues (AIR) as described previously (Persson et al., 2007). In brief, stems from 10-week-old Arabidopsis wild-type and mutant plants were harvested on ice, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. The ground materials were consecutively extracted with 2 volumes of 100 mL of ice-cold 80% (v/v) ethanol, 100% ethanol, chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v), and 100% acetone. Starch was removed from the walls by treatment with type I porcine α-amylase (Sigma-Aldrich; 47 units per 100-mg cell wall) in 100 mm ammonium formate (pH 6.0) for 48 h at room temperature with constant rotation. Destarched walls were centrifuged, washed three times with sterile water and twice with 100% acetone, and air dried. Sugar composition analyses were carried out on three independently prepared cell wall preparations using trimethyl silyl ethers of methyl glycosides as described (Caffall et al., 2009).Sequential extraction of cell walls (AIR) isolated from wild-type and atgatl mutant plants was done on 10 mg mL−1 suspensions. First, the AIR samples were suspended in 50 mm ammonium oxalate (pH 5.0). The suspension was incubated overnight at room temperature with constant mixing. After the incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 3,400g, the supernatant was decanted and saved, and the pellet was washed three times with deionized water before subsequent extraction steps. The washed pellet was then sequentially extracted in the same manner using 50 mm sodium carbonate (pH 10), 1 m KOH, and 4 m KOH. In each step, the supernatants were individually decanted and saved. The 1 m and 4 m KOH extracts were neutralized with glacial acetic acid. All cell wall extracts were dialyzed against four changes of 20 L of deionized water (sample:water, approximately 1:60) at room temperature for a total of 48 h and then lyophilized.Cell wall extracts were dissolved in deionized water (0.2 mg mL−1), and total sugar contents of cell wall extracts were estimated using the phenol-sulfuric acid method (Masuko et al., 2005). Cell wall extracts (60 μg sugar mL−1) were applied to the wells of ELISA plates (Costar 3598) at 50 μL per well and allowed to evaporate to dryness overnight at 37°C. A Biotek robotic system was used to perform fully automated ELISA using a series of 150 monoclonal antibodies directed against plant cell wall carbohydrate epitopes (Pattathil et al., 2010). ELISA data are presented as a heat map in which the antibody order is based on a hierarchical clustering analysis of the antibody collection that groups the antibodies according to their binding patterns to a panel of diverse plant glycans (Pattathil et al., 2010).Monoclonal antibodies were obtained as hybridoma cell culture supernatants either from laboratory stocks at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (JIM and MAC series; available from CarboSource Services [http://www.carbosource.net]) or from Plant Probes (LM series, PAM1 [http://www.plantprobes.net]).The following materials are available in the online version of this article.Supplemental Table S1.

PMC3091735,Gene duplications in prokaryotes can be associated with environmental adaptation,False,"Gene duplication is a normal evolutionary process. If there is no selective advantage in keeping the duplicated gene, it is usually reduced to a pseudogene and disappears from the genome. However, some paralogs are retained. These gene products are likely to be beneficial to the organism, e.g. in adaptation to new environmental conditions. The aim of our analysis is to investigate the properties of paralog-forming genes in prokaryotes, and to analyse the role of these retained paralogs by relating gene properties to life style of the corresponding prokaryotes.Paralogs were identified in a number of prokaryotes, and these paralogs were compared to singletons of persistent orthologs based on functional classification. This showed that the paralogs were associated with for example energy production, cell motility, ion transport, and defence mechanisms. A statistical overrepresentation analysis of gene and protein annotations was based on paralogs of the 200 prokaryotes with the highest fraction of paralog-forming genes. Biclustering of overrepresented gene ontology terms versus species was used to identify clusters of properties associated with clusters of species. The clusters were classified using similarity scores on properties and species to identify interesting clusters, and a subset of clusters were analysed by comparison to literature data. This analysis showed that paralogs often are associated with properties that are important for survival and proliferation of the specific organisms. This includes processes like ion transport, locomotion, chemotaxis and photosynthesis. However, the analysis also showed that the gene ontology terms sometimes were too general, imprecise or even misleading for automatic analysis.Properties described by gene ontology terms identified in the overrepresentation analysis are often consistent with individual prokaryote lifestyles and are likely to give a competitive advantage to the organism. Paralogs and singletons dominate different categories of functional classification, where paralogs in particular seem to be associated with processes involving interaction with the environment.Orthologs and paralogs are two key concepts of evolutionary genomics. While orthologs are related via vertical descendent from a common ancestor, paralogs are related via duplication events subsequent to speciation [1]. For practical purposes paralogs are often defined as protein-coding sequences that have at least 30% sequence identity over more than 60% of their lengths [2,3]. In Escherichia coli K-12 as many as 30% of the proteins have at least one paralogous sequence in the genome [3]. The number of paralogs correlates well with genome size; a larger genome will in general have more paralogous genes [4].According to Ohno [5], the first to both gather evidence for gene duplication and to describe the various fates of the duplicated genes, there are three possible outcomes of a duplication event where the gene duplicate is kept: neofunctionalization (the evolution of a new function in one of the duplicates), subfunctionalization (the division of ancestral functions among duplicates), and conservation of function (the conservation of all functions in both duplicates) [6]. If there is no selective advantage in keeping the duplicated gene, then the gene may become inactivated by mutations (nonfunctionalization), reduced to a pseudogene and finally removed from the genome by deletion. Actually only a small fraction of duplicated genes evolve new functions and are retained by the organism [7].Expansion of genetic material represents an increased cost for most organisms. What is the evolutionary driving force behind retention of duplicated genes? New gene functions created by gene duplication may be a way of adapting to altered environments. The ability to adapt is crucial to the survival of the organism, and the duplicated genes may facilitate the handling of changed environmental conditions (e.g. nutritional scarcity or thermal stress) [8]. For the duplicated gene to avoid deletion, the gene must represent a positive response to environmental stress, e.g. by quickly picking up a mutation that makes the gene advantageous and selected for as a response to the new conditions, or by just increasing gene dosage as a response to higher demand [4]. When the selective pressure is removed, the paralogs may be lost again [8].An alternative hypothesis of environmental adaptation has been proposed by Sanchez-Perez et al [9]. Instead of creating new gene functions by duplications this hypothesis implies that the gene copy performs the same function as the original gene, but that the paralogs function under different conditions. This kind of paralogs has been named ecoparalogs. An example of this process is seen in the hyperhalophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber. This bacterium has halophilic proteins that have their optimal activity and stability at high salinity. Sanchez-Perez and his colleagues also found paralogous genes that performed the same function but differed in halophilicity; these genes could therefore function as backup genes to maintain essential functions over a wider range of salinity. Examples of ecoparalogs in other prokaryotes were also found, indicating that the presence of ecoparalogs in prokaryotic genomes could be frequent.Prokaryotes can also acquire new genes and gene functions by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT involves transfer of genes between different species, in contrast to the usual vertical inheritance. The gene transfer may happen between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but it is more likely to happen between closely related organisms [10]. The transfer events can be classified into three different categories: acquisition of new genes, acquisition of genes similar to already existing genes (apparent paralogs) and xenologous gene displacement [11]. The latter involves displacement of a gene by a horizontally transferred ortholog from another lineage.Gene duplication, gene loss and horizontal gene transfer are all considered to be important processes that shape prokaryotic genomes [8]. Although prokaryotic genomes are constantly changing because of these processes, the relative size of the genome is rather constant. Thus the two opposing factors of gene gain and gene loss are constantly balanced in prokaryotes. The ratio of genes per amount of DNA is found to be on average 1 kb per gene [12], indicating a relatively stable gene size and genome complexity.In this analysis we have identified annotation terms that are statistically overrepresented in paranomes (set of paralogs) of all fully sequenced prokaryotes at the time of this study, and then performed a biclustering of properties and species based on overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) terms.Statistical overrepresentation analysis is a well established method for finding significantly overrepresented features in a data set, commonly used e.g. for analysing gene sets [13] or transcription factor binding sites [14]. The data set is compared against a background (reference) set representing the average or typical gene set. For each term the number of objects with and without that term in the data set and in the background set is counted, creating a 2 × 2 matrix, and the statistical significance of the distribution is tested using e.g. Fisher's exact test.GO was created as a tool to get a more unified and standard description of genes and their functions in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, in particular since it was found that a large fraction of genes specifying the core biological functions are shared among species. Gene products are described in terms of biological process, cellular components and molecular functions, independent of species [15]. The GO network has a tree structure, where each node (GO term) is the child of a parent, and each child may have more than one parent. Each GO term has a unique GO identifier.Biclustering as it is implemented e.g. in the Biclustering Analysis Toolbox (BicAT) [16] clusters a data set in two dimensions simultaneously. This makes it possible to automatically identify clusters of organisms based on similarity within different subsets (clusters) of features, giving both an overview of features (GO terms) that define individual clusters as well as organisms that are associated with these clusters. Biclustering, or co-clustering, has become a popular way of analysing e.g. gene expression data. The technique may define several alternative solutions of partly overlapping clusters because it is possible for an organism - GO pair to participate in more than one cluster, which could not be achieved by more traditional clustering.Identification of overrepresented features of the paranomes in a large number of prokaryotes has made it possible to analyse selected features to assess the hypothesis that they may reflect how the prokaryotes interact with the environment, e.g. through gene transfer, locomotion, chemotaxis, ion transport or photosynthesis.The general data flow of the analysis is illustrated in Figure ​Figure1,1, starting with the full proteome of each prokaryote. The main analysis consists of mapping of paralogs, identification of statistically overrepresented annotation terms and biclustering of annotation terms versus species in order to identify potentially interesting clusters. See the figure legend for a more detailed description.General data flow in the analysis. For each organism the proteome was extracted and paralogs were identified with Blast searching. The resulting paranomes were analysed by plotting the number of genes with paralogs vs. genome length (Figure 2) and the distribution of COG categories (Figure 3). The paranomes were analysed for statistical overrepresentation of annotation terms using DAVID. The output from DAVID was initially analysed as a graph (Figure 4), using overlap between complete annotation lists from DAVID to define pairwise similarities between species. Clusters in the graph were identified with visual inspection (Table 1). For a more stringent analysis only GO terms were used, and these were analysed with biclustering using a matrix consisting of individual GO term occurrences for each species. First data based on three different background models for DAVID were compared (Figure 5). Clusters for the optimal background model were then analysed for GO terms frequently associated with specific species (Table 2). Interesting clusters in the biclustering were identified by analysing GO similarity versus genomic distance (Figure 6), and selected clusters representing simultaneously both high GO similarity and large evolutionary distance (Table 3) were discussed in relationship to literature data.We identified paralogs in 897 prokaryotes by sequence analysis, using all fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes (archaea and bacteria) from NCBI [17] at the time of analysis. The 200 prokaryotes with the highest paralog fraction were included in the full analysis (Table S1 in Additional File 1), see Methods. Among these organisms were 10 archaea. The paralog fraction was defined as the ratio between the number of proteins with one or more paralogs (not considering the number of copies) and the total number of proteins in that particular proteome, and is also known as the degree of duplication. The organism with highest paralog fraction in our analyses was Aster yellows witches-broom phytoplasma (strain AYWB) (12.12%), the organism with lowest paralog fraction (among the top 200 organisms) was Streptococcus pyogenes (strain MGAS8232) (2.28%).Our paralog criterion was set to 75% identity between sequences. This is a fairly strict cut-off, as a more commonly used criterion is 30% sequence identity over more than 60% of the sequence length. By setting a relatively strict sequence identity cut-off, our analyses will focus on recently arisen or well conserved paralogs. The paralogs are therefore likely to have retained the same or at least a very similar function, so that they represent a real and often recent amplification of this particular function. In this way we are focusing on functions where the prokaryote may have had a recent need to increase the gene dosage, e.g. to adapt to a changing environment or new niche in which it probably is living right now. However, the strict cut-off makes it difficult to compare the paralog fraction in our analysis with other analyses where a less strict criterion has been used.It is possible that some of the genes in our analyses are not ""real"" paralogs, as they may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Horizontally transferred genes from species that are not closely related to the host will in most cases be less similar to the copy in the recipient genome. Our strict paralog cut-off therefore makes it likely that genes from horizontal gene transfer constitute a very small part of the data set, unless they in fact are true paralogs that have been copied into the genome more than once.Earlier analyses [18,19] have shown that there is a linear correlation between the number of paralogs and the genome size of an organism. To confirm this relationship, we plotted the number of genes with paralogs (not considering the number of copies) versus genome size, as shown in Figure ​Figure2.2. The figure shows that there is a relatively good correlation (r = 0.73 when outliers are included, r = 0.80 when outliers are excluded) between genome size and the number of genes with paralogs. However, three genomes (indicated in the figure) have clearly more paralogs compared to the general trend; these are Microcystis aeruginosa, Methylobacterium nodulans, and Acaryochloris marina. The genome of the cyanobacterium M. aeruginosa is known to have high plasticity, and as much as 11.8% of the genome consists of insertion sequences and transposable elements [20]. This may explain the high number of genes with paralogs. The alphaproteobacterium M. nodulans and cyanobacterium A. marina have a total of 7 and 9 plasmids each [21]. Only the size of the main chromosome was used for the figure, thus these two genomes appear smaller than they actually are.Number of genes with paralogs versus genome size. Relationship between numbers of genes having paralogs versus genome size for 200 prokaryotes, including trend line (trend line equation y = 26.99x + 13.40 where y and x stand for ""number of genes with paralogs"" and ""genome size"" respectively, correlation coefficient r = 0.73). In particular three genomes differ from the linear trend; these are M. aeruginosa (MICAN), M. nodulans (METNO), and A. marina (ACAM). When these outliers are excluded, correlation coefficient r = 0.80 (trend line equation y = 23.89x + 20.59).The functional classification of paralog-forming genes was compared to paralog-less genes (singletons) that are conserved in the majority of prokaryotic genomes, so-called persistent singletons. The paralogs were classified according to function by using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) classification in the protein table files from NCBI [22], further details are given in Methods. The singletons data were extracted from a published data set [23]. The paralog and singleton sets were compared to the full set of entries in the COG database [24], see Figure ​Figure33.Distribution of COG categories. The figure shows distribution of paralogs and persistent singletons according to COG categories, as well as the general distribution of the COG database. '-' is used where no COG group could be identified. The different categories are A: RNA processing and modification, B: chromatin structure and dynamics, C: energy production and conversion, D: cell-cycle control and mitosis, E: amino acid metabolism and transport, F: nucleotide metabolism and transport, G: carbohydrate metabolism and transport, H: coenzyme metabolism, I: lipid metabolism, J: translation, K: transcription, L: replication and repair, M: cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, N: cell motility, O: post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperone functions, P: inorganic ion transport and metabolism, Q: secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism, R: general functional prediction only, S: function unknown, T: signal transduction, U: intracellular trafficking and secretion, V: defence mechanisms, W: extracellular structures, Y: nuclear structure, Z: cytoskeleton. COG classification A, Y, and Z are not used for prokaryotic COGs.It is difficult to compare the distribution of paralogs and singletons directly, as the ratios are sensitive e.g. to whether ribosomal proteins are included or not. We therefore focussed mainly on COG classes where either paralogs or singletons are close to zero, thereby reducing the importance of the relative scaling. This showed that paralogs are preferentially associated with energy production and conversion (COG category C), cell motility (N), inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P), signal transduction (T), and defence mechanisms (V). The singletons are preferentially associated with cell-cycle control and mitosis (D), nucleotide metabolism and transport (F), and post-translational modification (O), indicating that these processes are under more strict control, not allowing for duplications. For both groups replication and repair (L) is important, and to some extent transcription (K).The features that describe the set of paralogs are features that may contribute to a competitive advantage for the organism. By having more copies of genes in the category inorganic ion transport and metabolism the organisms may enhance the uptake of trace metals that are important for survival. The accessibility of such essential trace metals (e.g. copper and iron) in some environments may be scarce and difficult to utilize [25], and enhancing the functional capabilities may be of great advantage. The COG category for defence mechanisms is also associated with paralogs. Several bacteria live in environments that are stressful for the organism, e.g. environments with harmful contaminations, lack of nutrition or environments with a high or low temperature. All of these factors may be stressful and cause damage to DNA. Therefore, by having more copies of replication/repair genes, the organism adds extra robustness to its repair system. Extra copies of genes involved in cell motility may also be advantageous, making it possible to move around in more variable environments.A similar analysis has been performed by Pushker et al [19] where they analysed the differences of functional classification between large gene families with more than five members (paralogs) and singletons in E. coli K-12 and Bacillus subtilis. For E. coli they found that genes involved in transport of metabolites were overrepresented, followed by genes for transcription and replication/repair. A high association of paralogs with amino acid metabolism was also confirmed by an analysis performed by Gevers et al [8]; they assigned functional classes to genes of 48 genomes. In addition, they found retained duplicates in COG categories transcription (K) and inorganic ion metabolism (P) and to a lesser extent in carbohydrate metabolism (G), defence mechanisms (V), and energy production and conversion (C). Our analyses confirm most of these results, in particular regarding inorganic ions, defence mechanisms and energy production, but we found a quite low distribution of paralogs involved in transport of metabolites. The differences in functional classification may to some extent be caused by our strict paralog criterion, which may rule out paralogs that have adapted to new functions, e.g. transport of alternative metabolites.Pushker et al also found that singletons were almost equally distributed among the functional categories (excluding genes with an unknown function). This is different from our analysis, where singletons in particular are overrepresented in the translation category (J). This category consists mainly of ribosomal proteins, and those genes are usually found with only one copy in the genome [23]. The singletons discussed here are so-called persistent singletons; i.e. they are found in the majority of the genomes included in the analysis. The singletons in the analysis of Pushker et al are not persistent, and the handling of ribosomal proteins is not described in their analysis. The two analyses are therefore not directly comparable.We used the Database for Annotation and Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [26] and associated tools to identify statistically overrepresented annotation terms for the set of paralogs from each prokaryote. To get an initial overview of the full data set we did a pairwise comparison of all species by matching the lists of overrepresented terms and counting the number of terms that were found in both lists. The final list of pairwise similarities between species was then used as input to Cytoscape [27], using species (i.e. paranomes) as nodes and the number of shared annotation terms as edge weights. An automatic layout approach was used for the resulting graph (Figure ​(Figure4),4), and a selection of potentially interesting clusters was identified by visual inspection of this graph (Table ​(Table11).Graph-representation of similarity between species. The graph shows individual organisms as nodes, and the edges represent strong overlap between annotation lists from DAVID (See Methods for details). Layout was computed by Cytoscape. Clusters were selected by visual inspection, and are numbered according to Table 1.Clusters from the graph visualization of speciesFor each cluster (Clus) in Figure 4 the number of species (N), the dominating species (in percentage of N) and selected dominating annotation term(s) from the overrepresentation analysis (in percentage of N in which this term was found) is shown. Several annotation terms will be highly similar, representing the same type of property, therefore only a selection of terms is shown.The resulting clusters gave an interesting overview of the data set. The graph itself shows some clear clusters, but also a high level of connectivity (edges) between clusters, even though a quite strict criterion has been used. The overlap was required to consist of at least 10 annotation terms, and it should cover at least 30% of the maximum possible overlap (see Figure S1 in Additional File 2 and Methods). This gave a network of 567 nodes and 3796 edges, whereas an overlap of at least 3 annotation terms without any requirement on relative size of the overlap gave a network consisting of 826 nodes and 29755 edges. The latter network illustrates the extensive connectivity in the data set, although it is too complex for identification of clusters. This shows that the data set can (and probably should) be clustered in several different ways.Some clusters in Table ​Table11 are dominated by multiple strains of a single species, e.g. cluster 7 (Escherichia coli), or by closely related species, e.g. clusters 9 (Bacillus sp.), 10 (Staphylococcus sp.), and 13 (Mycobacterium sp.). More interesting are clusters with high diversity with respect to species, but low diversity with respect to function, e.g. clusters 1 (transposition), 5 (photosynthesis), 6 (regulation of transcription), 11 (flagellum), and 12 (locomotion, chemotaxis). Most of these seem to be associated with how the prokaryotes interact with and respond to changes in the environment.This analysis gave a useful overview of the data set. However, the analysis is obviously sensitive to several factors like annotation level, similarity cut-off, and graph layout. It was therefore relevant to use a more well-defined approach for this data set, focusing on the 200 species with largest paralog fraction, using a high-quality subset of annotation terms and flexible clustering.We started by analysing how the choice of background set for overrepresentation analysis would influence the clustering result, using three different background sets. The test set consisting of the paranome for each organism was the same in all cases, whereas the background sets either were all paralogs (i.e. the full paranome), all proteomes, or the individual proteome for each organism. The overrepresentation analysis performed by DAVID resulted in annotation terms within a range of different categories, e.g. InterPro, SMART, PIR SuperFamily, KEGG, COG, and GO. The latter was the best represented category; therefore GO [15] was best suited to describe features of the paranomes. The overrepresented GO terms for the paralogs in our test set were therefore used for analysis.The subsequent data analysis was going to be based on biclustering on GO terms and species. It is a reasonable hypothesis that the best data set for clustering is the one forming the most homogenous clusters with respect to GO, so that the clusters tend to contain closely related GO terms. This favours clusters representing a single dominating feature. We used BicAT [16] with the BiMax algorithm on the test set versus each of the three background sets (full results from BicAT are not shown, but are available upon request). The clustering from BicAT using all paralogs as background resulted in 1534 clusters and included 167 organisms; meaning that 33 of the 200 initial organisms were not included. The majority of these (29) contained none or only one GO term and could therefore not be clustered by BicAT using GO terms only. There were also 9 organisms with only two GO terms. The combination of the two GO terms had to be found in at least one other organism for these organisms to be included in any clusters. This was not the case for four organisms; therefore only 167 genomes could be clustered. We also chose to remove clusters containing only different strains of E. coli (~110 clusters, or 7%), as the high number of closely related strains would cause large and artificially uniform clusters.We then used Gene Semantic Similarity Analysis and Measurement Tools (G-SESAME) [28] to measure the similarity of GO terms within each cluster. This program encodes the biological meaning of GO terms into a numeric value by aggregating the semantic contributions of their ancestor terms [28]. The clusters get a score value between 0 and 1; a higher score implies a more similar or unambiguous cluster. The similarity score for each of the three analyses is shown in Figure ​Figure5.5. From this figure we see that clusters from the overrepresentation analysis using the background set consisting of all paralogs got the highest average similarity score, thus implying the most unambiguous clusters.Within-cluster GO similarities for alternative background models. The distribution of within-cluster similarity scores for GO terms computed over all clusters from DAVID using three different background models: individual proteomes, all paralogs, and all proteomes. A higher score implies a more similar or unambiguous cluster with respect to GO terms, which is what we try to achieve to facilitate the subsequent analysis of clusters. The average for all paralogs is significantly different from the average for individual proteomes and all proteomes (p = 2.01 × 10-47 and p = 1.95 × 10-65 respectively using a two-sided t-test).This result seems reasonable based on the properties of these background sets. Using the full set of proteomes as background will highlight how the paralogs are different from the complete set of proteins. However, this will include a large number of proteins that never are involved in any comparable processes, and because of that almost any combination of paralogs may seem to be somehow unique, compared to the more inflated background set. The same will obviously be true when we use each individual proteome as background. This will still contain a large number of genes involved in other processes. However, if we use the full paranome as background we highlight how the evolutionary process of a given organism is unique compared to evolutionary processes in general. This is a far more relevant question, which highlights unique features of individual organisms. This is also consistent with the more general guideline for overrepresentation analysis, ""to set up the population background as the pool of genes that have a chance to be selected for the studied annotation category in the scope of the users' particular study"" [29].The set of overrepresented GO terms identified using the full paranome as background was therefore chosen for further analyses. The phrase ""overrepresented GO terms"" will be used to denote the GO terms retrieved from the DAVID analysis of this data set. The BicAT clustering output gave several partly overlapping clusters, representing alternative solutions to the biclustering problem. First we identified frequent co-occurrences of species and features (GO terms) in these clusters, as this probably represents features that are strongly associated with individual species. Next we identified clusters showing indications of convergent evolution of species with respect to common features (see below).To get an overview of frequent associations between GO terms and species we counted all GO term - species co-occurrences over all BicAT clusters. The frequency of each association indicates the importance of the GO term in defining a relevant property for that species. The results are presented in Additional file 3 as Table S2. The GO terms are listed according to which organism they are associated with, making it easy to identify important features for a given species. However, many highly similar strains of the same species will give an artificially strong species - GO term association; therefore the 11 strains of E. coli originally included in the data set were removed from this analysis.From the complete table (Table S2 in Additional file 3) we see that the GO terms most frequently associated with a given species in biclustering are rather general. Some combinations appear quite often, in the range of 40-60 times, and typical GO terms are regulation of macromolecule metabolic process (GO:0060255), biological regulation (GO:0065007), macromolecule metabolic process (GO:0043170), DNA metabolic process (GO:0006259), biological regulation (GO:0065007), ribonucleotide binding (GO:0032553), purine nucleoside binding (GO:0001883), intracellular organelle part (GO:0044446), glycosaminoglycan catabolic process (GO:0006027), and polysaccharide metabolic process (GO:0005976). These terms are in most cases too general, making it difficult to identify any specific association between lifestyle and paralogs. To be able to draw any reliable conclusions regarding important features associated with individual species we have chosen to base the discussion on a subset. Table ​Table22 presents a representative subset of Table S2, focusing on GO terms representing specific processes or functions, rather than more general processes.Frequent species - GO terms associationsA subset of five organisms from the analysed data set, showing the frequency of GO terms associated with these organisms over all clusters. Phylogenetic class of each organism is indicated.For Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron the GO terms concerning polysaccharides and membrane are overrepresented. This is in accordance with the genome annotation done by Xu et al [30], as they found genes involved in polysaccharide uptake and degradation to be one of the most markedly expanded paralogous groups. B. thetaiotaomicron belongs to the group of Bacteroides and is found in the human colon [31]. The ability to utilize otherwise indigestible polysaccharides, often referred to as ""dietary fibre"", is probably one of the reasons that Bacteroides are one of the predominant genera in the colon [32]. The genome of B. thetaiotaomicron also encodes many outer membrane proteins that are likely to be involved in acquisition of polysaccharides [30]. Methylibium petroleiphilum belongs to the betaproteobacteria and has the capability to metabolize the fuel oxygenate methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) [33], a persistent groundwater contaminant [34]. It also degrades aromatic and straight-chain hydrocarbons found in petroleum products [33]. Overrepresented GO terms are cobalamin metabolic process, tetrapyrrole metabolic process, and cofactor metabolic process. A study by Rohwerder et al [35] investigated the degradation pathway of 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid (2-HIBA), an intermediate in the degradation pathway of MTBE. The study was performed with the MTBE-degrading betaproteobacteria-strain L108. The results showed a cobalt and cobalamin dependence for degradation of MTBE. When growing in a cobalt-deficient medium, degradation rate and growth rate were significantly reduced [35]. Oxidoreductase activity is one of the overrepresented GO terms for Nitrobacter hamburgensis. The bacterium gains energy by oxidation of nitrite to nitrate [36], thus the retained duplicates are likely to enhance the energy conservation for this organism. Nostoc punctiforme is a member of the genus Cyanobacteria, and GO terms for photosynthesis and vesicles are overrepresented. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that carry out photosynthesis [37], this result is also supported by hits in the KEGG pathway for photosynthesis (npu00195) in the overrepresentation analysis retrieved from DAVID. Polaromonas naphthalenivorans (strain CJ2) is known to metabolize naphthalene in situ [38]. We find GO terms regarding DNA repair, DNA damage and stress response as overrepresented. Earlier analyses have shown evidence that naphthalene damages DNA, membrane, and tissue [39], which is likely to explain the numerous paralogs associated with these GO terms.The subset of data presented in Table ​Table22 illustrates that key paralogs in a species are indeed related to important features of the organism, giving it a likely advantage in the competition for survival. However, in the complete table (Table S2 in Additional file 3) there are also features or functions where the link to survival is less obvious. Bartonella tribocorum (strain CIP 105476), Magnetococcus sp. (strain MC-1), Onion yellows (OY) phytoplasma, Orientia tsutsugamushi (strain Boryong and Ikeda), and Paracoccus denitrificans (strain PD1222) are often associated with GO terms for DNA methylation and alkylation. Earlier analyses have shown that DNA methylation may be a versatile regulator of virulence expression and that DNA adenine methyltransferase may have an effect on invasion into and adhesion to host cells of some but not all pathogens [40]. Methylation and the level of DNA adenine methyltransferase may also influence gene transcription, DNA mismatch repair, chromosome replication initiation, and nucleoid structure [41]. B. tribocorum, OY phytoplasma, and O. tsutsugamushi are known pathogens, while Magnetococcus sp. and P. denitrificans are not. For the pathogenic bacteria, these paralogs may therefore play a role in pathogenicity, while the reason for multiple copies of methyltransferase in the other bacteria remains unknown. A similar result was the frequent combination of GO terms for nucleus (GO:0005634) and nuclear part (GO:0044428) with Halobacterium salinarum (strain R1), Halobacterium sp., Halorubrum lacusprofundi (strain ATCC 49239), Natronomonas pharaonis, M. aeruginosa (strain NIES 843), and Photorhabdus luminescens. Since prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, this is an unexpected result. Most likely, this is a consequence of some of the paralogs in our data set having orthologs that are involved in reactions regarding nucleus in eukaryotes. This highlights an important limitation when using GO terms in automatic data analysis.A second approach to analysing the biclustering data focused on identification of possible convergent evolution. The trivial explanation for high similarity of GO terms within a cluster is of course that the genomes are closely related. It is not possible to link such similarity to adaptive processes. However, by taking the phylogenetic distances within a cluster into account we can identify clusters with high similarity of GO terms despite non-similar genomes. In other words, if a cluster from biclustering has a high internal similarity score on GO terms and a large phylogenetic distance, it is possible that there are processes stimulating some level of convergent evolution for organisms in that particular cluster.A distance matrix for all the organisms in our analyses were computed using the Kr-algorithm [42] with 16S ribosomal protein sequences as input, and by combining this information with the G-SESAME distance matrix on GO terms we were able to identify clusters with a high internal similarity score and a large phylogenetic distance. The Kr-algorithm computes distances between unaligned DNA sequences, and this is advantageous for distantly related species. The evolutionary distances estimated by the Kr-algorithm were verified by comparison to a pre-computed distance matrix from the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) [43]. Further details on this verification are given in Methods. Figure ​Figure66 shows the distribution of GO similarity scores and phylogenetic distances for all clusters. To sort out the interesting clusters, we defined a cut-off at > 0.1 for genomic distance and > 0.7 for GO similarity (see Figure ​Figure6).6). These values were estimated to be a reasonable compromise between genomic diversity, GO similarity and number of clusters returned for further analysis. This resulted in a list of 104 clusters, most of these clusters contained relatively few or rather general GO terms like catabolic process, intracellular components, membrane, biosynthetic process, and nuclease activity. A list of these clusters is given as Additional file 4, Table S3. However, there were some clusters with more specialized GO terms, and a representative subset of these is given in Table ​Table3,3, focusing on species where relevant literature data could be found. In case of overlapping clusters, the cluster with fewest organisms was included in the table. The six clusters may be briefly summarized by the descriptions metal ion binding, cell motility, glycoside hydrolase, methyltransferase, ion transport, and GTPase domain, indicating that at least some of these clusters represent interaction with the environment.Functional similarity (GO) and phylogenetic distance for all clusters. Each point represents a cluster from biclustering with similarity score over GO terms (G-SESAME) and phylogenetic distance between genomes (Kr-algorithm). Cut-off values used for identification of interesting clusters with high GO similarity and large genomic distance are indicated.A representative subset of 6 clusters with relatively specific GO termsThe cluster numbering is for local reference only. The COG classification, based on the most represented COG category in each cluster (see Methods), is shown in the heading of each cluster. The table shows GO number, description and ontology for each GO term, and name, kingdom, and group for each species.Cluster 1 includes GO terms involved in copper binding. Copper is a cofactor in a number of proteins. For copper-dependent organisms it is a challenge to keep the amount of copper at a sufficient level and at the same time to avoid a too high intracellular level which may be toxic to the organism [44]. In Dinoroseobacter shibae (strain DFL 12) the different proteins in the cluster are identified as a multicopper oxidase type 3 and a merR family transcriptional regulator. For Mycobacterium gilvum some of the proteins are cytochrome-c oxidase and copper resistance protein CopC while in N. hamburgensis we find proteins identified as cytochrome-c oxidase. The Roseobacter lineage is one of the most abundant groups of bacteria in the oceans, and D. shibae was isolated from marine dinoflagellates. M. gilvum was isolated from river sediment and N. hamburgensis has been isolated from several environments [21]. Copper is a trace metal in the ocean, and the planktonic uptake of this metal may lead to depletion of essential metals in the surface seawater [25]. D. shibae are aerobic bacteria able to perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, and are most likely to be found in the ocean surface were access to copper is scarce. The organism encodes proteins in the merR family, a group of metal ion sensing regulators that bind metals and activate the transcription of proteins involved in metal ion detoxification [45]. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the bacterium has retained multiple paralogs involved in copper binding for more efficient uptake and regulation, while the copper resistance protein CopC in M. gilvum may enhance the survival of the bacterium under extreme copper stress, as is the case e.g. with the copper resistance protein PcoC in E. coli [46]. Cytochrome-c oxidase is a large transmembrane protein involved in the respiratory electron transport chain, and the protein has two copper centres: CuA and CuB [47]. Thus the features of this cluster involve copper handling in one way or another; either as a way to gain access to scarce copper storages or as a way to resist copper poisoning.Consistent with proteome info in HAMAP [21], all of the organisms in cluster 2 have flagella. In addition to motility, the flagellum plays a key role in gene expression in many bacteria [48]. It could also play a role in other processes like adherence to host cells, host cell invasion, biofilm formation, and protein secretion [48]. For instance, a flagella-minus mutant strain of Agrobacterium tumefaciens shows attenuated virulence. It has also been shown that the flagella of Yersinia species functions as a secretion system to secrete a virulence factor [49]. Xanthomonas oryzae causes the vascular disease rice bacterial blight disease where the bacteria enter the plant through wounded leaf edges. Studies have shown that the bacteria move towards exudates of susceptible rice plants whereas no chemotaxis occurs towards exudates in resistant rice plants. This implies that chemotaxis play a role in pathogenicity before penetration of bacteria into the rice leaf. It has also been shown that mutation in one of the ORFs in the flagellar operon region in X. oryzae leads to weak chemotaxis [49,50]. After the bacteria enter the plant tissue, flagella may no longer be instrumental to virulence.The majority of proteins underlying the GO terms in cluster 3 belong to the glycoside hydrolase family. This family includes among others lysozymes, hyaluronidases, chinitases, esterases, and xylosidases [51]. The enzyme is involved in degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose, in anti-bacterial defence strategies (e.g. lysozyme), and pathogenic mechanisms (e.g. neuraminidase). Anaerocellum thermophilum (strain DSM 6725) is known to utilize a variety of polysaccharides like crystalline cellulose and hemicellulose [52], while Streptomycetes are one of the most ubiquitous soil-dwelling bacteria and degrade insoluble remains of other organisms like chitin and lignocellulose [53]. Both Sodalis glossinidus (strain morsitans) and the two strains of E. coli O157:H7 are members of the family of enterobacteriaceae and are in this cluster represented with proteins involved in degradation of cell wall, e.g. lysozyme. E. coli O157:H7 is an enterohaemorrhagic bacterium that causes haemorrhagic colitis, a major threat to human health [54] while S. glossinidus, a maternally transmitted endosymbiont, are found to infect a wide range of tissue in tsetse flies - the vector causing sleeping sickness in humans [55]. S. pyogenes belong to group A streptococcus (GAS) causing a variety of diseases with a wide range of severity in humans. The bacteria are covered with an outer capsule made of hyaluronic acid to avoid phagocytosis and to facilitate adherence to the epithelial cells [56]. Interestingly, the proteins represented in this cluster are described as hyaluronidases (some of them as phage-associated), an enzyme that degrades hyaluronic acid. The enzyme is lowering the viscosity of hyaluronic acid and thereby increasing the tissue permeability. The hyaluronic acid in the GAS capsule is shown to be structural identical to the mammalian hyaluronic acid, which is a known substrate for GAS hyaluronidase [56]. According to Starr and Engleberg [56], it has not been demonstrated experimentally that the bacterial spread in tissue is facilitated by the hyaluronidase. However, they showed that hyaluronidase may play a nutritional role for the organism under nutrient-starved conditions, making it possible to utilize host hyaluronic acid or its own capsule as a carbon energy source.Cluster 4 is represented with GO terms that involve methyltransferase activity. For O. tsutsugamushi (strain Ikeda), the proteins are classified as a N6 adenine-specific DNA-methyltransferase, and for the O. tsutsugamushi (strain Boryong and Ikeda) the proteins are described as a site-specific DNA adenine methylase. The genes from B. tribocorum are classified as helicase/methyltransferase, phage-related modification methylase and as type III restriction system methylase. In Cyanothece (strain PCC 7424) we mainly find various families of transposases while we in Frankia sp. (strain EAN1pec) mainly find DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase and transposases. Methylation of adenine or cytosine is a part of the restriction modification system in bacteria; by methylating its own DNA by the use of methyltransferases it is possible to separate this DNA from foreign DNA. The foreign DNA will not be methylated in this manner and would then be degraded by specific restriction enzymes. In this way the bacteria is protected from invasions of e.g. bacteriophages. There are certain methyltransferases that are not a part of the restriction modification system, e.g. Dam (DNA adenine methylase) in gammaproteobacteria and CcrM (Cell-cycle regulated Methyltransferase) in alphaproteobacteria. Dam catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to the N6 position of adenine in GATC sequences [40] while CcrM (with a preference for hemi-methylated DNA) methylates the sequence GANTC and has a role in cell-cycle regulation [57]. DNA cytosine methyltransferase which methylates the C-5 position of cytosine in CC(A/T)GG sequences is also not associated with any restriction enzymes [58]. These methyltransferases are part of the regulatory system in a cell, including the control of bacterial virulence; dam mutants of Salmonella enterica, Caenorhabditis elegans, Haemophilus influenzae, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Y. pestis are reported to have attenuated virulence [40,58]. Mutation in dam has also shown a reduction on invasion/adhesion to host cells in some, but not all, pathogens [40,57]. Three of the organisms in this cluster belong to the division of alphaproteobacteria where we find the CcrM protein. Adenine methylation is one of the best characterized epigenetic mechanisms for regulation of cell-cycle [59], and a mutation in ccrM is found to be lethal in A. tumefaciens, Brucella abortus, Caulobacter crescentus, and Rhizobium meliloti. Cell-cycle regulation is usually a very tightly controlled process, so in the case of methyltransferase as a cell-cycle regulator it is not clear why the organisms would benefit from more copies of this gene. It is possible that the different copies of methyltransferase may be so-called ecoparalogs; they perform the same function under different conditions, e.g. temperature or pH.The proteins behind the GO terms in cluster 5 include many iron-enterobactin ABC transporters and nitrate/nitrite transporters in E. coli K-12. This strain is found in the lower gut of animals and survives if released to the natural environment [3]. Iron is essential for almost all organisms, but the availability of iron is limited because of low solubility of Fe3+. A study by Flo et al [60] has shown that iron is sequestered by Lipocalin 2 as an immune response during infection, which subsequently limits bacterial growth. To acquire iron, the microorganisms release siderophores. Enterobactin is one of the strongest Fe3+-binding siderophores that is known today [61]. Duplication of enterobactin genes may make it possible for the organism to colonize in poor iron niches like the lower gut. In Ralstonia metallidurans (strain CH34) we find proteins described as heavy metal efflux pump, heavy metal resistance proteins, mercuric transport proteins, Hg(II) resistance protein MerP, and bacterioferritin. Heavy metal resistance is one of the main properties to the latter organism and it is therefore often found in sediments and soils with a high content of heavy metals [62]. It has been suggested that the metal resistance is an attribute of multiple layers of efflux pumps with overlapping substrate specificities [63]. In the archaea Methanosarcina barkeri (strain fusaro), a nitrogen-fixing organism originally isolated from mud samples but also reported to live in the rumen of cattle [64,65], we find e.g. molybdenum ABC transporters, iron(III) transporters and mercury ion binding proteins. Both molybdenum and iron are essential for most living organisms. Molybdenum is readily available to biological systems and is in fact the most abundant transition metal found in seawater [66]. On the other hand, the availability of Fe3+ is scarce because of limited solubility, as already mentioned. Molybdenum is shown to stimulate the diazotrophic growth in M. barkeri, indicating a molybdenum nitrogenase [67]. The duplication of molybdenum ABC transporters may enhance the ability to fixate nitrogen, while the iron(III) ABC transporters make it possible to live where iron availability is low.The protein from Borrelia burgdorferi represented in cluster 6 is described as a CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA nucleotide binding protein, and by comparing this sequence to the COG database by the use of COGnitor, the protein is classified in COG category D and described as ""ATPases involved in chromosome partitioning"". The proteins from Halobacterium sp. (strain NRC-1) are also described as different kinds of chromosome partitioning proteins (sojB, sojC, and sojD), while we in M. barkeri and Xanthobacter autotrophicus find proteins described as cobyrinic acid a, c-diamide synthase. This latter enzyme catalyzes the conversion of cobyrinic acid to cobyrinic acid a, c-diamide and is involved in the B12-pathway. Cluster 6 is an example of how this type of analysis is sensitive to the quality of sequence annotation. The proteins in this cluster belong to two different groups with respect to the type of process they are involved in; chromosome partitioning and vitamin B12 synthesis. Most of the proteins in the cluster contain a Ras-like GTPase domain, and they are therefore annotated by automatic procedures as functionally related. However, the Ras-like GTPase domain is conserved and widespread in many different proteins [68], and these proteins are not necessarily found in the same pathways. This cluster of paralogs is therefore artificially enlarged by merging together proteins that are not functionally related at a level that is relevant for this analysis.Even though the mechanisms and the functions of the proteins are not reviewed in full detail in this paper, it is clear that most of the overrepresented GO terms in these clusters can be associated with adaptation to the environment in which the organisms are living.We have used statistically overrepresented GO terms associated with duplicated genes to show that these genes often represent features that may give a competitive advantage to the particular organisms when adapting to environmental conditions. We have identified examples of unrelated prokaryotes possibly showing convergent evolution towards a shared environmental niche. We have also investigated functional differences between genes that may and may not handle gene duplication, based on functional COG classification and comparison of paralogs versus singletons. The analysis seems to confirm the hypothesis that paralogs can be associated with adaptive interactions with the environment of the prokaryote. However, the analysis also shows that incomplete or inconsistent annotation as well as ambiguous annotation terms is an important limiting factor regarding automated data analysis.897 complete prokaryotic proteomes were downloaded from NCBI ftp-server [22] in June 2009. For each proteome, a BlastP [69] search against itself was performed and the paralogs were identified using a 75% sequence identity threshold. Maximum number of Blast hits was set to 1000, unless the E-score from Blast exceeded a threshold of 10-5. The 200 organisms with the highest paralog fraction, not considering the number of copies of each paralog, were included in the main analysis. To avoid bias because of different genome sizes, the paralog fraction was defined as the ratio between the number of proteins with paralogs and the total number of proteins in each respective organism.Pairwise similarity between species was estimated as the number of common terms in the lists of overrepresented annotation terms from DAVID [26], using all terms (not only GO). In order to reduce the number of random pairwise links at least 10 common terms were required, and the overlap should cover at least 30% of the maximum possible overlap between the two species. The nodes (species) and edges (number of common terms) were loaded into Cytoscape [27], and the map layout was estimated by Cytoscape using the Edge-Weighted Spring Embedded algorithm with the number of common terms as edge weights. Alternative schemes for edge weights were tested, but this had only minor influence on the final result.The paralogs were classified into COGs according to the ptt-files at NCBI. Some paralogs could not be classified, these are registered as ""-"". Proteins that were classified in two COG categories (e.g. because of multiple domains) were registered in both categories. This paralog classification was used when comparing COG distribution of paralogs and singletons.The overall COG classification of clusters was based on the same classification as mentioned above, however this classification represents a consensus where the COG category matching the highest number of paralogs in the cluster determines the cluster classification. Additionally, for each of the GO terms included in a cluster we counted the different COG categories for all paralogs included in that GO. The GO term was then assigned a COG category according to the most frequently occurring COG group. The overall functional classification of the cluster was based on all the paralogs in the cluster, not the individual GO term classification. Therefore the overall cluster classification may differ from the COG classification associated with individual GO terms.The overrepresentation analysis was performed using three different data sets. The paranome from each organism was used as test set in all cases, whereas the three different background sets consisted of all paralogs, all proteomes, and individual proteomes.The different data sets were analysed by an overrepresentation analysis using DAVID. Only GO terms with a Bonferroni-corrected significance < 0.01 were taken into account, and the identical GO term had to be found in minimum three organisms to be included in the results. The overrepresented GO terms and organisms were clustered with the BiMax algorithm in BicAT version 2.22 [16], using default settings. Clusters for the three data sets were exported from BicAT for further analyses. Only 167 of the initial 200 organisms were included in the exported clusters; 29 of the 33 lacking organisms contained zero or only one GO term, and the remaining four organisms had a unique combination of two GO terms that were not found in other organisms, thus these organisms could not be clustered. All clusters containing only different strains of E. coli were removed from further analyses.The GO terms from the clusters were compared against itself with G-SESAME [28] (web server) which computed a similarity score based on the semantic similarity within each cluster. The average GO similarity score for each cluster was computed, and a total average similarity score was computed for each of the three background models. A box and whiskers plot based on the similarity scores was used to compare the different models (Figure ​(Figure5).5). The data set with all paralogs as background had the highest average similarity score, implying the most unambiguous clusters, thus this data set was chosen for further analyses.The Kr-algorithm version 2.0.2 [42] for alignment-free computation of evolutionary distances was used locally with default settings. FASTA sequences for 16S Ribosomal protein (frn-files) for all organisms were downloaded from the ftp-server at NCBI [22]. The first 16S ribosomal protein in each genome was used. The protein could not be found in 15 of the organisms, for these cases the ribosomal protein sequences were fetched from RDP [43]. A distance matrix for 167 organisms was computed by running the Kr-algorithm. The pre-calculated distance matrices from RDP were our initial choice, but could not be used because some of the organisms in our analyses were not included in this database. To verify that the Kr-algorithm gave evolutionary distances similar to alignment-based estimates we compared it against the RDP distance matrix. Genbank IDs for 137 of the 200 organisms could be mapped and uploaded into RDP. A pre-computed distance matrix based on the 137 organisms was downloaded. The FASTA sequences of 16S ribosomal proteins for the 137 organisms were downloaded and then used as input in Kr and a distance matrix based on this algorithm was computed. The two distance matrices, based on RDP and Kr respectively, are compared in Figure S2 in Additional file 5 and show a good correlation (r = 0.94).The project was initiated by FD. The overrepresentation analysis with DAVID was performed by BTS, DWH, and RL. Data collection and analysis was done by MSB and JJ. MSB drafted the initial manuscript, and all authors contributed to the final version. All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.The 200 organisms included in analysis.

PMC3091745,Annotation and comparative analysis of the glycoside hydrolase genes in Brachypodium distachyon,False,"Glycoside hydrolases cleave the bond between a carbohydrate and another carbohydrate, a protein, lipid or other moiety. Genes encoding glycoside hydrolases are found in a wide range of organisms, from archea to animals, and are relatively abundant in plant genomes. In plants, these enzymes are involved in diverse processes, including starch metabolism, defense, and cell-wall remodeling. Glycoside hydrolase genes have been previously cataloged for Oryza sativa (rice), the model dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and the fast-growing tree Populus trichocarpa (poplar). To improve our understanding of glycoside hydrolases in plants generally and in grasses specifically, we annotated the glycoside hydrolase genes in the grasses Brachypodium distachyon (an emerging monocotyledonous model) and Sorghum bicolor (sorghum). We then compared the glycoside hydrolases across species, at the levels of the whole genome and individual glycoside hydrolase families.We identified 356 glycoside hydrolase genes in Brachypodium and 404 in sorghum. The corresponding proteins fell into the same 34 families that are represented in rice, Arabidopsis, and poplar, helping to define a glycoside hydrolase family profile which may be common to flowering plants. For several glycoside hydrolase familes (GH5, GH13, GH18, GH19, GH28, and GH51), we present a detailed literature review together with an examination of the family structures. This analysis of individual families revealed both similarities and distinctions between monocots and eudicots, as well as between species. Shared evolutionary histories appear to be modified by lineage-specific expansions or deletions. Within GH families, the Brachypodium and sorghum proteins generally cluster with those from other monocots.This work provides the foundation for further comparative and functional analyses of plant glycoside hydrolases. Defining the Brachypodium glycoside hydrolases sets the stage for Brachypodium to be a grass model for investigations of these enzymes and their diverse roles in planta. Insights gained from Brachypodium will inform translational research studies, with applications for the improvement of cereal crops and bioenergy grasses.Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are enzymes that hydrolyze the bond between a carbohydrate and another compound, such as a second carbohydrate, a protein, or a lipid [1]. The Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) database categorizes GHs into at least 108 different families, defined by sequence similarity [1,2]. GH genes are present in a wide range of organisms from archaea and bacteria to animals and plants. Not surprisingly, given plants' photosynthetic capacity and their carbohydrate-rich cell walls, plants contain a relative abundance of genes for carbohydrate-active enzymes, including GHs [3]. Although experimental characterizations of plant GHs are limited, these enzymes have been assigned a broad array of functions. They are implicated in the defense against pathogens through attacks on the carbohydrate components of microbial cell walls, the mobilization of energy reserves through the degradation of starch, and hormone signaling through the cleavage of inactivating glycosyl groups from hormone conjugates, among many other processes [4]. Some plant GHs are thought to function in the synthesis, remodeling, and degradation of plant cell walls [4-6]. Developmental events involving cell-wall loosening or degradation include cell expansion, seed germination, lateral root emergence, stomatal formation, xylem differentiation, pollen tube growth, and fruit ripening [7-10]. The recalcitrance, or resistance to degradation, of cell walls is a major obstacle to the efficient conversion of plant feedstocks into biofuels [11]. Therefore, in addition to their roles in planta, GHs capable of modifying cell walls are also of interest for biofuel applications [5].Here, we present the annotation and analysis of GH genes in the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon (referred to hereafter as Brachypodium). Brachypodium is a small annual in the grass subfamily the Pooideae. Brachypodium's short stature; simple growth requirements; amenability to genetic transformation; and compact, sequenced genome make Brachypodium a suitable research model for its less-tractable grass relatives [12-17]. Members of the grass family, the Poaceae, provide the majority of the world's food and feed. Key crops are included in the subfamilies Ehrhartoideae (rice), Panicoideae (maize and sorghum), and Pooideae (wheat, oat, and barley) [18]. Increasingly, grasses are also being exploited for fuel: Species such as Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) are being investigated as dedicated energy crops for the production of biofuels [19,20], and crop residues from maize, rice, and wheat may also be utilized as biomass feedstocks [21]. With carbohydrates as major components of grains, fodder, and cellulosic biofuel feedstocks, a better understanding of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the grasses is needed.Genome-wide analyses of GH genes have been previously published for one grass, Oryza sativa (rice) [22], and two dicotyledonous plants, the model species Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter Arabidopsis) [23] and the fast-growing tree Populus trichocarpa (poplar) [24]. Comparisons between Arabidopsis and rice or Arabidopsis and poplar have been used to draw conclusions about the evolutionary history of GHs or differences in the GH profiles of large plant groups. For example, Arabidopsis and rice GH28 family members were compared to estimate the number of GH28 genes in the common ancestor of these divergent species [25]. Also, differences in the number of GHs between Arabidopsis and rice or poplar have been hypothesized to reflect differences in the GH profiles of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants (Arabidopsis versus rice) [22] or herbaceous and woody plants (Arabidopsis versus poplar) [24]. The sequencing of additional plant genomes allows such comparisons to be extended to more species, increasing the robustness of the analyses by reinforcing the conclusions or by identifying over-generalizations from pairwise comparisons. To improve our understanding of plant GHs generally and grass GHs specifically, we have annotated both the Brachypodium and Sorghum bicolor (sorghum) GHs and compared them to the GHs from rice, Arabidopsis, and poplar. When significant differences between the grasses and eudicots were identified, we broadened the analysis to include GHs from other species (maize, wheat, soybean, Medicago, castor bean, tomato, etc.) with significant, but variable, available sequence resources. This large-scale analysis will help guide research into this important group of enzymes.Rice and Arabidopsis GH protein sequences were retrieved from the CAZy database [1,2] and used as queries in BLASTp searches [26] of the version 1.0 predicted proteome of Brachypodium, including splice variants [27]. Additional files 1 and 2 list rice and Arabidopsis GH sequences, respectively. The E-value cut-off was set to 10-10. For GH families with no known rice or Arabidopsis representatives, the Brachypodium predicted proteome was searched using another, usually microbial, GH sequence selected from the CAZy list. Using the Pfam database [28,29], each candidate Brachypodium GH was analyzed for the presence of a predicted GH domain. The Pfam domain predictions are listed in additional file 3. To further confirm GH family assignments, Brachypodium GH sequences were used as queries in tBLASTn searches against GenBank entries, March to May, 2009 [30]. Each gene model was then individually examined using expressed sequence tag (EST), Illumina transcriptome, and splice-junction data, as well as predicted alternative transcripts, for Brachypodium (available at http://www.brachypodium.org) [27,31]; relevant gene models from Arabidopsis and rice (accessible at http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/plant/jsf/brachypodium/index.jsp) [27,32]; and Pfam domain predictions, to decide whether and how a Brachypodium gene model could be improved through manual modifications. The few Brachypodium GH models which were modified are indicated with an ""m"" beside the gene name in additional file 3. The modifications and modified sequences are listed in additional file 4.To search for GH genes possibly omitted from the version 1.0 annotation, Brachypodium EST sequences, including Sanger and 454 sequencing reads as well as the TAU models built from Illumina short reads [27], were mapped onto the unmasked Brachypodium genome sequence [27] using BLAT [33] with a minimum identity of 92%. Only the ""best match"" position was selected as the genomic location for each query EST sequence. Gene models were then predicted using Augustus [34], with the genomic locations of the Brachypodium ESTs as extrinsic evidence. The protein sequences of predicted Brachypodium gene models were compared with Arabidopsis (version 8 [35]) and rice genome annotations (version 6 [36]) using BLASTp [37]. For motif analysis, protein sequences were scanned for domains using blastprodom, coils, gene3d, hmmpanther, hmmpir, hmmpfam, hmmsmart, hmmtigr, fprintscan, patternscan, profilescan, and superfamily implemented in InterPro [38-41]. The resulting candidate GHs were individually evaluated, as described above, for possible improvements to the gene models. The GH genes identified in this analysis of the unmasked genome are noted in additional file 4. Protein sequences for all the Brachypodium GHs are listed in additional file 5.Sorghum GHs were identified in the same way, except that rice, Arabidopsis, and Brachypodium GH protein sequences were used as queries in BLASTp searches of the Sbi1_4 version (Sorbi1_GeneModels_Sbi1_4_aa.fasta.gz) [42] of the predicted proteome of sorghum [43]. In contrast to the analysis performed for Brachypodium, sorghum GH gene models were not systematically evaluated for potential errors, nor did we search for GH genes not contained in the annotation. Additional files 6 and 7 list the sorghum GHs and their protein sequences.Full-length GH protein sequences from Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar were used as the basis for constructing phylogenetic trees. Arabidopsis and rice sequences were accessed through the CAZy database [1,2]. Brachypodium and sorghum GH sequences were identified in this study, and poplar GH sequences were identified via BLASTp searches of the version 1.1 Populus proteome (proteins.Poptr1_1.JamboreeModels) [44,45], using Arabidopsis and rice GH proteins as queries. GH sequences from additional species (maize, wheat, soybean, castor bean, grape, tomato, Medicago, strawberry, etc.) were later incorporated into selected trees. These additional sequences were either downloaded from the CAZy database, identified by querying GenBank [30,46] from November of 2009 through May of 2010 with known GH sequences, or retrieved from the research literature. Sequences were aligned by ClustalW [47] using default parameters (a Gonnet protein weight matrix and gap-opening penalties of 10 and gap-extending penalties of 0.1 and 0.2 for pair-wise and multiple alignments, respectively) implemented in the MEGA4 program [48]. The ClustalW alignments were manually examined and found to be highly accurate. Thus, no manual adjustments were made except for the elimination of entire proteins that appeared to be truncated or otherwise incorrectly annotated. Phylogenetic analyses were performed in MEGA4, using the Neighbor-Joining method [49] and 1,000 bootstrap replicates [50] for each analysis. Pairwise deletion was employed to address alignment gaps and missing data.To identify candidate Brachypodium GHs, BLASTp searches [26] of the version 1.0 Brachypodium predicted proteome [27] were performed using rice and Arabidopsis GH sequences as queries. The resulting candidates were compared against the Pfam protein families database [28] to detect protein domains. Brachypodium proteins without predicted GH domains were removed from consideration, with the following exceptions: one Brachypodium GH33 and two GH95 members were considered to be GHs because the Pfam database does not contain a specific entry for either a GH33 or a GH95 domain. In these cases, we relied on the Brachypodium proteins' high sequence similarity to rice and Arabidopsis family members. Two of the five Brachypodium GH27 family members lacked a significant match to a Pfam GH domain but were nevertheless considered to be GHs because they are highly similar to rice and Arabidopsis GH27 family members which also lack a predicted Pfam GH domain. After modification of the gene model, one additional gene (Bradi1g27870) was determined to encode a GH16 protein. These analyses identified 340 Brachypodium GH genes. Since the version 1.0 annotation, based on a repeat-masked Brachypodium genomic sequence, was missing genes in other families, such as the F-box family [27], we also searched for Brachypodium GH genes in the unmasked genome, using an annotation pipeline based on transcriptome expression evidence as well as a protein domain search. This secondary search yielded an additional 16 Brachypodium GHs. In total, 356 Brachypodium genes in 34 GH families were identified; the full list is given in additional file 3. Protein sequences for the Brachypodium GHs are listed in additional file 5.The gene models for all of the Brachypodium GHs were examined for possible improvements. Of the 356 GH gene models, 14 (3.9%) were modified based on criteria such as EST data and gene models from other species. Additional file 4 details the modifications and additions made to version 1.0 of the Brachypodium genome annotation. Nearly 80% of the Brachypodium GH genes were supported by EST and/or Illumina transcriptome data (additional file 3) [27]. The limited changes compared to the version 1.0 annotation and the large proportion of genes with expression support testify to the high quality of the initial genome annotation.Approximately 84% of identified Brachypodium GHs had good matches (E-value ≤ 10-100) in both rice and Arabidopsis (additional file 3). Another 14% of Brachypodium GHs matched both rice and Arabidopsis GH sequences with an E-value ≤ 10-10. Only 7 Brachypodium GHs - in the GH5, GH16, and GH18 families - were good matches to rice GHs but lacked clear Arabidopsis orthologs (additional file 3). As discussed below, these GH5 and GH18 sequences represent major clades which are missing in Arabidopsis. No Brachypodium GHs were found outside the families represented in rice and Arabidopsis, despite our queries using GHs from other organisms.A similar approach was used to identify sorghum GHs: rice, Arabidopsis, and Brachypodium GH protein sequences were used as queries in BLASTp searches of the sorghum predicted proteome [43], and the resulting candidates were analyzed for the presence of Pfam-predicted GH domains [28]. Sorghum was found to have 404 GHs in the same 34 families that are represented in Arabidopsis, rice, and Brachypodium (Figure ​(Figure11 and additional file 8). Additional files 6 and 7 include the full list of sorghum GHs and their corresponding protein sequences.Number of GH family members in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum. GH families are indicated on the x-axis, with the number of family members in each species indicated on the y-axis. Numbers in parentheses in the figure key indicate the total number of GH genes in each species.To compare GH profiles across plant species, we retrieved the numbers of GH family members in both Arabidopsis and rice from the CAZy database [1,2]. The number of gene family members was updated as follows: one putative GH28 gene (At1g23470) was removed from the Arabidopsis list, because At1g23470 is annotated as a pseudogene in the most recent, TAIR9, release of the Arabidopsis genome [35]. The number of rice genes in four families was reduced because several genes were listed multiple times. The GH5 gene Os10g0370800 was listed three times, the GH16 gene Os08g0240500 twice, and the GH17 gene Os01g0947000 twice. Two CAZy entries for the rice GH32 family [GenBank: {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AAD10239.1"",""term_id"":""4102982"",""term_text"":""AAD10239.1""}}AAD10239.1 and {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AAK72492.2"",""term_id"":""31088946"",""term_text"":""AAK72492.2""}}AAK72492.2] correspond to genes already included in the list; we therefore considered these entries to be duplicates. Also, two fragmentary rice sequences [GenBank: {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""BAA01617.1"",""term_id"":""287407"",""term_text"":""BAA01617.1""}}BAA01617.1 and {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""BAG87724.1"",""term_id"":""215686463"",""term_text"":""BAG87724.1""}}BAG87724.1] were removed from the GH13 and GH36 families, respectively.Overall, Brachypodium and sorghum have similar numbers of GHs as rice and Arabidopsis. The 356 GHs in Brachypodium represent 1.4% of the 25,532 predicted protein-coding genes [27], while the 404 GHs in sorghum correspond to 1.5% of the 27,640 protein-coding genes [43]. This is in comparison to 390 GHs in Arabidopsis (1.4% of the 27,379 TAIR9 protein-coding genes) [35] and 414 GHs in rice (1.4% of the 30,192 RAP2 protein-coding genes) [51,52].Despite the global similarity in the total number of GHs, the number of members in individual GH families varies widely. For Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum, the number of GHs in each family is shown graphically in Figure ​Figure11 and numerically in additional file 8. Some families - e.g. GH2, 9, 10, 37, 43, 77, and 100 - contain similar numbers of members in each of the four species. In other families - e.g. GH1, 5, 13, 18, 19, 28, and 51 - the number of members differs by up to four-fold (Figure ​(Figure11 and additional file 8). Previous studies have detected some of these differences. For example, the GH28 family of polygalacturonases is larger in Arabidopsis (66 genes) than rice (41 genes); conversely, the GH18 family of chitinases is much larger in rice (34 genes) than Arabidopsis (10 genes) [22] (Figure ​(Figure11 and additional file 8). However, with such pairwise comparisons of species, it has been difficult to evaluate whether differences represent variation between major groups, such as dicots and monocots, or merely between the two species examined. For many GH families, the Brachypodium and sorghum data are largely consistent with those for rice. The identification of 41 GH28 members in Brachypodium and 38 in sorghum supports the idea that grasses contain fewer polygalacturonases than eudicots do. In other cases, such as the GH18 family, the trend breaks down: Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum have 10, 34, 14, and 25 GH18 genes, respectively (Figure ​(Figure11 and additional file 8). This observation highlights the danger of making large taxonomic generalizations based on pairwise comparisons.The unusually high number of GH genes reported for poplar (600 genes) [24] complicates global comparisons with other species; some of the poplar gene models may actually be annotation artifacts arising from the heterozygous nature of the large, complex, and duplicated poplar genome. Whereas multiple rounds of computational and manual improvements have resulted in high-quality Arabidopsis and rice gene models [35,36,52], the sorghum and poplar models are ""first drafts"" derived from computational predictions, gene homology, and expression data [43,45]. Future refinements of the sorghum and poplar gene models may therefore alter the number of GHs, as well as the corresponding protein sequences, in these species. In fact, while cataloging carbohydrate-active enzymes in poplar, Geisler-Lee et al. found that some models were fragmentary and should be merged into larger genes [24].For detailed analyses of specific GH families, poplar sequences were retrieved via BLASTp searches of the version 1.1 Populus proteome with Arabidopsis and rice GH proteins as queries. The searches yielded non-identical, although largely overlapping, sets of poplar GH candidates. For example, poplar reportedly has 22 GH5 family members, identified via BLAST searches using all entries in the CAZy database [24]. Our searches of the poplar proteome using the Arabidopsis GH sequences identified 17 poplar GH5s; searches using the rice GHs identified an additional 5 poplar GH5 proteins, for a total of 22. These results are consistent with the finding of Tuskan et al. that almost 12% of predicted poplar genes did not have clear orthologs in Arabidopsis [45].Poplar was not known to have any members in the GH33 and GH85 families [24]. Although the GH33 and GH85 families are small, with one to two members each in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum (Figure ​(Figure11 and additional file 8), it was surprising that poplar would completely lack representatives of these families. Interestingly, our searches identified one poplar GH33 gene (Poptr825914) and three poplar GH85 genes (Poptr226914, Poptr226918, and Poptr419935). (See the additional file 9 for the full gene names and sequences.) The poplar GH33 was an especially good match - with an E-value of 10-147 - to the rice GH33, Os07g0516000. The Pfam database does not list a specific GH33 domain, and, correspondingly, Poptr825914 and the GH33 family members in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum do not have any significant matches to Pfam GH domains. However, analyzing the Poptr825914 protein with the InterProScan feature of the InterPro database [40] identified a sialidase domain, which is characteristic of the GH33 family [2]. The three poplar GH85 proteins, Poptr226914, Poptr226918, and Poptr419935, were all retrieved as matches to Arabidopsis and rice GH85 sequences, and all contain a characteristic, Pfam-predicted Glycosyl hydrolase family 85 domain.The identification of GH33 and GH85 members in poplar means that poplar has the same GH families which are present in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum. The presence of these families in five, diverse flowering plant species, combined with the apparent absence of plant sequences from other families, suggests that these 34 GH families are common to angiosperms.To further elucidate the relationships between plant GHs, we selected several families for phylogenetic analyses. Full-length protein sequences from five species - Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar - served as the basis for building phylogenetic trees. Making the trees with full-length sequences allowed all the information contained in the protein sequences to contribute to the phylogenetic placement of the genes. To be sure that this overall evolutionary history agreed with the GH domain alone, we also constructed trees based only on the GH domains (not shown). For the GH18, GH19, GH5, GH28, and GH13 families, the domain-only trees had the same structure as the trees based on the full-length sequences. For the GH51 family, the bootstrap values in the domain-only tree were too low to be informative for distinguishing the highly-similar sequences. Thus, in this case, the sequence outside the GH domain was crucial for teasing out the relationship between the proteins. To enrich the investigation, sequences from other organisms were included for some of the GH families. These evolutionary analyses, performed with the MEGA4 program [48], emphasize comparisons between eudicots and grasses, especially the model plants Arabidopsis and Brachypodium.Chitin, a long-chain polymer of beta-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) linkages, is the second-most-abundant carbohydrate in nature after cellulose. It forms the major component of fungal cell walls and is also found in the exoskeletons of insects and shells of mollusks [53]. Chitinases are enzymes that break down chitin by hydrolyzing this polysaccharide into simple sugars, and chitinolytic enzymes have been identified in viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoan parasites, insects, animals, and plants [1,30]. Chitin is not synthesized in plants. However, expression of several plant chitinases is induced by pathogen challenge, and these proteins make up five of the seventeen families of plant pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins: PR2, PR3, and PR4 are GH19 family members, and PR8 and PR11 are GH18 family members [4,54]. This implicates chitinases as key plant-defense proteins. Numerous studies have demonstrated that chitinases have both antifungal and antibacterial activities [55-61]. Environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, frost, wounding and osmotic pressure also can induce chitinase expression in plants. Other studies suggest that chitinases likely play a role in growth, development, and the generation or degradation of signaling molecules [62-66]. Nod factors produced by nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria include chitin oligomers of four or five N-acetyl glucosamine residues that can be cleaved and inactivated by specific plant chitinases, revealing a role for these proteins in symbiosis. It is not surprising, then, that plant genomes contain a large number of chitinase genes, the majority of which are classified in the GH18 and GH19 families. Together these two families comprise 24 genes in Brachypodium, 42 in sorghum, 50 in rice, 24 in Arabidopsis and 56 in poplar (additional files 8 and 9).Despite shared chitinolytic activity, the GH18 and GH19 families do not share sequence similarity. The two families are clearly distinguished by their sequences and three-dimensional structures, indicating they are derived from different ancestral genes. The GH18 and GH19 plant chitinases are further divided into seven classes (I-VII) based on amino acid sequence and the presence or absence of auxiliary domains flanking a catalytic domain [67,68]. The GH18 family includes the class III and class V chitinases that are more closely related to fungal enzymes involved in morphogenesis (class III) and bacterial exochitinases (class V) than they are to GH19 proteins [67]. The GH18 domain is an eight-stranded β/α barrel with a pronounced active-site cleft at the C-terminal end of the β-barrel and a conserved DXXDXDXE motif [69,70]. GH18 class III chitinases can have dual lysozyme and chitinase functions, and these dual-function proteins tend to be better-targeted at murein in bacterial cell walls than the other classes of chitinases [4]. The GH18 family also includes a number of ""inactivated"" chitinases which represent evolutionary adaptations that recruit the ancient and stable GH18 scaffold to novel functions. These include GH18 xylanase inhibitor proteins (XIPs) that lack chitinolytic activity but have adapted a new defense mechanism targeting the pathogen-produced GH10 and GH11 xylanases that degrade arabinoxylans in plant cell walls [69,71]. Nodulins, involved in interactions with symbiotic bacteria, as well as narbonins and concanavalin B, seed proteins lacking conserved catalytic residues, also group within the GH18 family [67,69].A phylogenetic analysis of the GH18 proteins from 23 plant species is presented in Figure ​Figure22 and additional file 10. The Neighbor-Joining tree was generated using 1000 bootstrap replicates and includes 8 monocot (Brachypodium, rice, sorghum, bamboo, tulip, bread wheat, durum wheat, and maize) and 15 eudicot (Arabidopsis, poplar, sugar beet, longleaf ironwood, jelly fig, strawberry, soy bean, white lupine, Medicago, a legume, winged bean, ginseng, adzuki bean, cowpea, and grape) species. For the scientific names of species in this tree, see additional file 11. Sequences within this family resolve into four distinct, well-supported clades. The class V chitinases group into a single clade that shares little sequence similarity with the class III proteins. Monocot and eudicot sequences group separately within the class V clade. Brachypodium and rice each have one representative in this group and sorghum has two; interestingly, class V chitinases have not been reported in maize [55]. Compared to these monocots, the eudicots Arabidopsis and poplar have greater representation in the class V clade. This is explained by local duplications resulting in expansion of class V chitinases in these species.The GH18 chitinase family. The tree includes GH18 proteins from 23 species: Arabidopsis (AT), rice, Brachypodium (Bradi), sorghum, and poplar, as well as sequences from 13 other eudicots (sugar beet, longleaf ironwood, jelly fig, strawberry, soybean, white lupine, Medicago, a legume, winged bean, ginseng, adzuki bean, cowpea, and grape) and 5 other monocots (bamboo, bread wheat, wild tulip, durum wheat, and maize). The tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The percent of bootstrap replicates supporting each major branch is indicated. Distances are proportional to the number of amino-acid substitutions per site. Sequences from eudicots are indicated in blue (Arabidopsis with filled triangles, other eudicots with open triangles); sequences from monocots are indicated in red (Brachypodium with filled circles, other monocots with open circles). For clarity, gene names or accession numbers are shown only for Arabidopsis and Brachypodium. Chitinase class designations are listed by each clade and specific XIPs are labeled. For complete branch labels and bootstrap values, see additional file 10.GH18 class III chitinases are divided between the remaining three clades of the tree. Initially, we aligned sequences from Brachypodium, rice, sorghum, Arabidopsis, and poplar, and in the analysis of these data, two clades comprised only grass sequences (data not shown). These sequences were used to query the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) non-redundant protein sequence database [30] in order to expand the number of species represented. The retrieved proteins from both monocot and eudicot species were used in combination with the original set to construct a new tree. The majority of the retrieved eudicot sequences aligned with the sequences in the class IIIa group that contains the only Arabidopsis class III protein. In this clade, the monocot and dicot sequences are mixed, rather than forming two distinct groupings as seen for the class V proteins (Figure ​(Figure22).The class IIIb clade in Figure ​Figure22 was proposed by Suzukawa et al. (2003) [72] in studies of a tulip-bulb chitinase and was also used by Shoresh and Harmon (2008) [55] to describe a group of maize GH18 proteins. In our original tree, this group contained only monocot sequences; yet it is closely related to the GH18 narbonin and nodulin-like proteins. Narbonin is a globulin protein from the eudicot Vicia narbonensis that lacks conserved chitinase catalytic residues and enzymatic activity. In legumes such as fava bean and soybean, nodulins are induced in response to signals generated by symbiotic bacteria. These are eudicot species, and therefore, it was apparent that we needed to expand our dataset to get a better understanding of the proteins that cluster with the narbonin and nodulin proteins and the neighboring class IIIb group. A BLASTp search retrieved a variety of eudicot sequences that group within the IIIb clade. Soresh and Harmon had compared maize sequences only to rice, tulip, and Arabidopsis and concluded that class IIIb is monocot-specific, because the only dicot considered, Arabidopsis, did not have a representative in the IIIb group. Our original tree included poplar, which also lacks a class IIIb protein. However, the presence of several eudicot class IIIb sequences in our expanded tree (Figure ​(Figure22 and additional file 10) illustrates the need for caution when drawing conclusions based on data from a few species. The narbonin and nodulin nucleotide sequences do not encode predicted signal peptides. In their analysis of one tulip, two rice, and three maize class IIIb proteins, Soresh and Harmon reported that these sequences also lack signal peptides. We used Signal P and Sig-Pred software to evaluate signal peptide predictions for the Brachypodium and sorghum GH18 proteins and found that the Bradi3g26840, Bradi3g26850, and Sb5g006880 sequences in the class IIIb clade lack predicted signal peptides. However, the class IIIb proteins Bradi3g26810 and Sb01g21920, as well as all of the other Brachypodium and sorghum GH18 proteins, do contain predicted signal peptides.The remainder of the class III chitinases form a distinct clade that remains monocot-specific even after the addition of BLASTp-retrieved monocot and eudicot sequences to the phylogenetic analysis. These proteins have been grouped with the class IIIa chitinases; however, they can be clearly distinguished from the class IIIa chitinases by sequence and functional characteristics. This distinct clade represents a group of xylanase inhibitor proteins (XIPs) that have lost chitinolytic activity and have gained the ability to inhibit the GH10 and GH11 xylanases used by pathogens to attack plant cell walls [69,71]. XIPs for which reports have been published, wheat XIP-I and XIP-III [73], wheat XIP-RI and XIP-RII [56], and rice RIXI [69], are labeled in Figure ​Figure2.2. In our analysis, the clade containing these sequences is referred to as class IIIa-XIP. The class IIIa-XIP chitinases have a modified version of the DXXDXDXE motif that is required for catalytic activity. In XIPs, the third D is usually mutated to an aromatic residue (F or Y). In addition, these proteins contain two mutations introducing R residues at positions C-terminal to the DXXDXDXE motif that can form salt bridges with the conserved E residue. This interaction blocks the chitin-binding site, preventing chitinase activity [56,69]. The sorghum and maize proteins within the clusters containing RIXI, XIP-RI, XIP-RII, and XIPI all contain the characteristic XIP mutations. All of the Brachypodium sequences within the class IIIa-XIP clade also have these changes, suggesting that they may function as XIPs, whereas the Brachypodium class IIIa and IIIb sequences do not contain these mutations (Figure ​(Figure3).3). Bradi4g09420 contains the two R mutations, but in place of the active site mutation, it has a large deletion through the chitin-binding domain, entirely eliminating the DXXDXDXE motif in this protein. This deletion is unique among the proteins included in the class IIIa-XIP clade. The cluster of the class IIIa-XIP clade that does not contain a Brachypodium representative also appears to consist of XIP proteins. Most of the rice, sorghum, and maize sequences within this group have the three described XIP substitutions; however, a few sequences have variations. The Os05g0247100, Os05g0247500, Os05g0248200 sequences have an additional N substitution in place of the first D in the catalytic motif. Os11g002200 has an A instead of the first R, and Os05g0247100, Os05g0247500, Os05g0248200 each have a K instead of the second R (Figure ​(Figure33 and data not shown). The considerable number of sequences for each species represented in this clade is mainly explained by a large number of local duplications of class IIIa-XIP genes. The evolution of XIP proteins from class III chitinases appears to represent a successful functional adaptation specific to monocots, and, in this analysis, particularly for grasses.Alignment of GH18 class III chitinase sequences. Forty sequences were selected from the one hundred fourteen class IIIa, IIIa-XIP, and IIIb sequences used to construct the GH18 family phylogenetic tree. The selected proteins include the experimentally verified wheat (Ta) and rice (Os) proteins. All of the Brachypodium (Bradi) class III proteins were included in the alignment along with sorghum (Sb) and rice proteins selected to represent branches of the class III clades. The sequences were aligned using the Clustal W method in MegAlign 5.05 (DNAStar software package). The region presented includes the DXXDXDXE motif (within the blue box) required for chitinolytic activity and two residues (within the red boxes) that in most of the IIIa-XIP sequences contain amino acids (R or K) capable of forming salt bridges with the E in the DXXDXDXE motif. The class IIIa-XIP protein Bradi4g09429 contains a large N-proximal deletion, and the first amino acid shown is at position 33 in the sequence. The position of the first amino acid shown ranges from positions 139 to 159 for the other class IIIa-XIP proteins, from positions 139 to150 for class IIIa, and from positions 125 to 149 for class IIIb.The functional adaptations within the GH18 family highlight the challenges of assigning protein functions based solely on sequence similarities. Numerous studies have been performed to identify the targets of class III chitinases. Chitinases have different substrate specificities, activities, reaction mechanisms, and expression patterns. Activity and substrate specificity are diverse even among identical classes of enzymes. For example, two of the rice class IIIb proteins, Os10g0416500 and Os10g0416800, have highly similar sequences. Yet Os10g0416500 is expressed in response to pathogen challenge and has substantial antifungal activity, whereas Os10g0416800 is expressed in response to environmental stresses [59]. Through the comparison of increasing numbers of chitinase sequences, however, new groups emerge, such as the class IIIa-XIP proteins, and functional predictions based on sequence patterns begin to become possible.The GH19 family is found primarily in plants, but members have been identified in a number of bacteria and in nematodes [1]. Analyses of GH19 proteins reveal structural similarities with lysozymes, despite a lack of significant sequence similarity, and suggest that these two enzyme groups arose from a common ancestor originating before the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes [30]. The chitinase classes represented in the GH19 family (I, II, IV, VI, and VII) are distinguished by characteristic small deletions in the sequence and by the presence of auxiliary domains flanking the main catalytic domain, including a cysteine-rich chitin-binding domain (CRD or CBD), a proline- and glycine-rich hinge region, and a carboxy-terminal extension (CTE) [55,67,74].A phylogenetic analysis of the GH19 proteins from five plant species is presented in Figure ​Figure44 and additional file 12. The Neighbor-Joining tree includes three grass (Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum) and two eudicot (Arabidopsis and poplar) species. The sequences within this family are resolved into four distinct, well-supported clades (Figure ​(Figure4).4). We used the designated chitinase classes for the Arabidopsis GH19 proteins [35,75] and the sequence alignment generated for this tree to assign chitinase classes to Brachypodium proteins with similar arrangements of auxiliary domains and deletion patterns. Class designations for the Brachypodium and Arabidopsis sequences are indicated by Roman numerals within Figure ​Figure4.4. Three of the clades contain sequences primarily from a single chitinase class, II, IV, or VI, whereas one clade contains sequences mixed between classes I and II. Sequences for classes I and II, although similar, are distinguished by the absence of the CRD and the CTE and a small deletion in the catalytic domain in the class II proteins. Placement in previous phylogenetic analyses also suggests that class II proteins have polyphyletic origins, arising multiple times within class I lineages [67]. Two of the Brachypodium sequences in this clade have notable differences from the classic representatives of their assigned classes. Bradi2g26000 has a large CRD containing 16 cysteine residues, twice the usual number, and may represent two tandem CRDs. Bradi1g29880 looks like a class II protein but lacks the signal peptide usually found in this class. One class VII protein, At3g47540, resides within the class IV clade. In addition to the two deletions in the catalytic domain that are characteristic of the class IV proteins, this protein also lacks CRD and CTE regions. Previously, classes II and IV were reported to be found mainly in dicots [67]. However, the three grass species included in this analysis, Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum, each have representatives in the clades containing these class II and IV chitinases, suggesting that monocot sequences have been heretofore under-represented in these classes. There are few examples of class VI and VII proteins in the literature, and we identified only one class VI and no class VII proteins amongst the Brachypodium chitinases. Class VI chitinases have an arrangement of auxiliary domains similar to class I proteins but contain a CRD with fewer cysteine residues than the class I domain, as well as variations in the hinge and CTE regions. One of the Arabidopsis proteins designated class VI in this analysis, At1g05850, earlier was reported to be a class VII protein [75]. However, At1g05850 lacks the catalytic-domain deletions characteristic of the class IV and VII proteins. As more sequences from additional species are added to such analyses, a clearer picture of the profiles of these families emerges.The GH19 chitinase family. The tree includes GH19 proteins from five species: Arabidopsis (AT), rice, Brachypodium (Bradi), sorghum, and poplar. Tree construction is as in Figure 2. Sequences from eudicots are indicated in blue (Arabidopsis with filled triangles, poplar with open triangles); sequences from grasses are indicated in red (Brachypodium with filled circles, rice and sorghum with open circles). For clarity, gene names or accession numbers are shown only for Arabidopsis and Brachypodium. Chitinase class designations are listed by each clade and are indicated next each of the Arabidopsis and Brachypodium proteins. For complete branch labels and bootstrap values, see additional file 12.Each clade of the GH19 family contains at least one representative from all five species analyzed; however, the grass and eudicot sequences group as separate clusters within the clades (Figure ​(Figure44 and additional file 12). The difference in the number of genes between species is primarily due to localized, tandem duplications of sequences within the two larger clades. Three good examples are the five Arabidopsis genes (At2g43580, At2g43590, At2g43600, At2g43610, and At2g43620); six sorghum genes (Sb06g021210, Sb06g021220, Sb06g021230, Sb06g021240, Sb06g021250, and Sb06g021260); and four poplar genes (Poptr249950, Poptr547380, Poptr249966, and Poptr826290) present in the class IV clade. Additionally, the clade with mixed class I and II sequences shows expansions in two Brachypodium regions (Bradi1g29880 and Bradi1g29890, as well as Bradi2g47190 and Bradi2g47210); one poplar region (Poptr557015, Poptr557013, Poptr649160, Poptr72170, Poptr 72160, Poptr649163, and Poptr200449); and two rice regions (Os05g0399300, Os05g0399400, and Os05g0399700, as well as Os06g726100 and Os06g726200). One possible explanation for this observation is proposed by Bishop et al. [76] as a result of their analyses of the PR proteins represented by the GH19 class I chitinases [67]. These researchers observed that the GH19 proteins disproportionately accumulate adaptive mutations in the active-site cleft. This unusual pattern of mutation is not shared by chitinases of the GH18 family, suggesting that adaptive functional modifications rapidly emerge as a result of direct pathogen defense against plant chitinolytic activity. This plant-pathogen coevolution of GH19 genes could be facilitated by the observed gene duplications: Mutations in the additional gene copies could confer adaptive advantages in the face of attacks by a variety of pathogens.The GH5 family, previously named cellulase family A, includes plant-cell-wall-modifying enzymes such as cellulases, mannanases, and β-glucosidases [1,2,4,5]. The enzymatic activities of a few plant GH5 members have been characterized. One of these is HvMAN1, a mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) from barley (Hordeum vulgare) [77]. Purified from 10-day-old seedlings, HvMAN1 exhibited relatively high rates of hydrolysis on moderately substituted galactomannan and unsubstituted glucomannan substrates [77]. Another mannanase, LeMAN4a, expressed in ripenning tomato (Solanum lycopersicon, syn. Lycopersicon esculentum), was also cloned, its endo- β-D-mannanase activity confirmed in an in vitro assay, and its structure solved [78,79]. RNA-mediated suppression of LeMAN4a expression slightly increased the firmness of ripening tomato fruits, suggesting that LeMAN4a plays a supporting role in fruit softening [80]. The rice GH5BG gene (Os10g0370500) encodes a GH5 family β-glucosidase that is expressed in the shoots of seedlings and leaf sheaths of adult plants [81]. Salt stress, submergence, and the stress hormones methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid induced the expression of GH5BG, hinting at a possible connection between GH5BG-mediated cell-wall remodeling and responses to environmental conditions [81].To obtain a more complete picture of the plant GH5 family, GH5 sequences from other plants (barley, maize, wheat, tomato, coffee, soybean, apple, peach, tomato, grape, etc.) and from green algae (Micromonas and Ostreococcus species) were retrieved from the CAZy database or, in the case of HvMAN1, from the research literature. (For a full list of species, see additional file 11.) These protein sequences were combined with the Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar GH5 sequences to build an evolutionary tree. The plant GH5 proteins formed three major clades, A, B, and C, with high bootstrap support (Figure ​(Figure55 and additional file 13). The mannanases HvMAN1 and LeMAN4a are in clade A, while the β-glucosidase GH5BG is in clade B (Figure ​(Figure5).5). Initially, clade B appeared to contain only monocot sequences and one sequence from a gymnosperm, sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). However, tBLASTn searches of GenBank using the two Brachypodium clade B representatives yielded additional members from dicotyledonous species: poplar, castor bean, tomato, and grape (Figure ​(Figure5).5). For complete information on species included in the tree and branch labels, see additional files 11 and 13. Strikingly, the Arabidopsis GH5 proteins fall within Clades A and C, but not B (Figure ​(Figure5).5). Performing tBLASTn searches of the Arabidopsis transcriptome (TAIR9) [35] using the Brachypodium and eudicot Clade B members as queries yielded no Clade B matches, confirming the lack of an Arabidopsis Clade B representative. Sequences from green algae (Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Ostreococcus tauri, and Micromonas) cluster with clades A and B with 100% and 98% bootstrap support, respectively (Figure ​(Figure5).5). This finding suggests that both the A and B clades arose early in evolution. The absence of Arabidopsis from clade B, a group spanning diverse plant species, underscores the point that, although Arabidopsis is a powerful tool, it is not sufficient for studying all aspects of plants. Multi-species comparisons are needed to form a comprehensive picture.The GH5 family of putative cell-wall-modifying enzymes. The tree includes GH5 proteins from 28 species: Arabidopsis (AT), rice, Brachypodium (Bradi), sorghum, and poplar, as well as 14 additional eudicot species, five additional monocot species, a gymnosperm, and three species of green algae. Tree construction and color-coding (blue for eudicots and red for monocots) are as in Figure 2. A light blue diamond indicates the single gymnosperm sequence; green squares indicate green algal sequences. The three major plant clades, A, B, and C, are marked with dotted, gray lines. Small gray arrows indicate HvMAN1 (Hor vul {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ABC87082.1"",""term_id"":""86169677"",""term_text"":""ABC87082.1""}}ABC87082.1), LeMAN4a (Sol lyc {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AAK97760.1"",""term_id"":""15529113"",""term_text"":""AAK97760.1""}}AAK97760.1), and GH5BG (Os10g0370500).

RCC299; Ost luc: Ostreococcus lucimarinus; Ost tau: Ostreococcus tauri; Pic sit: Picea sitchensis. For complete branch labels and bootstrap values, see additional file 13.The GH28 family includes polygalacturonases, which act on pectin [1,2,4]. Pectin consists of carbohydrate polymers (e.g. homogalacturonans and rhamnogalacturonans) rich in galacturonic acid [82]. Pectin is a major component of the middle lamella connecting adjacent plant cells to each other [9,82]. In eudicots such as Arabidopsis, pectin is also abundant in primary cell walls, where it forms a matrix surrounding the network of cellulose and hemicellulose [82,83]. GH28 polygalacturonases have been implicated in the reduction of cell-to-cell adhesion and the remodeling of cell walls, contributing to developmental processes such as pollen development, organ abscission, and fruit ripening [4,9,84]. For instance, loss-of-function mutations in the Arabidopsis GH28 family member At3g07970 - also known as QUARTET2 (QRT2) - result in the production of tetrad pollen, caused by the failure of the four microspores to separate following meiosis [84,85]. QRT2 and the related genes ARABIDOPSIS DEHISCENCE ZONE POLYGALACTURONASE1 and 2 (ADPG1 and ADPG2) are all involved in anther dehiscence, a cell-separation process which allows for pollen release [84]. QRT2 and ADPG2 (At2g41850) both contribute to floral-organ shedding [84,86]; ADPG1 (At3g57510) and ADPG2 together promote the dehiscence of seed pods [84]. In vitro biochemical assays have confirmed the polygalacturonase activity of ADPG1, ADPG2, and the protein encoded by another GH28 family member, At1g48100 [84]. Twenty years ago, in tomato, it was shown that suppressing the expression of an endogenous polygalacturonase with antisense RNA inhibited the degradation of pectin during fruit ripening [87,88]. Since then, the importance of polygalacturonase activity in the ripening of many other fruits has also been demonstrated [9].Both tandem and whole-genome duplications have contributed to the presence of a relatively large number of GH28 genes in Arabidopsis compared to rice [22,25]. The type I cell walls of dicots contain much higher levels of pectin than the type II walls of grasses [89], and it has been proposed that the increased number of GH28s in Arabidopsis reflects a greater need for pectin-active enzymes [22]. Consistent with this hypothesis, maize (Zea mays) was recently reported to have 16 fewer GH28 genes than Arabidopsis [90], even though the maize genome is an order of magnitude larger and contains ~19% more protein-coding genes [91,92]. Our identification of 41 GH28 family members in Brachypodium and 38 in sorghum reinforces the conclusion that grasses have smaller numbers of polygalacturonase genes (Figure ​(Figure11 and additional file 8). Although small compared to Arabidopsis, the GH28 family in each of the grasses still consists of a substantial number of genes, possibly reflecting enzymatic functions associated with the pectin-rich middle lamella and the role of pectin during cell division.To investigate the evolutionary history of the GH28 family, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on protein sequences from Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium, sorghum, poplar, and maize (Figure ​(Figure66 and additional file 14). The maize sequences were as identified by Penning et al. [90], except that the proteins encoded by {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AC210013.4"",""term_id"":""211905086"",""term_text"":""AC210013.4""}}AC210013.4 and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AC231180.2"",""term_id"":""211905078"",""term_text"":""AC231180.2""}}AC231180.2 were omitted from the analysis, because they did not contain Pfam-predicted GH domains. For ease of reference, groups of GH28 proteins are labeled with the designations used by Penning et al. for Arabidopsis, rice, and maize [90]. These labels are included here to simplify comparisons across studies and do not necessarily correlate precisely with the clades of the six-species tree shown in Figure ​Figure6.6. For instance, while Group A has 100% bootstrap support, Group E as identified by Penning et al. [90] is split into two clades in our phylogenetic tree and is more appropriately regarded as part of the larger E/F/H clade (Figure ​(Figure66 and additional file 14). The proteins encoded by QRT2, ADPG1 and ADPG2 fall into group D and the At1g48100-encoded protein into group C (Figure ​(Figure66).The GH28 family of polygalacturonases. The tree includes GH28 proteins from Arabidopsis (AT), rice, Brachypodium (Bradi), sorghum, poplar, and maize. Tree construction and color-coding (blue for eudicots and red for grasses) are as in Figure 2. For several branches, the percent of bootstrap replicates supporting the branch is indicated. Dotted and solid gray lines mark groups according to the designations of Penning et al. [90]. Small gray arrows indicate proteins corresponding to genes - QRT2, ADPG1 and ADPG2 in group D and At1g48100 in group C - characterized by Ogawa et al. [84]. A gray asterisk marks a clade of grass sequences that does not fall into any of the other groups. For clarity, names are shown only for selected Arabidopsis and Brachypodium genes. For complete branch labels and bootstrap values, see additional file 14.As has been noted previously [90], the increased number of GH28 genes in Arabidopsis appears to be due to expansion within groups, rather than the creation of entirely novel, eudicot-specific groups (Figure ​(Figure6).6). For example, Group G and the less-cohesive Group E contain noticeably more Arabidopsis than Brachypodium members. There are, nevertheless, eudicot- and grass-specific clades; these include the eudicot-specific Group F and the grass-specific Group H recognized by Penning et al. [90] (Figure ​(Figure6).6). In our analysis, Groups F and H have strong bootstrap support, 99 and 100%, respectively. These two groups also form part of a larger Group E/F/H, which is supported by 96% of 1,000 bootstrap replicates (Figure ​(Figure66 and additional file 14).A tree constructed from Arabidopsis, rice, and maize sequences had indicated that Group B is ""Arabidopsis only"" [90]. In our larger tree with additional sequences from Brachypodium, sorghum, and poplar, Group B was loosely clustered (50% bootstrap support) and contained one GH28 each from Brachypodium and sorghum (Figure ​(Figure66 and additional file 14). Additionally, a tBLASTn search with the Brachypodium Group B member, Bradi5g18370, identified a wheat cDNA [GenBank: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AK330487.1"",""term_id"":""241990145"",""term_text"":""AK330487.1""}}AK330487.1, E-value = 2-119] predicted to encode a protein with a GH28 domain. The presence of Brachypodium and sorghum sequences in Group B and the identification of a related wheat sequence suggest that monocots are under-represented in, rather than absent from, the GH28 Group B.A further distinction between the three-species GH28 tree of Penning et al. [90] and the six-species tree presented here is the presence - in the larger tree - of a small, but very-well-supported, grass-specific clade comprised of two Brachypodium, one rice, and one sorghum sequence (indicated with an asterisk in Figure ​Figure6).6). Both of the Brachypodium genes, Bradi2g04520 and Bradi2g04550, have EST and Illumina transcriptome data supporting their expression. When the four grass sequences in this clade were used as queries in tBLASTn searches of GenBank, matches from five additional species (grape, castor bean, oilseed rape, avacado, and white spruce) were retrieved. However, none of these additional sequences fell into the same clade as the query sequences; this result is consistent with the apparent absence of the clade from species outside the Poaceae. As more genomes are sequenced and analyzed, it will be interesting to determine how widely distributed this clade actually is and whether it has a specialized function.The GH51 family includes α-L-arabinofuranosidases, which cleave terminal, non-reducing α-L-arabinofuranose residues from arabinose-containing compounds [1]. The pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I, found in dicot primary cell walls, and glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the predominant hemicellulose in grass primary cell walls, both contain terminal arabinose residues in their side chains [82,83,89]. Correspondingly, GH51 family members are implicated in plant-cell-wall remodeling [4]. The barley GH51 protein AXAH-I, for example, released arabinose from sugar beet arabinan, wheat arabinoxylan, and larch wood arabinogalactan [93]. In contrast to barley AXAH-I, some GH51 members are bi-functional enzymes, exhibiting both α-L-arabinofuranosidase and β-D-xylosidase activities. Arabidopsis ARAF1, for instance, exhibits a preference for arabinose-containing substrates but can release both L-arabinose and D-xylose from wheat and rye arabinoxylan [94].Arabinosidases have received particular attention for their contributions to pectin degradation during fruit ripening: while GH28 polygalacturonases cleave the pectin backbone, arabinosidases degrade pectin side chains [9]. During strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruit development, α-L-arabinofuranosidase activity is prominent; in a comparison of two strawberry cultivars, the softer fruit of one cultivar also had higher α-L-arabinofuranosidase specific activity and higher transcript levels for three arabinofuranosidase genes, FraAra1, 2, and 3 [95]. Expression of GH51 family members is not, however, limited to fruits. The peach ARF1 gene, although initially identified based on its activity in fruit, is also expressed in leaves and roots [96].Arabidopsis ARAF1 (At3g10740 or ASD1) is similarly broadly expressed, with ARAF1 transcripts detectable in roots, rosettes, stems, flowers, and siliques [97]. Analyses of plants transformed with an ARAF1-promoter-driven reporter indicated that ARAF1 is specifically expressed in tissues such as emerging lateral roots; the primary and developing secondary xylem of mature roots; the vasculature of cotyledons and leaves; and the phloem, cambium, and guard cells of the stem [97,98]. ARAF1 enzymatic activity is higher in young, growing stems than in mature stems, consistent with a possible cell-wall-remodeling function for ARAF1 [94]. Inmmunolocalization assays with the LM6 antibody, which binds arabinan epitopes, revealed localized increases in signal intensity in mutant araf1 stem and root tissues compared to the wild-type [98]. Conversely, wild-type stem sections exhibited markedly reduced signal intensity upon treatment with partially purified ARAF1 [98]. Together, these results suggest that ARAF1 acts on endogenous arabinose-containing polysaccharides in these tissues [98].In contrast to the large GH28 family, which is over-represented in eudicots, the smaller GH51 family is over-represented in grasses. Whereas Arabidopsis has two GH51 family members and poplar three, each of the grasses examined has approximately double this number: Rice has eight GH51 genes, Brachypodium five, and sorghum six (Figure ​(Figure11 and additional file 8). A phylogenetic tree constructed from Arabidopsis, poplar, rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum GH51 proteins, as well as additional eudicot and grass GH51 sequences retrieved from the CAZy database and GenBank, is shown in Figure ​Figure77 and additional file 15. The grass sequences form two clades, both distinct from the single eudicot clade. This well-supported family structure (≥98% bootstrap values for the three major clades) suggests that there has been duplication and diversification within the grass lineage. The clear separation between eudicot and grass sequences likely reflects the differing architectures of eudicot and grass cell walls, underscoring the need for a grass model. The similarity between Brachypodium and other grasses with regard to the cell-wall-related GH5, GH28, and GH51 families illustrates that Brachypodium can meet this need.The GH51 family of arabinofuranosidases. The tree includes GH51 proteins from the following plants: Arabidopsis (AT), rice (Os), Brachypodium (Bradi), sorghum (Sb), and poplar (Poptr), as well as sequences from 10 other eudicots and 4 other grasses (labeled with a genus-plus-species abbreviation and the GenBank accession number).

This tree is displayed in a rectangular format, with additional bootstrap values, in additional file 15.The GH13 family is well-known as the α-amylase family [99]. It encompasses most of the starch-modifying enzymes with a wide range of substrate specificities and catalytic activities, such as α-amylases, pullulanases, isoamylases, cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferases (CGTases), and branching enzymes [99,100]. Starch is the main component of cereal seeds and provides up to 80% of the calories consumed by humans. In addition, ethanol produced from starch is used as a transportation fuel [101]. Based on an analysis of catalytic domains, the GH13 family has been divided into 35 subfamilies, most of which represent a single catalytic activity; in those subfamilies with more than one catalytic activity, the activities are closely related [100]. Crystal structures have been reported for many GH13 family proteins. They have three conserved domains: domain A is the N-terminal, catalytic, (β/α)8 -barrel domain; domain B is a loop inserted in domain A; and domain C is a C-terminal, β-sandwich domain [99,102,103].We identified 13 GH13 genes from Brachypodium, 19 from sorghum and 13 from poplar (additional files 3, 6, and 9). There are 10 and 18 members in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively [2]. A phylogenetic tree based on protein sequences was constructed to investigate the evolutionary history of the GH13 family (Figure ​(Figure88 and additional file 16). A typical feature of this tree is that most of the branches have representatives from all species, suggesting broad conservation of the GH13 family in plants. The tree consists of three clades that are correlated with enzymatic activities: α-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1), branching enzymes (EC 2.4.1.18), and debranching enzymes including pullulanases (EC 3.2.1.41) and isoamylases (EC 3.2.1.68). All of the major branches of the tree are well-supported by bootstrap analysis (Figure ​(Figure88 and additional file 16).The GH13 family of α-amylases, pullulanases, isoamylases, and branching enzymes. The tree includes GH13 proteins from Arabidopsis (AT), rice (Os), Brachypodium (Bradi), sorghum (Sb), and poplar (Poptr). Tree construction and color-coding (blue for eudicots and red for grasses) are as in Figure 2. The three major clades are marked with dotted, gray lines and labeled with enzymatic activities. For complete bootstrap values, see additional file 16.α-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1) are the best-studied of the GH13 enzymes, due to their wide industrial use. α-amylases catalyze the hydrolysis of internal α-D-(1,4)-glucosidic linkages in starch (amylose and amylopectin), glycogen, and related oligo- and polysaccharides, releasing maltodextrins, maltooligosaccharides and glucose [102]. There are three α-amylase genes (AtAmy1-3) in Arabidopsis, and they represented three groups in previous phylogenetic analyses of α-amylase proteins from multiple species [104,105]. The AtAmy1 (At4g25000) protein contains a signal sequence and was predicted to enter the secretory pathway, AtAmy3 (At1g69830) was identified as plastid-targeted, and AtAmy2 (At1g76130) does not appear to be targeted to any particular compartment of the cell [104]. Each enzyme is believed to have a different role in plants, given the putative subcellular localizations [105]. In our phylogenetic tree (Figure ​(Figure8),8), the α-amylase clade is divided into two groups. One group containing AtAmy1 (At4g25000) includes a relatively large number of grass sequences. It has only 1 Arabidopsis and 3 poplar members, but 3 Brachypodium, 8 rice, and 9 sorghum members. Most of the additional rice and sorghum sequences are in clusters within the genome, indicating that the gene expansion was due to recent, local duplication, which is common for plant glycosidase- and glycosyltransferase-related genes [3]. The other group clusters AtAmy2 and AtAmy3 together with representatives from other species into two separate subgroups. Based on predictions of the TargetP program [106] (data not shown), these α-amylase genes, except two sorghum genes (Sb02g026625 and Sb03g032830) and two poplar genes (Poptr259394 and Poptr231366), encode proteins with the same subcellular location as the Arabidopsis member in the same group or subgroup.Branching enzymes catalyze the formation of branch points by cleaving the α-1,4 linkage in polyglucans and reattaching the chain via an α-1,6-glucan linkage; conversely, debranching enzymes directly hydrolyze the α-1,6-glucosic linkages of polyglucans [107]. They are involved in starch biosynthesis in the cereal endosperm [107] and affect the eating and cooking quality of rice [108]. In the phylogenetic tree (Figure ​(Figure88 and additional file 16), the branching and debranching enzymes form two clades. Each member is well-conserved between different species, except that poplar lacks one isoamylase and Arabidopsis lacks one branching enzyme representative (Figure ​(Figure8).8). The presence of both grass and eudicot sequences in each of the major clades and most of the subclades of the GH13 family likely reflects the key roles of starch-modifying enzymes in plants.A decade ago, phylogenetic trees for plant GHs primarily showed that a handful of plant enzymes were more closely related to each other than to their bacterial counterparts. Since then, genome sequencing efforts have uncovered many more plant GH genes, whose cataloging can build the foundation for detailed functional studies. Now, with the availability of genome-wide analyses of GHs in Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, Brachypodium, and sorghum, it is possible to examine evolutionary histories and hypothesize about orthologous relationships within plant GH families. Our analysis showed that, while all angiosperms likely possess members of the same 34 GH families, there are significant differences between monocots and eudicots in the relationships within these families. These differences probably arose in part because of the compositional differences between grass and eudicot cell walls. However, by including additional species in our comparisons, we determined that several clades of GHs previously thought to contain only monocot or dicot proteins do, in fact, contain GHs from both eudicots and monocots. This highlights the importance of examining several species before making broad generalizations.By defining the complement of Brachypodium GH genes, we set the stage for Brachypodium to be used as a grass model for investigations of the GHs and their diverse, associated functions. As with the eudicot model Arabidopsis, forward and reverse genetics combined with the phenotypic characterizations possible in a small, rapidly growing plant will help elucidate the in planta roles of GHs. Insights gained from Brachypodium will inform translational research studies, with applications for the improvement of cereal crops and bioenergy grasses.CAZy: Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes; CBM: carbohydrate-binding module; CRD: cysteine-rich chitin-binding domain; CTE: carboxy-terminal extension; EST: expressed sequence tag; GH: glycoside hydrolase; NCBI: National Center for Biotechnology Information; PR: pathogenesis-related; XIP: xylanase inhibitor proteinLT coordinated the overall analysis; compiled the overviews for the Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, Brachypodium, and sorghums GHs; retrieved poplar GH sequences; analyzed 90 GH families; performed phylogenetic analyses of the GH5, 28, and 51 families; wrote the accompanying text and edited the manuscript.

PMC3096672,"Phylogenetic Distribution of Intron Positions in Alpha-Amylase Genes
of Bilateria Suggests Numerous Gains and Losses",False,"Most eukaryotes have at least some genes interrupted by introns. While it is well
accepted that introns were already present at moderate density in the last
eukaryote common ancestor, the conspicuous diversity of intron density among
genomes suggests a complex evolutionary history, with marked differences between
phyla. The question of the rates of intron gains and loss in the course of
evolution and factors influencing them remains controversial. We have
investigated a single gene family, alpha-amylase, in 55 species covering a
variety of animal phyla. Comparison of intron positions across phyla suggests a
complex history, with a likely ancestral intronless gene undergoing frequent
intron loss and gain, leading to extant intron/exon structures that are highly
variable, even among species from the same phylum. Because introns are known to
play no regulatory role in this gene and there is no alternative splicing, the
structural differences may be interpreted more easily: intron positions, sizes,
losses or gains may be more likely related to factors linked to splicing
mechanisms and requirements, and to recognition of introns and exons, or to more
extrinsic factors, such as life cycle and population size. We have shown that
intron losses outnumbered gains in recent periods, but that “resets”
of intron positions occurred at the origin of several phyla, including
vertebrates. Rates of gain and loss appear to be positively correlated. No phase
preference was found. We also found evidence for parallel gains and for intron
sliding. Presence of introns at given positions was correlated to a strong
protosplice consensus sequence AG/G, which was much weaker in the absence of
intron. In contrast, recent intron insertions were not associated with a
specific sequence. In animal Amy genes, population size and
generation time seem to have played only minor roles in shaping gene
structures.Over thirty years ago, the discovery that eukaryotic genes were split, interrupted by
non-coding DNA (e.g. [1], [2], [3]), caused a revolution in biology. The functional and
evolutionary consequences of this unexpected gene structure were immediately
foreseen by W. Gilbert in a famous and short article, in which he coined the terms
intron and exon [4]. Since that time, the existence of introns in nuclear
genes has been the source of a long-standing -and in some aspects, still lasting-
debate. That debate concerns whether introns were present at the very beginning of
life (the so-called “intron-early theory”), or were inserted much later
in previously uninterrupted coding sequences (intron-late). Predictions of both
theories have been tested using increasingly available data, although with sometimes
opposite results. For instance, predictions of the intron-early theory regarding
intron phase distribution (an excess of phase 0 introns) were confirmed for ancient
genes, but contradictory interpretations were given by different authors, according
to the analytical models they used [5], [6], [7]. For intron-late supporters, the age of the first introns
was previously thought to be rather recent, given the initial lack of known introns
in mitochondria-lacking eukaryotes (named Archezoa [8]). Much progress in the
debate has been brought by the general effort of genome sequencing of a number of
eukaryotes and prokaryotes, which has shown that (1) all sequenced prokaryotes lack
spliceosomal introns and the elements of the splicing machinery, and (2) nearly all
eukaryotes sequenced to date have at least a few spliceosomal introns, and all have
elements of the spliceosome [9]. This demonstrates, according to many authors, that
introns have been inserted in eukaryotes, at a very early stage of their evolution,
so that all extant eukaryotes stem from an intron-bearing, and potentially
intron-rich ancestor [10], [11], [12]. Potentially intron spread was tightly linked to the
still mysterious origin of eukaryotes (e.g ref. [13]), maybe concomitant to it, and
introns may have been a powerful booster of evolutionary novelties through
exon-shuffling, alternative splicing, surveillance of mRNA integrity, promoting and
favoring recombination [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Indeed, as Lynch and Richardson said [16], “it is
likely that few, if any, of today's eukaryotes could survive without
introns”.The focus of the debate have shifted today to understanding intron gains and losses
in the course of the history of eukaryotes, and estimating intron density in the
genome of the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Are intron losses more frequent than
intron gains, and if so, how long has this been the case? Or, in contrast, have
gains been a high-frequency phenomenon at some time in the past, and thereafter have
decreased to become rare events at more recent periods? Are rates of gains and
losses correlated? Are rates of gains and losses lineage dependent? Genome data
increasingly show significant levels of corresponding intron positions in conserved
orthologous genes between remote eukaryotes, such as plants and animals [10], [19], [20], [21]. The extent to
which these coincidental positions reflect true orthologous introns (i.e. present in
the common ancestor) or parallel gains has been estimated by several workers, but
remains controversial (reviewed in [22]).A particular point that remains to be clarified is the gene-dependence of intron
dynamics. Many authors have emphasized the importance of introns in the functions of
a number of genes, for example because of the presence of regulatory information
within introns (e.g. [23]), or because of the size of introns, which would simply
act as timers for the proper temporal expression in the embryo development [24], or because of
their role in mRNA surveillance through the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) process
[17]. If
introns differ significantly in their functional roles, then genomic studies of
introns will tend to pool introns upon which selective forces act differently, and
differences in functional fitness consequences of intron dynamics (i.e. gain or
loss) will be overlooked.Investigating intron dynamics in a single gene (or gene family) in various species
may be valuable in this respect [25]. We compared intron-exon
structures in alpha-amylase genes of animals, to illustrate the diversity of intron
dynamics in genes with identical function in various organisms. Alpha-amylases form
a multigene family in most organisms, including animals [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], but all copies have virtually
the same function of degrading starch and related polysaccharides (http://www.cazy.org
[31]). The amino
acid sequence is poorly conserved among kingdoms [32], so that comparisons of
intron-exon structures with plants or fungi are unreliable. Although it is possible
to perform structural alignments owing to the conservation of the three-dimensional
structure, such alignments remain ambiguous and limited to small parts of the
sequence. Since studying intron gains and losses, through the conservation of intron
positions, requires unambiguous alignments, we restricted our investigation to
animal-type amylases in Bilateria, which align well to each others. No animal-type
amylase (subfamily GH13_15/24 [33]) was found to date in non-bilaterian Metazoa, i.e.
Porifera and Cnidaria [34] and Placozoa (unpublished). Instead, Fungus-type (GH13_1)
alpha-amylase, also called Dictyostelium-type, seems to be the
common and ancestral type in Unikonts, excluding Bilateria. Regarding the focus of
the present work, it is interesting to note that the animal-type alpha-amylase
studied here may be considered a “recent” gene, because it is assumed to
be of bacterial origin through horizontal transfer [34]. Thus, the ancestral structure
should have been intronless. As detailed below, the intron-exon structures are
highly diverse among animal species, even, for example, within insects. Importantly,
neither alternative splicing nor regulatory information within Amy
introns have been reported to date in amylases. Thus, amylase genes will be
considered free of this kind of constraints, so that the observed structural
differences may be interpreted more easily: intron positions, sizes, losses or gains
may be more likely related to factors linked to splicing mechanisms and
requirements, and recognition of introns and exons, or to more extrinsic factors,
such as life cycle and population size. Repeated intron losses in amylase genes have
been reported in Drosophila and other Diptera [35], [36]. This study extends the
investigation to the Bilateria.The animal species used in this study are listed in Table 1. To our knowledge, amylase genes are
absent in the following bilaterian species whose genome has been deciphered: the
louse Pediculus humanus, the flatworms Schmidtea
mediterranea and Schistosoma mansoni, the leech
Helobdella robusta, the aphid Acyrtosiphon
pisum. Alpha-amylase genes were either determined experimentally or
obtained from databases. In the latter case, the genome data, generally as draft
releases, were searched with TBLASTN or BLASTP [37] using an animal sequence
as a query. Given the similarity among animal amylases, we found that any animal
Amy sequence could be used. For raw traces archives data,
the best BLAST hits were assembled manually, with attention to the fact that
several gene copies may occur. For experimental work, DNAs were extracted with
classical methods. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were performed
using combinations of a set of primers spanning a large part of the coding
sequence, listed in Table S1. Amplification reactions were
performed with increased elongation time to allow correct elongation, even in
the presence of a further 1–2 kb of intronic DNA, in addition to the
expected spliced length. For Asterias rubens (DNA supplied by
A. van Wormhoudt, Station Marine de Concarneau), a partially amplified
Amy gene was used as a probe for screening a mini-library

Apis mellifera (for the latter, a genomic library was
kindly screened by M. Solignac in our laboratory). A genome walking strategy
(Universal Genome Walking kit, Clontech) was applied to Bibio
marci, Musca domestica, Spodoptera
frugiperda (DNA from Sf9 cells), Blaps mucronata,
Periplaneta americana, Dysdera crocata,
Lithobius forficatus, Corbicula fluminea,
Cerastoderma edule, Mytilus edulis,
Patella vulgata.Putative introns were identified by translating the DNA sequences in the three
frames and comparing the results with a manual alignment of known amylase
proteins. Discrepancies and premature stops indicated the presence of introns,
the boundaries of which were marked by finding donor and acceptor sites, which
led to an in frame coding sequence. There were a few ambiguous cases in variable
regions of the protein, where the alignment was uncertain. When possible, EST
databases were used to check the predicted intron positions. Searches for
remnants of transposable elements or duplicated neighboring exons within introns
were performed using BLASTX (the introns of a single gene against Genbank, and
against the coding sequence of the same gene, respectively). Intron losses or
gains were inferred by parsimony, taking into account the phylogenetic
relationships between the species harboring an intron at a given position.
Introns were numbered, choosing intron 1 as the most widespread, conserved
position among Bilateria.We obtained 79 genomic sequences of partial or complete amylase genes from 55
Bilaterian taxa. The extent of sequence available for each gene is shown on
Figure 1. Seventy-four
intron positions were found. We did not consider introns which may be found in
the extra C-terminal domain present in some species (JLDL, unpublished). All the
positions were mapped onto the pig pancreatic amylase protein sequence (Fig. 2). Figure S1
shows the mapping of intron positions onto a protein alignment, showing the
conservation of the amylase sequence at each inferred position. Figure 1 shows the high
diversity of intron-exon structures of Amy genes among animals:
from no intron in Drosophila melanogaster to 14 introns in one
gene of Daphnia pulex. In some documented cases, there is also
a variation between gene copies of a single species: in D.
pulex, we studied three copies, Amy1,
Amy2 and Amy3, with a total of 25
positions, 21 of which were specific of one of the three copies. In the Annelide
Capitella teleta, three copies harbored a total of 7 intron
positions, four of which were copy-specific. In the amphioxus
Branchiostoma floridae, there were a total of 14 positions,
among which 5 were found only in the AmyC copy. In contrast, in
vertebrates, all the intron positions were shared by all gene copies within a
species. It was for example the case in Xenopus tropicalis,
Tetraodon nigroviridis, and human (not shown).Sequence length available for each gene was shaded in grey. Introns were
numbered according to their position, with intron 1 being the most
widespread. When structures of tandem duplicated genes were similar
(e.g. Tetraodon nigroviridis), only one was retained
for the figure. Pink circles: phase zero introns; green circles: phase
one introns; blue circles: phase two introns. The black circle in
B. floridae AmyB indicates a dubious position,
which was excluded from the study.Pink lines: phase zero introns; green lines: phase one introns; blue
lines: phase two introns. The signal peptide is shaded. Secondary
structures of the (β/α)8 barrel in the domain A of
the protein are indicated as orange (β strands) or red (α
helices). *: position −6 cannot be placed with accuracy, due
to the high variability of the signal sequence (see text).The diversity of intron/exon structures is highest among arthropods, with
D. pulex and D. melanogaster being
representative of the two extremes. The Lepidoptera seem to have many introns in
their Amy genes, whereas Diptera have fewer. The case of
Diptera Amy genes has been detailed in [36]. This high diversity
may be not specific to arthropods, but our sample is biased; arthropods,
especially insects, are largely represented here. More comprehensive data from
other phyla might give similar results. For example, the tunicate Ciona
intestinalis has numerous introns but not
Oïkopleura, a distant Urochordate with a compact
genome [38]. On
the contrary, all vertebrates have many introns in their Amy
genes, but to our knowledge, there is almost no variation in number: 8 in
teleost fishes and 9 in other vertebrates.As mentioned above, in some species, the same intron/exon structure is shared by
the whole Amy gene family, whereas other species show striking
differences between copies. The copies that share the same structure are
generally physically close to each others, like in vertebrates. In the
amphioxus, AmyC, which has several specific introns, is
isolated, whereas the clustered AmyA and AmyB
share most of their intron positions. Divergence in structure is correlated with
divergence in sequence: AmyA and AmyB share
78% identity with each other at the protein level, but with
AmyC, only 64% (A/C) or 55% (B/C). In the
flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, four Amy
copies are tandemly arranged, all of which have the same gene structure
according to the genome annotation. Interestingly, in a previous cloning of two
tandem copies [GenBank: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""U04271"",""term_id"":""436948"",""term_text"":""U04271""}}U04271], both copies had been found to lack
intron 5. In the whole genome sequenced, the four copies have this intron. This
suggests a polymorphic presence/absence of this intron in T.
castaneum, which has been rarely reported [39], [40], [41]. Another example is the
wasp Nasonia vitripennis: two tandem copies
Amy2 and Amy3, very close to each other,
share the same structure, whereas a third copy Amy1, found on a
different contig, has a different structure. Thus, the conservation of
intron/exon structure between gene copies, like the coding sequence, may be
linked to their physical vicinity, as expected if the duplication events are
more recent than with more distant copies. Additionally, there may be some
concerted evolution (likely gene conversion was observed between
Amy1 and Amy1' of Daphnia
pulex). However, although the intron positions are similar in
tandem copies, it is also frequent that the sizes and sequences of homologous
introns are very different (e.g. Amphioxus, Xenopus, Tetraodon). In the
centipede Lithobius forficatus, there are two close tandem
Amy copies. Intron 1 sequences (data not available for
other introns in Amy2) are of different sizes (1417 bp vs. 1130
bp) and share no similarity at all. In the tandem Amy genes of
Nasonia vitripennis, the coding sequences are 90%
identical, whereas there is no similarity in introns, except the most distal
(3′) intron 63, which is highly conserved.
Figure 1 shows the intron
positions for each of the sequences studied. It is immediately clear that only a
few positions are widely shared among the sample: introns 1 and 11 are shared by
various Protostomes and Deuterostomes; intron 5 may be also considered as widely
shared if it is related to the vertebrate-specific intron 4 through intron
sliding. All other intron positions are more restricted, but some are shared by
several species of a single taxonomic entity. Two positions may be considered
Protostome-specific (15 and 33); positions 17, 21, 37, 57, and 63 are specific
to Arthropods. In addition, position 42 is insect-specific; position 12 is
Coleoptera-specific; position 24 is Diptera-specific; position 46 is
Lepidoptera-specific (moths only are represented). According to our data,
mollusks-specific positions are scarce: position 62, which is also shared by the
Annelide Capitella, and position −6, which is the only
intron found in the region encoding the signal peptide. Owing to low sequence
conservation of this region, orthology of this position among species is not
sure (see Fig. 2). In
Deuterostomes, only position 13 may be considered Deuterostome-specific, i.e.
shared by several phyla. Six out of nine vertebrate intron positions are
vertebrate-specific: introns 4 (assuming this does not represent an intron
sliding event), 30, 35, 41, 50 and 55. Echinodermata are represented by a sea
urchin, a sea star and an ophiura, which share positions −4 and 6. The
Hemichordate S. kowalevskii shares with them position −4,
and potentially its specific position 6b which could be misplaced due to
ambiguous alignment. Hemichordates are the likely sister group of Echinodermata
[42].Clearly, these conclusions rely on the sampling, and could be changed with
increasing data set. For instance, a number of positions are specific to
Caenorhabditis, but other nematode species would be
necessary to clarify the phylogenetic spread of these positions within
Nematodes. More intron positions are bound to be found within most of the phyla
represented here in the future. However, the collected data already allow to
analyse some aspects of intron dynamics in Amy genes.All Amy introns found so far are of the usual GT-AG type. Of the
74 intron positions, 25 are in phase zero (between two codons), 27 are in phase
one (between the first et second base of a codon) and 22 are in phase two
(between the second and third base of a codon). This distribution is not
significantly different from a 1∶1∶1 proportion
(χ2 = 0.513, ns), and is different from the
usual bias observed toward phase 0 introns [6], [7]. We divided the sequence (Fig. 2) in five equal parts of
102 amino acids. The global intron distribution among these parts is not
significantly uneven (χ2 = 5.09, ns).
Intron-rich genes show a spread of the introns along the whole sequence. In
contrast there is no clear trend for intron-poor genes (one or two introns) to
have their introns located at the beginning of the sequence. However in some
cases the pattern of distribution does appear unusual: in a number of Molluscan
and Annelide sequences, most introns are concentrated in the 5′ part of
the gene, with the exception of a single 3′ one.We also studied intron insertion sites. Exonic nucleotides flanking intron
positions are not random: with observed preference for a consensus
AG/(intron)/GT [43], the so-called “protosplice site”. To
what extent this represents biases in the sites of intron creation, versus
post-insertional selection, for instance for splicing efficiency, remains
debated. For each intron position, we compared flanking exonic sequences across
genes which did and did not contain an intron – “occupied”
sites and “empty” sites (introns lost or never inserted) (Fig. 3 and Table S2).
Occupied sites showed a stronger protosplice consensus, except for phase 1
introns, for which a G/G minimal consensus was common to occupied and empty
sites, perhaps because they were inside conserved glycine codons. For phase 0
introns, the classical protosplice consensus AG/GT was found when introns were
present. This sequence was also particularly clear for the three presumably
oldest sites, i.e. positions 1, 5, 11, for which an absence of intron, supposed
to be unambiguously due to a loss, was related to a weaker consensus (Fig. 3E). This suggests a
relaxation of constraints after intron loss at these positions. We also checked
for a few “recently gained” intron positions (25a, 27, 29, 53b
pooled) whether the surrounding sequence showed a consensus motif. There was no
consensus when the intron was absent, assumed to be the ancestral state (232
occurrences, not shown), nor in the four cases of insertion (Table S2).
In these few cases, insertion was not linked to the presence of a preferential
sequence. These results are consistent with the notion that the positions of the
de novo intron insertions are largely unbiased, and that
selection drives the emergence of protosplice-like sequences following intron
insertion [44]; in addition, the finding that protosplice sites are
observed for very old introns but not for much younger ones, may suggest that
the transition to protosplice sites is a slow process.Positions −2, −1, +1 and +2 relative to the introns
are shown. Intron positions in badly alignable regions were not used.
Data are from Table S2. n: number
of positions used; occupied: sites currently with an
intron; empty: homologous sites devoid of intron. A:
all intron positions; B: phase 0 positions; C: phase 1 positions; D:
phase 2 positions; E: old positions, considered as ancestrally filled
with an intron (pos. 1, 5, 11). Diagrams were made with Weblogo
(http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/).Investigating the rates or frequencies of intron losses and gains in
Amy genes is the main goal of this study. Relating the
presence/absence factual data to the loss/gain interpretation is mainly a matter
of sampling. From our data set, we have been able to identify numerous intron
losses at various periods in the past, ancient losses basal to a whole phylum,
or more recent, phylogenetically more limited losses. For example, Figure 1 shows that intron 1,
the most common one, is certainly ancestral in Bilateria, and has been lost
several times, in some dipteran genes, in Echinoderms, in the tunicate
Oïkopleura and in Caenorhabditis. We
focused on Drosophila Amy genes more thoroughly by PCR and we
confirmed that intron 1 was lost independently in several lineages within the
last 30 million years, but only in the subgenus Sophophora, in
which the number of gene copies is more than one (excluding the old paralog
Amyrel), whereas no intron loss was recorded in the
subgenus Drosophila, in which Amy seems to be
generally single-copy. It is possible that increased intron losses could be
related to the number of gene copies. Intron position 11 is also considered
ancestral, but would have been lost, according to the data, in Mollusks, in
Echinoderms, and in Diptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. Intron 5 is also
widespread and old, since it is shared throughout Protostomes. It is also
present in the amphioxus, but since it is absent from other Deuterostomes, it is
not clear whether it is an ancestral position or represents a case of parallel
insertion, unless one considers intron 4 (vertebrates) as the result of a 5
bp-sliding from position 5, a hypothesis for which there is no evidence.The tree in Figure 4
summarizes the proposed status of lost or gained introns, according to their
phylogenetic distribution. Inferences of gains or losses on the tree reflect
parsimony reconstructions; other interpretations are plausible for a number of
positions (Table
S3) because the data suggest either massive losses or parallel gains,
which is a common issue in this kind of investigations. For instance, in Figure 4, introns 15 and 33,
which are Protostome-specific, have been considered each as cases of independent
gains. The Deuterostome-specific intron 13 was considered as two independent
gains rather than ancestral to Deuterostomes. As another example, position 20 is
shared by vertebrates and one gene of the worm Capitella. This
is more suggestive of parallel gains. Indeed, some of these uncertain cases
could be solved with an increased sample. Some cases are however clear: intron
35 has been lost in fishes since it is present in the lamprey P.
marinus and the tetrapods; intron 34 has been lost in C.
elegans, since it is present in C. briggsae,
C. brenneri, C. remanei and
Pristionchus pacificus (not shown). Other examples may be
found in Figure 1.Phylogenetic tree of the Bilateria species included in this study,
consensus drawn from refs. [42], [110],
[111], [112], [113],
[114], [115]. Intron
positions were placed at nodes corresponding to the putative losses (red
numbers) or gains (blue numbers), deduced from the phylogenetic
distribution of Fig.
1. Alternative possibilities are proposed on Table
S3. For clarity of the figure, the repeated losses in
Protostomes of the positions shared with Amphioxus (question mark) were
not reported. Color code for taxonomical groups is the same as in Fig. 1.Cases of gains are also likely, but most often less directly conclusive, and
there is no obvious case of “recent” gain. The seemingly high number
of gains on terminal branches of the tree (Fig. 4) does not mean that these gains are
truly recent. Intron gain cases were inferred when the phylogenetic distribution
of the intron was scarce or limited to a clade, given a correct sampling in
related taxa or phyla (see paragraph Widely conserved introns and
phylum-specific introns above). The assignment of intron losses and
gains is thus dependent on sampling. The extreme case is for introns limited to
one species or one gene in the data set. For instance, one can infer an intron
gain for position 25a in the Nematocere A. sarothamni because
the dipteran sampling is good; intron 53b may have been gained in the wasp
N. vitripennis, by comparison with other Hymenoptera
sequences. In Bivalves, the oyster and scallop sequences each show a specific
intron (27 and 40, respectively), which could be examples of species-specific
intron gains. However, this interpretation is weakened because we do not know
all Amy copies of each species. It is thus possible that these
introns are present in other copies of the other species. The most striking
example of possible gains is that of Daphnia pulex. This
species has the most split Amy gene (14 introns), and 14
species-specific positions, which can be considered gained. Indeed, many likely
paralog-specific gains are inferred. Considering Amy1 and
Amy2, which are related to each other, since they are
clustered in an animal Amy gene tree (not shown), there are
only two common positions (not shared with Amy3 nor any other
sequence), but six additional positions which are unique to
Amy1, reflecting either gains in Amy1 or
losses in Amy2. The structure of Amy3 is less
derived, sharing five introns with other Arthropods: 15, 21, 37, 52, 57, 63.
This suggests a complex structural history after gene duplications in this
lineage. However, though we are confident that these positions are gains, the
sampling for Branchiopoda is limited to this species, so that the exact
antiquity of these introns is unknown. They could also be shared by other,
unsampled Crustacean clades. Overall, we did not find conclusive cases of intron
gains more recent than 150–200 million years.In contrast, phylum-specific positions, corresponding to ancient gains stemming
from the origin of the phyla, perhaps during the Cambrian or late Precambrian
explosion, seem to be frequent. It is visually clear on Figure 1 for Deuterostomes, but also in
Protostomes. In contrast, there are few positions shared by several Protostome
phyla, or by several Deuterostome phyla. Regarding Deuterostomes, at most one
intron position is shared exclusively by them (and it may be a parallel gain).
Surprisingly, in the amphioxus, 7 of 13 positions are shared with Protostomes,
but not with other Deuterostomes (5, 31, 37, 48, 49, 54, 58).Intron sliding is suspected to have occurred when two intron positions are very
close to each other between two gene copies or two species. The phylogenetic
sample must be sufficient enough to rule out parallel insertions. In our study,
some positions are conspicuous: in D. pulex, positions −2
and −1, one base pair apart, harbored by two paralogs
Amy2 and Amy1, respectively, create each
with intron 1, a very small exon of 8 bp and 7 bp, respectively. This was
confirmed by ESTs (http://wfleabase.org/genomics/est/) and our experimental
resequencing of this gene region. Introns 8 (Amy3) and 9
(Amy2) are also one base pair apart. Rather than
independent gains in paralogous copies, both cases strongly suggest 1 bp intron
sliding, the most frequently encountered, according to some authors [20], [45]. However,
the intron sequences are very different, so that the ultimate evidence, intron
sequence similarity, is lacking. Other putative candidates for intron sliding
may be introns 44–45, or 46–47 (Fig. 2) but the phylogenetic distribution of
these positions is rather in favor of independent gains. The case of introns
4–5 was mentioned above, but cannot be solved with our data.The origin of animal amylases remains enigmatic. Up to now, animal-type
alpha-amylases (i.e. GH13_15/24 [33]) were found only in bilaterian metazoa. The age and the
origin of the ancestral bilaterian amylase are not well established (discussed in
ref. [34]). Recent
estimates suggest the origin of Bilateria to be rather close to the basal Cambrian
[46], [47], [48]. We have
proposed that Amy arose by horizontal transfer from a bacterium
after the split of Cnidaria [34]. This implies a massive and not so old colonization by
introns. Basu et al. [49] have shown that genes transferred to the nucleus from the
plastid precursor cyanobacterium were quickly colonized by introns. Nuclear genes of
mitochondrial origin were also shown to be colonized quickly [50]. But these events are
probably much older. Importantly, the bilaterian Amy genes cannot
be regarded as “ancient genes” such as those included in clusters of
orthologous genes (COG) and used in comparative genomic studies (e.g. [7], [10], [19], [21], [51], [52]).The simple observation of the variety of structures among the holometabolous insects
was an invitation to try reconstituting the history of intron movements, not only in
insect amylases, but also in other animals. Such data could help understanding more
general rules of intron dynamics. Focusing on this single gene, either as a
single-copy or, most often in animals, duplicated, we have identified dozens of
intron positions. It is clear that new positions will still be found by searching in
taxonomic groups not studied yet.An important result of this study is that few intron positions can be identified as
certainly ancestral, but it does not mean that the last bilaterian common ancestor
had only these relic introns. On the other hand, numerous positions may stem from
the origins of individual phyla or sub-phyla, in the late Proterozoic or during the
Cambrian, and be concomitant to the genome novelties that accompanied new bauplans
(what Babenko et al. [53] called “transitional periods of evolutionary
history”). The ancestral Amy structure would have been partly
reset in most phyla. After a burst of intron movements, especially gains, basal to
Bilateria, losses would have become predominant until now, at various rates. In
Amy genes, intron gains and losses seem to have occurred in a
temporally irregular manner. The uneven nature of these rates has been already
reported in comparative genomic studies [51], [53], [54]. This picture is akin to the
one depicted in genomic studies [22], [53] or in single gene studies [55], [56]. A majority of comparative
genomic studies have suggested excess of losses over gains over the last 500 MY (e.g
[49], [57], [58], [59], except in Fungi
[60].
However, increasing data suggest that intron acquisition is still ongoing (reviewed
in [61]). Case
studies have often shown frequent intron losses too, e.g. [35], [36], [39], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. But in some cases, where
the sample was phylogenetically large with known divergence dates, intron gains were
found to be dominant [68].At the genome level, vertebrates share many more intron positions than expected
with the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a non-bilaterian
animal [69]
and also with the polychaete annelid Platynereis dumerilii in a
genome fragment of 30 contiguous genes [70] (we did not confirm this in
the Polychaeta Capitella teleta). This suggests that
vertebrates could have conserved ancestral exon-intron structures, while most
other phyla would show derived patterns. However, this reasoning does not hold
regarding Amy since we posit that the bilaterian
Amy gene originated from bacteria, and then was devoid of
introns in the early Bilateria. Genome data indicate that 85% of intron
positions in the amphioxus B. floridae are shared with
vertebrates [71]. Thus it was unexpected to find that seven positions
out of 13 in the amphioxus Amy genes were shared with
Protostomes, and with Protostomes only, whereas few intron positions are shared
among Deuterostomes. This situation is intriguing. This suggests either repeated
parallel gains, or retention of ancestral positions. Parallel gains are
possible: other Deuterostomes share about one Amy intron
position with Protostomes. But seven parallel gains in this single species raise
questions. On the other hand, retention of ancestral positions implies that the
last ancestor between Protostomes and Deuterostomes had Amy
gene(s) with a Protostome-like structure, which, in Deuterostomes, was retained
solely in the amphioxus; but there is no clear pattern of conservation of the
amphioxus introns with those of a subset of Protostomes. Instead, these
coincident positions are scattered among various protostome species. Many losses
are needed for this scenario. Thus, there is still little evidence for this
hypothesis. A mixed model is also likely. In any hypothesis, the observed
pattern implies numerous intron losses and gains in vertebrates, urochordates,
echinoderms. In many genes of the urochordate Oïkopleura
dioica, introns have strikingly moved even after the split from
Ciona intestinalis, so that most of them are
species-specific [72], [73]. More generally, the numerous losses and gains basal
to most phyla, which are necessary to explain the observed patterns, suggest a
positive correlation between the rates of gain and loss.A good phylogenetic coverage is crucial for inferring true gains. In this
respect, our best data are for insects. Recent cases of losses and gains have
been documented in the genus Drosophila, showing that losses
were eight times as frequent as gains [74]. Accordingly,
we have identified several independent losses of the same intron in
Amy genes from various Drosophila species probably less
than 20 MY ago [35], [36], [75], [76]. Regarding gains, the most recent datable gains in
insect amylases are not younger than 200 MY, given the divergence times and
origin of the holometabolous orders [77]. The gain of intron 25a
in A. sarothamni may be younger, but it is not possible to date
it. Insect Amy genes have rather undergone mostly intron losses
(Fig. 4).In contradiction with Qiu et al. [7], who assume constant rates for a given gene across all
the phyla, intron dynamics in Amy genes has been quite
different among the studied lineages, e.g. arthropods vs.
vertebrates: in vertebrates, almost no intron movement occurred since the split
of lampreys and jawed vertebrates 500 MY ago [78]. We noticed only one loss
in teleost fishes. This low variability in intron positions is considered
typical of vertebrate genomes [79], [80], although recent works suggest that changes occurred
in some gene families [81]. During the same period of time, and even shorter
regarding insects, arthropods amylases evolved a wealth on intron-exon
structures. What is the origin of such a diversity? What are the intrinsic or
extrinsic factors involved in intron losses and gains and their fixation?The most frequently assumed mechanism of intron loss considers a cDNA
intermediate produced by endogenous reverse transcriptases [51], [74], [79], [82], [83]. The cDNA is
most often a truncated, 3′ part of the spliced gene. Thus, 3′ biased
losses are expected, and intron richness should be higher by the 5′ part
of the gene [51], [84]. Our data seem to be roughly in agreement with such a
mechanism, in that there are no widely shared introns in the 3′ half of
the Amy genes, suggesting that recurrent losses may have
restricted most 3′ introns to particular clades. However, “orphan
introns” (those found only in one species or in a restricted group) also
frequently exist in the 5′ part of the gene, and in several species, a
proximal, clearly old intron was lost (e.g. intron 1), but not other, more
distal ones. This shows that the mechanism may be more complex, or use more
5′ partial retrotranscripts, with internal priming. In our study, genomic
deletions seem not to be responsible for the observed losses, since all intron
losses are accurate, removing or adding no coding sequence, contrary to what
occurred for example in the jingwei gene of Drosophila
teissieri
[40] or in
pufferfishes [80].To be transmitted to the progeny, an intron loss or gain must occur in the
germline, as pointed out earlier [63], [67], [85]. In our context of a
retrotranscript intermediate, this implies that Amy genes
experiencing intron losses should be transcribed in the germline, at least at a
basal level. Differential levels of germline expression among species could
account for the differential variability of intron-exon structure. For example,
to explain the intron-rich structures of Amy genes, with little
variability in the Lepidoptera studied here, since their divergence from each
other over 75 MY ago (dates from fossil records [77]), as compared to Diptera,
we may hypothesize an absence of germline transcription. Unfortunately, there
are little data about Amy expression in the germline for the
species studied here, except for D. melanogaster, C.
elegans and mammals (GEO profiles: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=geo; flyatlas.org). Nonetheless, supporting this hypothesis, the
comparison between Amy and its paralog Amyrel
within flies shows that while the Amy intron (intron 1) was
lost several times, there was almost no case of loss in Amyrel
(intron 17) in more than 200 species studied, diverged from 0.5 to over 80 MY
[36],
[86]. The
Flyatlas data suggest indeed that in D. melanogaster,
Amy is transcribed in testis whereas
Amyrel is not (nor in ovaries).Another factor may influence the final intron-exon pattern and intron dynamics.
The efficiency of the splicing machinery to splice out introns is linked to its
ability to recognize and identify exons or introns properly. The exon definition
model [87]
suggests strong constraints on the size of exons in vertebrates, with a critical
upper size, beyond which an exon could be misrecognized and skipped. This
implies that intron losses (and also sliding, if mediated by a loss and gain
mechanism [88], [89]) would be often counterselected. This would explain
the low variability in intron-exon structure of vertebrate genes, including
Amy. This model might apply to other species with short
exons and long introns of our sample, such as Lepidoptera or the shrimp
L. vannamei. In some other species, in contrast, introns
are numerous but very short, e.g. in D. pulex, C.
elegans and C. briggsae. In these species, the
genome of which has been sequenced, short introns are a general feature
(wfleabase.org; [90]). This could be linked to mechanistic requirement for
proper intron recognition [91]. Some species harbor Amy genes with
both short and long introns, short and long exons, probably requiring mixed
splicing recognition mechanisms. Daphnia pulex deserves
particular mention for its 7 bp and 8 bp exons. Such small exons are rare in
animals [92],
[93],
[94], [95]. Their
correct splicing might require strenghtened splicing sites and splice enhancers
[56], or
else they could be skipped. The corresponding introns −2 and −1 are
bounded by GCG/GA and CGG/TG, respectively, which are not strong, canonical
protosplices, but unknown signals may lie inside the introns surrounding these
short exons.A correlation between the intron number or length and the level of expression of
amylase could be expected as an optimization to lower the cost of transcription
in highly expressed genes [96], [97]. But in many
Drosophila species, amylase is highly expressed, irrespective of intron presence
and size (no intron in some species, one intron longer than 1,2 kb in D.
phalerata). In mammals, nine long introns are present, yet amylase
is produced at a high level. In A. thaliana, Knowles et al.
[98] also
found no relationship between intron gain or loss and gene expression.Intron richness of organisms may be influenced by generation time and cell cycle
duration, as mentioned and discussed earlier [38], [54], [72], [99]. This view assumes that fast
reproducing animals would have less and/or shorter introns, as a genome
compaction. This has been examplified in the urochordate Oïkopleura
dioica, whose life cycle is four days long [72]. However, our data on
amylase genes seem not to show a clearcut discrimination such as long-cycle
animals with many introns vs. short-cycle animals with few
introns. For instance, C. elegans probably has dozens of
generations a year, and a six-intron Amy gene (although introns
are short). The same observation applies to the moth S.
frugiperda, which has about 12 generation per year in the wild, and
yet, its amylase gene has six long introns, increasing the gene size by
150%.The influence of population size on shaping gene structures has been proposed as
a major evolutionary force [16], [100], [101]. It is assumed that many introns, considered
slightly deleterious, could have been fixed by genetic drift in the putatively
small populations occurring at the early times of eukaryote evolution,
explaining that many unicellular eukaryotes, with large population sizes,
experienced intron losses driven by purifying selection, whereas multicellular
organisms with small population sizes retained their introns, and then remained
intron-rich. Such effects may be difficult to test in Metazoa, owing to the
order of magnitude of the differences in population sizes between species, which
is not as high as between unicellular and multicellular organisms. However, it
is likely that effective population sizes are comparable, for instance, between
moths and flies, which have very different Amy gene structures.
This suggests that demographic factors had little influence in our case.Several mechanisms of intron gains have been proposed. But since intron sequences
evolve rapidly, the origin and the insertion mechanism of an intron cannot be
identified, unless the intron gain is recent enough. Indeed, we never found the
origin of gained introns in our data. We found no case of introns created by
insertion of transposable elements, although a few introns contained transposon
fragments (Table
S5). However, retrotransposable elements may act through the
synthesis of reverse transcriptase (RT) by Pol genes. As for
intron loss, RT would produce partial cDNAs, which would be reinserted in the
genome. Internal duplications at the DNA level could also be a source of introns
if correct splicing sequences were present at the duplicate ends. We found
neither trace of such intronization of duplicated exons in the putatively most
recently gained introns nor evidence of intron gain through (recent) intron
transposition between two genes or within the same gene by reverse splicing. Our
ability to detect intron transposition may be scrambled (see [99], [102]) because
sequence similarity may be shared by different introns without any direct
relationship. For example, in the moth S. frugiperda, a part of
the intron 5 of one Amy copy was a repeated element, which was
also found in introns of other genes in various Lepidoptera (not shown). Recent
works suggest that DNA repair through nonhomologous end joining could generate
introns from any template, explaining that one rarely discover a
“parental” sequence. This mechanism creates short direct repeats at
the insertion site [61]. This was found in Daphnia for very recent introns
[103].
However, these repeats may diverge quickly as time goes on, so that our data are
unable to show such traces.The protosplice is defined as a preferential target sequence for insertion,
involving the spliceosome machinery [43]. Such sequences have been
shown to be “active” as potential targets for intron insertion [104], [105].
Insertions could alternatively occur at random, with subsequent elimination of
inserts located in an environment not suitable for proper splicing, or
adaptation of the surrounding sequences to improve splicing efficiency; this
hypothesis has been infirmed by [52]. Our data show a global
preference for Amy introns to be surrounded by sequences
matching the conservative protosplice sequence AG/G; interestingly, the
surrounding bases −2 to +2 fitted the protosplice far less well in
“empty” sites (Fig.
3, Table S2). Oldest introns (positions 1, 5, 11) showed a good fit to
the sequence AG/GT, whereas we found gained intron positions for which the
surrounding sequence was completely different (Table S2).
This contrasts with ref. [20], [44] who suggested that old introns are surrounded by
sequences deviating from the protosplice consensus, contrary to more recent
introns. It may be due to the shorter time scale of our study.The multigene nature of Amy genes should not be omitted in this
discussion, since it has been proposed that intron gains are more frequent in
paralogous genes, partly due to relaxation of selective constraints on the
duplicates ([53], discussed in ref. [106]). The conspicuous case of
D. pulex could illustrate this trend. On the other hand, we
also observed more losses in Drosophila Amy genes, in species
that had several gene copies. At a rather short time scale, significant numbers
of gains and losses were found between paralogous genes in A.
thaliana
[98]. In
addition, it has been suggested that, in the case of tandemly arranged genes,
introns tend to diverge in length and sequence to prevent illegitimate
recombination [72]. We have observed such a trend for example in
vertebrates, in the amphioxus, in L. forficatus, in N.
vitripennis.In this single gene study, we have shown that contrasted intron patterns occur
even in the absence of selection for informational content in introns or
alternative splicing, but might depend on mechanistic requirements. Our data
suggest that intron dynamics is a various and changing story, which depends on
both the lineage, even at an intra-phylum scale, and the gene considered, and
also probably depends on the intron position. Hence, we share the wise
conclusion of Jeffares et al. [54]. Additional complete genomes covering much better the
eukaryotes will increasingly enable to draw a much more correct estimate of
intron dynamics at a broader time scale. In addition, comparative genomics of
related species, such as the 12 Drosophila genomes [107], [108], [109], and even
at the intraspecific level (ref. [103] shows an extraordinary snapshot of ongoing intron
gains in waterfleas) bring valuable data at a small time scale, which is the
best way of estimating current rates and mechanisms of intron gain and loss.

PMC3105075,Snapshot of the Eukaryotic Gene Expression in Muskoxen Rumen—A Metatranscriptomic Approach,False,"Herbivores rely on digestive tract lignocellulolytic microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and protozoa, to derive energy and carbon from plant cell wall polysaccharides. Culture independent metagenomic studies have been used to reveal the genetic content of the bacterial species within gut microbiomes. However, the nature of the genes encoded by eukaryotic protozoa and fungi within these environments has not been explored using metagenomic or metatranscriptomic approaches.In this study, a metatranscriptomic approach was used to investigate the functional diversity of the eukaryotic microorganisms within the rumen of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), with a focus on plant cell wall degrading enzymes. Polyadenylated RNA (mRNA) was sequenced on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II system and 2.8 gigabases of sequences were obtained and 59129 contigs assembled. Plant cell wall degrading enzyme modules including glycoside hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases and polysaccharide lyases were identified from over 2500 contigs. These included a number of glycoside hydrolase family 6 (GH6), GH48 and swollenin modules, which have rarely been described in previous gut metagenomic studies.The muskoxen rumen metatranscriptome demonstrates a much higher percentage of cellulase enzyme discovery and an 8.7x higher rate of total carbohydrate active enzyme discovery per gigabase of sequence than previous rumen metagenomes. This study provides a snapshot of eukaryotic gene expression in the muskoxen rumen, and identifies a number of candidate genes coding for potentially valuable lignocellulolytic enzymes.Within the gastrointestinal tract of herbivores a complex group of anaerobic microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, produces a vast array of lignocellulolytic enzymes that in turn digest complex plant cell wall polysaccharides and ferment the released simple sugars. The resulting volatile fatty acids and microbial protein are a source of carbon, nitrogen and energy for the host [1], [2]. Substantial efforts have been made to understand polysaccharide digestion within the rumen through isolation and identification of cellulolytic species, characterization of their enzymes [3], and sequencing the genomes of the major culturable rumen bacteria [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The recent introduction of massively parallel sequencing technologies has enabled the sequencing of herbivore gut microbiomes, including foreguts of cattle and wallabies [10], [11], [12] and the hindgut of termites [13]. These studies have led to the identification of novel cellulolytic enzymes, many of which quite likely arise from the large majority of environmental microbes that are unculturable in the laboratory [4].Despite the prolific activity directed at understanding the rumen microbiome, there is a distinct lack of information about the eukaryotic component of the rumen metagenome and no rumen fungal or protozoal genomes have been reported. Only a small portion of genes described in previous metagenomic studies were attributed to eukaryotes [10], [11], [12], although the role of fungi (Neocallimastigomycota) and protozoa (Litostomatea) in rumen cellulose digestion is widely recognized [14], [15]. The lack of genomic information about anaerobic eukaryotes in the rumen is likely a consequence of 1) the low abundance of eukaryotic DNA in the rumen metagenome; 2) the inadvertent exclusion of eukaryotic species by sample preparation methods; and 3) the failure of bioinformatic analyses to annotate novel eukaryotic gene sequences.Rumen anaerobic fungi not only produce highly active fibrolytic enzymes targeting the plant cell walls, but they also physically disrupt plant cell walls including the cuticle via penetrating rhizoids. Zoospores, the mobile phase of the fungal life cycle, also preferentially colonize lignin-rich regions of the plant cell wall and upon germination, solubilize these regions to a greater extent than rumen bacteria. Studies have shown that rumen fungi may account for up to 8∼20% of the total rumen microbial biomass in ruminants consuming forage [14], [16]. A recent study demonstrated that anaerobic fungi are widely distributed in both ruminant and non-ruminant herbivores [17].The effects of rumen protozoa on fiber digestion are less clear. Previous studies are inconsistent and reports on the effects of protozoa range from an increase of fibre digestion by 50% to a decrease of 15% (for review, see [15]). Studies on the contribution of rumen protozoa to fiber degradation have also been hampered by the difficulty in cultivating protozoa in vitro without the presence of associated bacteria. However, glycoside hydrolase activities and genes have been identified from these organisms [18], [19].Identification of potent lignocellulolytic and other carbohydrate active enzymes are of great interest for industrial processes, such as cellulosic ethanol production [20], [21]. In the present study we applied mRNA-Seq technology [22] to target the polyadenylated eukaryotic mRNA from the muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) rumen microbial consortium. Muskoxen are arctic ruminants that live primarily in northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland. For the majority of the year, their food sources are limited to forages high in lignocellulose content, due to the very short arctic summer [23]. Consequently, we speculated that muskoxen have evolved to harbour a microbial community that efficiently degrades plant cell wall fiber [24]. The sampled muskoxen were maintained at an isolated wildlife research facility (R.G. White Large Animal Research Station, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK) and had not been in contact with domestic ruminants. It was hypothesized that the metatranscriptome approach would lead to the identification of genes coding for novel enzymes and also, for the first time, provide information on the expression of carbohydrate active enzymes by the eukaryotic community in the rumen.In the present study, we adopted a metatranscriptomic approach to identify enzymes from the muskoxen rumen microbial community. We used samples from muskoxen fed on triticale straw and brome hay for deep sequencing with the goal to obtain transcripts encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes. Total RNA was extracted from rumen solids to ensure isolation of the cellulolytic microbial biofilm as well as RNA from microbes deeply embedded in the plant fiber. After purification, the eukaryotic mRNA was sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform. This approach resulted in a total of 25,900,806 reads, with an average read length of 108 nt, generating a total of 2.8 gigabases of sequence data (Figure 1).Raw sequencing reads were assembled into a total of 59,129 contigs with an average length of 310 bp, for a total of 19 M base pairs. The maximum length of the contigs was 13,498 bp, which contained a single open reading frame of 13,083 bp. It encoded for a 4354-amino-acid protein that showed 28% identity to a hypothetical protein from a strain of Orpinomyces
[25]. The size distribution of all the contigs is illustrated (Figure S1). Over 12,000 contigs were represented by 100 or more reads, including 2551 contigs represented by more than 1000 reads and 545 represented by more than 5000 reads. To validate the contig assembly, twenty glycoside hydrolase related contigs (≥500 bp) were chosen and primers designed to amplify the target [Table S2]. Nineteen of the twenty contigs were successfully amplified using at least one set of primers.Using BLASTN searches against the Silva non-redundant large subunit (LSU) and small subunit ribosome (SSU) ribosomal RNA databases coupled with rRNA-HMM and tRNA-scan, we identified 4.77 million non-coding (nc) RNA reads or 18.4% of the total (Figure 1). During the RNA sample preparation step, oligo-dT coated magnetic beads were used to remove a large proportion of rRNA. Assuming ncRNA account for 95% of the original total RNA [26], approximately 99% of this amount was successfully removed as indicated by the percentage of the ncRNA reads identified.The average GC content of ncRNA reads was 51%. In contrast, the GC content of all potential protein encoding RNA reads was 39.2%, a value that was significantly lower than the ncRNA reads and much lower than those reported in metagenomic studies of other microbial communities associated with ocean, fresh water and various animal environments (average %GC 49.56±4.9 [27]). The average GC content of the contigs was 37.9%, which were also lower than other metagenomic studies (Figure S2).BLASTX searches using the 21 million potential protein encoding reads against the trimmed down non-redundant amino acid database (NRMO) from Genbank indicated 7.8 million reads had at least one significant match (E-value ≤10−5). RPS-BLAST searches against the euKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) and the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) identified 6.0 million reads that may have conserved domains (Figure 1), of which 0.9 million reads were not identified by BLASTX searches. The remaining reads (48% of all reads) did not show any similarity to any of the above mentioned databases.The first BLASTX match was used to estimate the possible origin of each putative protein coding RNA reads, according to MEGAN analysis (Figure 2). About 6.6 million reads (31%) showed highest similarity to proteins from the Eukaryota kingdom. Among these, Rumen anaerobic fungi, which belong to the phylum Neocallimastigomycota [28], were represented by 1.4 million reads. Rumen ciliate protozoa, which belong to the Litostomatea class of Alveolata group, were represented by 1.1 million reads. At the genus level, the most represented genera were known rumen/anaerobic species, including Entodinium, Piromyces, Neocallimastix, Trichomonas, Orpinomyces, Entamoeba, and Epidinium, that were represented by over 100,000 reads each (Figure S3). A total of 0.7 million reads (3.4%) and 0.02 million reads (0.1%) were binned to Bacteria and Archaea kingdoms, respectively.The percentages of the major phylogenetic groups were indicated.The sequencing coverage was first assessed by looking at the matches to rumen eukaryotic proteins that were present in the nr database. Rumen anaerobic fungal protein sequences (total of 257) were obtained from the Genbank database as of July, 2010. TBLASTN searches were performed using all of these proteins as queries, and matches to 220 of them (with Expect value ≤1E-20) were found in the muskoxen contigs. Another similar search identified 104 of 107 published rumen protozoal protein sequences in our dataset. The identification of almost all known rumen fungal and protozoal sequences demonstrated the comprehensive coverage of the current sequencing approach.The coverage was further evaluated by plotting collector's curves based on the number of functional gene categories (matched to the KOG database) and gene accession numbers identified (matched to the NRMO database), as a function of the number of reads (Figure 3). Saturating coverage was found for both curves, as roughly 80% of the total richness was found with less than 14% of the sequencing effort.Based the RPS-BLAST search results, 6.0 million reads could be assigned to a cluster of the KOG/COG databases. Most of the assignable sequences belonged to the “Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis” cluster (45% of all the assigned sequences), while Cytoskeleton (16%) was the second largest cluster. Correspondingly, 9 of the top 10 KOG/COGs also belonged to these two categories, with KOG0676 (Actin and related proteins, which were represented by 551,126 reads) and KOG0052 (Translation elongation factor one, 230,087 reads) as the first two abundant KOG groups (Figure S4). These results indicate that these groups of genes were actively transcribed. About 18% of the reads that matched the KOG/COG databases were involved in Metabolism, including metabolism of carbohydrate (7.9%), energy conversion (4.2%) and amino acids (2.6%). KOG/COG groups involved in the glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism were represented by highest read numbers (Table S3), demonstrating genes belonging to those clusters had a central role in the metabolic pathway.Hydrogenosomes are membrane-bound organelles present in anaerobic eukaryotic species such as rumen fungi Neocallimastix and Piromyces as well as rumen protozoa including Eudiplodinium maggii and Dasytricha ruminantium
[29], [30]. Hydrogenosomes are distantly related to mitochondria and are the centre of ATP and hydrogen generation in these microorganisms [30]. In the present rumen metatranscriptome dataset, KOG/COGs linking with hydrogenosomes were also identified, including iron-only hydrogenase, malic enzyme, pyruvate:formate lyase, succinyl-CoA synthetase and acetate:succinate CoA-transferase. Combining the highly expressed KOG/COGs, a representative energy metabolism pathway of muskoxen rumen eukaryotes was reconstructed (Figure S5).Sequence homology based enzyme annotation was biased toward the identification of known enzymes that were already present in the database. To minimize this bias, we used a more sensitive Pfam-HMM search to identify Carbohydrate Active enZYme (CAZy) modules (Figure 4, Table 1, Table S4). In all, these analyses identified 400 k reads potentially encoding lignocellulolytic enzyme modules, spanning about 110 CAZy families. The read number in each family gives an indication of the expression status of that group. However, it needs to be pointed out that the number of reads that matched to lignocellulolytic enzymes was likely underestimated because the short reads (108 nt, translated into 36 amino acid residues maximum) resulted in a less robust database search score than that which would have been obtained using the full sequence of complete genes.The percentages of each enzyme family were shown in the cells. Refer to Table S4 for a complete comparison. Dendrogram on the top indicates the relationship of the GHs identified based on similar percentage distribution.

In total, we identified over 2500 contigs with a significant match to at least one CAZy module (Table S4). Since the use of short contigs may overestimate the total number of enzymes, we further restricted our targets to those contigs longer than 500 base pairs (1082 in total, Tables S4, S5, S6). These contigs, especially those assembled from larger numbers of reads, could serve as good candidates of potentially useful lignocellulolytic enzymes. Only 17% of these contigs were more than 70% identical to genes in the nr database, while 46% of them had less than 50% identity (Figure 5). Seventeen percent of the CAZy genes identified were most similar to nr database sequences annotated as “(Conserved) hypothetical protein”, “predicted protein” or “unnamed protein product”. These results indicated that rumen eukaryotes produce a large variety of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) with many of them remaining uncharacterized. There were 242 contigs that had two or more distinct CAZy domains. Carbohydrate binding domain (CBM) family 10/fungal dockerin domains were predominant in these multi domain enzymes, and were found in 190 (78.5%) of these contigs. Glycoside hydrolases from families GH6, GH45, and GH48 were found in 25, 25 and 23 multi-domain contigs respectively, most of which were linked to CBM10 modules.Most of the muskoxen rumen microbiome cellulases identified were classified as families GH5, 6, 9, 45 and 48, which were represented by 30 to 51 contigs. Similar to other rumen metagenomic studies [10], [11], [12], no contigs showed similarity to family GH7 or GH44. In this study, putative swollenin modules were detected in 16 contigs. Swollenin was reported to dissociate cellulose fiber with no hydrolytic activity [31] and has not been previously reported to be associated with anaerobic microorganisms. Hemicellulose degrading enzymes from GH8, GH10, GH11, GH26 and GH53 were also identified. GH10 and GH11 were the predominant families that were represented by 29 and 33 contigs, respectively. Carbohydrate esterases remove the ester bond on the xylan backbone, exposing it to glycoside hydrolases. There were 111 contigs showing similarity to carbohydrate esterases in the CAZy database. Carbohydrate esterase family 4 (CE4) was the largest family with 50 contigs. The CE1 family, encoding feruloyl esterases important for lignin solubilization in the rumen, was represented by 13 contigs. Twenty seven contigs were annotated to be polysaccharide lyases (Table S4).GH family profiles recovered from the metatranscriptome of muskoxen rumen were compared to the metagenomes of the termite hindgut [13], wallaby foregut [11] and bovine rumen [10], [12], as well as the genomes of several rumen anaerobic bacteria and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of the rumen fungi Piromyces sp. E2 (Figure 4 and Table S4). Clustering analysis of the GH family distribution (Figure 4) showed that the muskoxen metatranscriptome was most closely related to rumen cellulolytic bacteria and the rumen fungus Piromyces. There were some major differences between genes identified by our study and previous metagenome sequencing studies. Approximately 28% of identified glycoside hydrolases were cellulases in the muskoxen rumen transcriptome, as opposed to 8.5% or less in reported rumen metagenome studies. A large number of genes potentially encoding GH6, GH48 and swollenin enzymes identified in the present study were rarely found in other studies of rumen metagenomes. Conversely GH29, 35, 39 and 42 family members described in other rumen metagenome studies [10], [11], [12] were not identified in the rumen metatranscriptome of muskoxen (Figure 5, Table S4).The most abundant accessory module was the carbohydrate binding module of family 10 (CBM10), which was identified from 403 contigs that longer than 500 bp (Table 1). CBM10 has been shown to be associated with many rumen fungal glycoside hydrolases. It was once proposed to be a eukaryotic counterpart of bacterial cellulosomal dockerin [32], but a recent study [33] suggested that the function of this domain differs from bacterial dockerins. Dockerin containing cellulases are known to interact with cellulosome scaffolding proteins in bacteria to form the cellulosome structure. However, a cellulosome scaffolding protein has yet to be identified from rumen fungi. The exact function of CBM10 modules remain to be explored.CBM18, known as a chitin binding module, was the second largest CBM group, and was identified from 108 contigs. Other major CBMs identified included CBM1, CBM6 and CBM13, that presented in 33, 27 and 31 contigs, respectively. Accessory modules that are commonly found in bacterial cellulases, such as bacterial cellulosome dockerin, cohesin, S-layer homolog domain (SLH), cellulase N-terminal immuno-globulin domain (CelD_N) and fibronectin-3 (fn3) modules, were not found in the contigs or reads.Both gene diversity and gene expression information can be obtained from the metatranscriptomic sequencing analysis. To demonstrate the latter, we summarized the read numbers associated with contigs/genes (Tables 2, S5, S6). Cellulase and xylanase genes in families 6, 11, 45 and 48 were over-represented compared to other families (Table 2). GH1 genes, which encode oligosaccharide degrading enzymes, were also over-represented. In addition, a putative family 6 polysaccharide lyase, which has never been reported from eukaryotes, was represented by over 20 k reads.Cellulase activities are well known to be present in microbial communities found in soil, compost, and herbivore digestive tracts including the rumen. Metagenomic technology coupled with high throughput sequencing has enabled the identification of thousands of genes encoding for enzymes that degrade plant cell walls [10], [12], [34]. In the present study, we used rumen solid samples from muskoxen fed a highly lignified diet of triticale straw or brome grass hay. Rumen solids are reportedly responsible for 80∼90% of the endoglucanase and xylanase activities in the rumen [35], [36], as attachment and the formation of digestive microbial biofilms is a prerequisite for the ruminal digestion of feed [35]. By applying an improved isolation method, high quality RNA was extracted from the rumen solids [37]. Combined with an efficient method of de novo assembly of short sequence reads, the present study has provided a comprehensive catalogue of eukaryotic cellulolytic enzymes in the muskoxen rumen, many of which are supported by full-length cDNA information.To our knowledge, we are the first group to report the whole eukaryotic transcriptome of a rumen microbial community. Metatranscriptomic studies have been previously carried out in various microbiomes focused on marine microbial communities [38], [39], [40], [41], and gut microbial population of the piglet [42]. Most of these studies used Roche 454 pyrosequencing technology and although the read lengths were longer than that obtained with Illumina sequencing, far fewer total sequences were produced. In fact most of these studies produced less than 500 M bp of sequences and sample-sequencing depth was low [41]. Illumina sequencing in the present study generated 2.8 gigabases of sequencing data, which is at least 6 times that of previous metatranscriptomic studies [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. The deep sequencing coverage obtained in this study is attested by the observation that the slopes of the collector's curves reached a plateau and that most of the rumen eukaryotic sequences reported in Genbank were identified in the metatranscriptome (331 out of 364 sequences).Metatranscriptomics has distinct properties when compared to metagenomics, the first being that metatranscriptomic analysis identifies most extensively transcribed genes while metagenomic sequencing identifies the most numerically dominant genes. For example, Prevotella is a group of predominant rumen bacteria that at times account for as much as 60% of the total bacteria in the rumen [43], [44], even though they play no active role in the digestion of recalcitrant cellulose [8]. Indeed, the GH profiles of Prevotella ruminicola clustered closely to those of the wallaby and bovine rumen metagenomes, with GHs involved in the degradation of oligosaccharides and hemicelluloses being highly represented, whereas the proportion of GHs related to cellulase were much lower (Figure 4). If a gene encoding a GH was present in a microbial species of low rumen abundance, even if highly expressed, it would be less likely to be recovered by metagenomic sequencing. Such a scenario may be applicable to the rumen anaerobic fungi as they are reported to account for no more than 8% of the total rumen microbial biomass [45]. Secondly, metatranscriptomic analysis may provide insight into the degree of gene expression (Table 2), which could help focus gene mining towards those enzymes that are most active in plant cell wall degradation. Consequently, the yield of potential gene targets for further development may be far higher with metatranscriptomic than metagenomic approaches. A recent rumen metagenomics study using Illumina sequencing technology generated 268 gigabases of metagenomic DNA with about 103 putative carbohydrate active enzymes identified per gigabase [12]. In our present study, we were able to identify 2500 genes in 2.8 gigabases of RNA sequence, translating to 893 putative carbohydrate active enzymes per gigabase.When muskoxen are fed on high fiber diets, cellulolytic microorganisms attach to and penetrate the fiber and expression of many of their cellulolytic enzyme genes is induced. Genes that are highly expressed generate more sequencing reads, increasing sequence coverage, resulting in the assemblage of longer contigs and thereby increases the likelihood of regenerating full length genes or modules. Indeed, of the 59129 contigs in the present study, there were over 2500 contigs with lengths over 1.0 kb and 6022 with lengths between 0.5 to 1 kb (Figure S1). Among the contigs longer than 500 bp, over 1000 of these harboured genes putatively encoding for carbohydrases. Most CAZy genes longer than 500 bp (96%) were represented by 100 or more reads (Table S5/S6), corresponding to an average sequence coverage of about 139 times. These highly expressed CAZy genes are likely to play critical roles in the breakdown of plant fiber by rumen eukaryotes and have potential for use in cellulosic biofuel production as well as other industrial processes.Cellulases from different families often have different substrate specificity and reaction mechanisms. Efficient degradation of the plant cell wall requires synergistic interactions between enzymes with high activity for different substrates [46]. Not surprisingly, we identified cellulases from a wide range of CAZy families. The range of glycoside hydrolases identified showed remarkable differences as compared to previous rumen metagenomic studies. For example, a large number of putative GH6, GH48, and Swollenin genes were identified. All three GH families are important for the degradation of crystalline cellulose, which is the most recalcitrant part of plant cell walls. However, these GH families were not described by earlier metagenomic approaches in the bovine rumen or wallaby foregut [10], [11]. Even in the most recent deep metagenome sequencing study [12], only three GH48 genes were identified [12], while GH6 and Swollenin were still not found. In contrast, our study identified 31 GH6, 33 GH48 and 16 Swollenin genes from rumen eukaryotes and GH6 and GH48 were among the most actively transcribed families (Table S4). These data clearly suggest that rumen eukaryotes play an important role in crystalline cellulose digestion through expression of a large amount of exo-glucanases, which were not detected in other rumen metagenomic studies.The different CAZy families identified by rumen metagenomic studies and our metatranscriptomic study could be due not only to different nucleic acid sequencing targets, but also to the differences in the samples. Muskoxen could have developed a different plant cell wall degrading rumen microflora for survival in the arctic as compared to domesticated cows and sheep. Indeed, our preliminary analysis has identified differences in the microbial population between muskoxen and domesticated cattle (Forster, RJ, personal communication).Assessment of the combined rumen/gut microbiome sequencing information across studies would suggest that the rumen seems to lack cellulases from GH7 and GH12 families. So far, all members of GH7, a family of exo-glucanases, have been isolated from aerobic fungi. The GH7 activity of releasing cellobiose from the reducing end of the cellulose chain may be undertaken by GH48 cellulases within the rumen. Enzymes in family GH12 have been shown to have endoglucanase and xyloglucases activities [47]. Functional aspects of these enzymes may arise from GH74 enzymes in the rumen [48].A total of 3.4% reads showed top BLASTX matches to bacteria (Figure 2) and over half of these reads exhibited the highest similarity to proteins from bacteria that are known as predominant rumen/gut residents, such as families of Fibrobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Lachnospiraceae (Figure S6). However, these bacteria-like reads are very unlikely to come from bacterial mRNA because only enriched polyA RNAs were sequenced, which were rarely found in bacteria mature mRNA. Phylogenetic binning using protein markers also confirmed the absence of bacteria-derived genes in our dataset [Figure S7]. In addition, the GC content of the “bacteria-like” genes identified from muskoxen transcriptome were about 40.1%, which is also within the range of rumen eukaryotic genes identified, but much lower than the average GC content of the metagenomic studies which represents the bacterial population (Figure S2). These findings imply that bacteria-like genes, most of which are involved in a variety of metabolic functions (Figure S8) (including 35% of all CAZy genes identified), may have been horizontally transferred into the genome of rumen eukaryotes, most likely from rumen bacteria, which was demonstrated before [49], [50].Anaerobic fungi and protozoa are the two major groups of eukaryotes in the rumen [51], [52]. In the present study, functional based phylogenetic binning (Figure 2), top BLAST matches of the CAZy enzymes (Figure S9) and phylogenetic analysis based on SSU ribosome RNA sequence (data not shown), all indicated the presence of both groups. There were significantly (χ2 = 348, p<0.0001) more CAZy enzymes matching to rumen fungi than to rumen protozoa (Figure S9), indicating that rumen fungi may play a more significant role for fiber digestion in the muskoxen rumen. However, since there are more CAZy genes from rumen fungi than from protozoa in the nr database (101 vs 28, Table S4), the differences could be due in part to the number of homologues currently present in the database.Eukaryotic anaerobic microbes are poorly understood, especially from a molecular perspective. Although this study focused primarily on genes encoding for enzymes involved in plant cell wall degradation, the data presented greatly expands our current knowledge of these unique eukaryotes and should provide further insight into their co-evolution, metabolism and function within the rumen microbial community.The animals were cared for according to procedures that were approved under protocol # 139821-2 by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK.Ruminal samples were obtained from two cannulated muskoxen at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (Fairbanks, AK) in September, 2009. The muskoxen were mature male castrates with mean body mass between 245 and 271 kg. During a 1-month period, the muskoxen were fed a triticale (Triticosecale) straw or a brome grass hay (Bromus sp.) based high fiber diet, offered twice daily, plus a small amount of protein and mineral supplement once in the morning (335 g/d). See supporting Table S1 for the feed composition. During the last week of the period, rumen samples were obtained in the morning, before the muskoxen were fed. The ruminal contents were transferred to a heavy walled 250 ml beaker and the solid and liquid phases were separated using a Bodum coffee filter plunger (Bodum Inc., Triengen, Switzerland). Subsamples of solid digests (∼2.5 g) were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were frozen within 5 min of the sample being withdrawn from the animal. Samples were immediately transferred to the lab, and stored at −80°C until further processing.Total RNA was isolated from rumen solids according to Wang et al. [37]. The quality of total RNA was estimated by running the samples on RNA 6000 nano chip on an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer.mRNA-Seq libraries were constructed from 100 µg of total RNA using the Illumina mRNA-Seq sample preparation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina Inc, San Diego, USA). Two samples from two individual muskoxen (one fed triticale straw, one fed brome grass hay) were combined and sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyze II system at the McGill University/Genome Quebec Innovation Centre. Obtained sequencing reads were assembled de novo using a combination of Velvet (available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/) [53] and CAP3 (available at http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/cap3.php) [54] programs as described in Methods S1 and validated by reverse transcription PCR. The contigs were then clustered together at 95% sequence identity over 80% of their lengths using the DNA version of CD-HIT in the Rammcap package [55].To validate the contig assemblies, 20 contigs containing different putative carbohydrate active enzyme genes were amplified using primers designed specifically for each contig. The target contigs and primer sequences are listed in Table S2. Briefly, the muskoxen total RNA samples were reverse transcribed using a Superscript III kit and oligo-dT primers (Invitrogen). PCRs were carried out using Platinum Taq polymerase Hi Fidelity (Invitrogen) using the conditions recommended by the manufacturer.All sequence analyses, unless otherwise specified were performed using both the reads and the assembled contigs. The databases employed for this analysis were the latest versions available during the analysis period (Jun 2010 to Dec 2010). The genome sequence of the rumen bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 (Accession No. {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NC_013410"",""term_id"":""261414414"",""term_text"":""NC_013410""}}NC_013410), expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of rumen protozoa [50] and rumen fungi Pyromyces sp. E2, were retrieved from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Genbank databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).Ribosomal RNA sequences were firstly identified by BLASTN searches against LSU and SSU ribosomal RNA databases (Version 104) from the ARB-Silva database [56]. Subsequently, all the sequences were further analyzed by the rRNA-hmm [57] and tRNA-scan [58] programs in the Rammcap package [55], using the default settings. The sequences that had E-values equal or less than 10−5 (bit score ≥52) and overlap ≥50 bp to entries in the SSU/LSU database, as well as those identified by rRNA-hmm program (SSU rRNA, LSU rRNA and tRNA) are referred to as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in this paper.Function-based taxonomy binning was carried out with the top BLASTX hits to the trimmed down non-redundant amino acid database (NRMO) using the MEGAN software [59] as well as phylogenetic analysis on protein coding marker gene sequences (Methods S1).The non-ncRNA sequences were searched using RPS-BLAST against both the KOG and the COG databases and the Genbank non-redundant amino acid (nr) database. Bacteria-like reads identified by nr BLASTX were further searched against the COG database. The functional roles of the sequences were assigned based on the KOG and COG searches. The matches that had E-values equal or less than 10−5 were considered significant.Lignocellulolytic gene containing reads and contigs were identified and classified based on the Carbohydrate Active enZYme (CAZy) database [60] as described by Warnecke and colleagues [13] with the following modification. Both HMMER3 [61] and BLASTX searches were carried out as follows: Step A) Glycoside hydrolase and carbohydrate binding module (CBM) families that have associated Pfam HMMs (v24.0) [11] were used directly for HMMER hmmsearch. Step B) In an attempt to associate Pfam HMMs to CAZy families without such models, all members of these CAZy families were searched against the Pfam-A and Pfam-B databases (v24.0). Results were manually checked and Pfam HMMs were conservatively chosen for a CAZy family only when the following two criteria were met: i) all hits to that Pfam group were from the same CAZy family; ii) At least 80% of group members were identified to conform to the conserved Pfam model. In instances where one Pfam HMM model represented members from two or more closely related CAZy groups, a class of combined CAZy groups was assigned. Step C) For those CAZy families that currently are not represented by a Pfam model, the representative sequences as described by Warnecke et al [13], were used in BLASTX searches with a score cut-off of 52. Step D) For CAZy families with neither a Pfam accession nor representative amino acid sequences, an HMM profile was built based on T-coffee [62] alignment of representative members selected from the CAZy web site and used for HMMER3.To compare genes coding for carbohydrate active proteins identified in the muskoxen rumen metatranscriptome with other genomes/metagenomes, the percentages of glycoside hydrolase families were calculated. A two-dimensional matrix was constructed, consisting of the GHs that were identified from genomes or metagenomes, wherein each cell in the matrix indicated how often a GH family was seen within a particular sample. Pearson correlation coefficients of each two samples were calculated and transformed into distances and clustered by using the unweighted pair group method with the arithmetic mean algorithm as previously described [49], [63].The sequencing reads are available from the NCBI short read archive under Accession number SRA030623.1.

PMC3105668,Proteome insights into the symbiotic relationship between a captive colony of Nasutitermes corniger and its hindgut microbiome,False,"We analyzed the metaproteome of the bacterial community resident in the hindgut paunch of the wood-feeding ‘higher' termite (Nasutitermes) and identified 886 proteins, 197 of which have known enzymatic function. Using these enzymes, we reconstructed complete metabolic pathways revealing carbohydrate transport and metabolism, nitrogen fixation and assimilation, energy production, amino-acid synthesis and significant pyruvate ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase protein redundancy. Our results suggest that the activity associated with these enzymes may have more of a role in the symbiotic relationship between the hindgut microbial community and its termite host than activities related to cellulose degradation.Within the family Termitidae (higher termites), the P3 segment (hindgut paunch) microbiome is capable of fixing nitrogen and potentially degrading lignocellulose (Breznak and Brune, 1994). In contrast to the families of ‘lower termites' (for example, Kalotermitidae, Rhinotermitidae), where flagellated protists and the termite are sources of cellulases (Cleveland, 1923; Watanabe et al., 2002; Tokuda et al., 2004), the contribution and sources of hydrolytic enzymes in the higher termite are not well defined. For example, a recent metagenomic study of the Nasutitermes P3 microbiome (Warnecke et al., 2007) identified domains representative of several families of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy families) (Cantarel et al., 2009) and then used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics to look for evidence of CAZy expression.We report results from a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based global proteome characterization (Supplementary Materials and Methods) of the Nasutitermes (laboratory maintained colony collected in Dania Beach, FL) P3 microbiome, in which we searched for evidence supporting CAZy family expression. Metaproteomic and metagenomic data sets were obtained from different termite nests. We observed 886 proteins (Supplementary Information) identified using ⩾2 unique peptide sequences as a requirement for confident protein identification. The confidently identified proteins represent 1.2% of the predicted proteome (based on the metagenomic sequence); however, these proteins make up 235 protein families (Pfams) or 11.5% of the 2050 Pfams predicted by the metagenome. The limited coverage may reflect the small volume of P3 hindgut fluid available for analysis (100 μl equates to ∼100 P3 hindguts), but suggests that the identified proteins are the most abundant and/or easily detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Among the 886 proteins, 70 are unannotated and 58 are characterized as hypothetical, predicted or putative in the annotation. The most represented proteins are flagellin-related hook-associated proteins and methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins that contain 50 and 43 copies (redundancy), respectively. Chemotaxis is hypothesized to have an important role in compartmentalizing bacteria to specific regions of the termite gut according to the functional roles of the bacteria (Warnecke et al., 2007).Of the 886 proteins identified in this study, 197 had Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, which allowed us to construct enzymatic pathways and gain insight into the molecular mechanisms defining the symbiotic relationship between the P3 hindgut microbiome and its termite host. Figure 1 shows expressed genes for transport, glucan binding, sugar fermentation, hydrogen metabolism, amino-acid synthesis, and nitrogen fixation and assimilation pathways. The transportation and fermentation pathways are of particular interest with regard to possible energy substrates available for the microbiome. For example, xylose (wood sugar) is transported into the cytoplasm by ATPases (EC3.6.3.17), and glucose, monosaccharide and disaccharide substrates are transported into the bacterial cells through the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (EC2.7.1.69). Phosphotransferase catalyzes phosphorylation of these incoming sugar substrates simultaneously with their translocation across the cell membrane, after which phosphorylated glucose (glucose-6P) can be metabolized and phosphorylated disaccharide can be broken down by β-glucan hydrolases (EC2.4.1.-). The collective actions of many bacterial enzymes transport and metabolize reducing sugars to alcohol, energy (ATP) and acetate (Supplementary Table S1). Bacterial acetate is a dominant end product for energy and biosynthesis in the termite; however, molecular hydrogen (H2) is an alternative energy source and is abundantly produced during both lignocellulose fermentation and N2 fixation. H2 is metabolized by iron-only hydrogenase enzymes (EC1.6.5.3) (Vignais and Colbeau, 2004).Molecular snapshot of the metabolic pathways within the termite gut microbial community. The enzymatic pathways of multiple enzymes are illustrated. Black arrows represent complete pathways; every enzyme was identified. Gray arrows and gray text represent incomplete pathways. The legend is color coded to the EC numbers. Ala, alanine; Arg, arginine; Asp, aspartate; Cys, cysteine; Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate; Ile, isoleucine; Leu, leucine; Met, methionine; Phe, phenylalanine; PPi, pyrophosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; Ser, serine; THF, tetrahydrofolate; Trp, tryptophan; Tyr, tyrosine; Val, valine.Importantly, the sugar fermentation and nitrogen fixation pathways are coupled by the activity of pyruvate ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase (EC1.2.7.-) through oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA under anaerobic conditions (Figure 1). The electrons generated from this reaction are transferred to ferredoxin (or some other electron carrier) and are used by nitrogenase in the reduction of N2. Pyruvate ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase was observed with the highest degree of redundancy among the 197 enzymes, that is, 24 observed copies (Supplementary Table S2). Within this group, 4 copies (out of a possible 6) are annotated as EC1.2.7.- in the metagenome (Supplementary Figure S1, Supplementary Table 1). The role of this enzyme in acetate and nitrogen fixation and its high degree of redundancy suggest this enzyme's catalytic function is critical to the microbiome and the termite. The reported absence of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (aerobic conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA) in Nasutitermes walkeri tissues (Slaytor et al., 1997) and other termites (O'Brien and Breznak, 1984) has led to a long-standing hypothesis that acetate production by the microbiome is critical for producing energy in the termite (reviewed by Breznak and Brune (1994)). More recently, activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was reported for mitochondria extracted from N. walkeri and Coptotermes formosanus; however, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in whole tissue homogenates remained elusive (Itakura et al., 2003).After global characterization, we looked for supporting evidence of CAZy family expression. To improve the likelihood of observing these Pfams, we prepared samples from several fractionations of the hindgut fluid (Supplementary Materials and Methods and Supplementary Table S3) based on cellulase activity recently reported in similar fractions for Nasutitermes species (Tokuda and Watanabe, 2007). We searched our data for proteins having domains previously identified by Warnecke et al. (2007), using Pfam hidden Markov models (Krogh et al., 1994) (Supplementary Materials and Methods) and associated with glycoside hydrolysis and carbohydrate binding (Table 1). We identified 48 proteins within 22 CAZy and Pfams, of which 13 were reported for Nasutitermes (Warnecke et al., 2007). However, of these 48 proteins, only 8 within 6 families passed the ⩾2 unique peptide filtering criterion. The absence of confidently observed enzymes involved in cellulose degradation maybe because of these enzymes not being readily detected using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (for example, secreted CAZy enzymes were insoluble and/or remained firmly bound to lignocellulose), the need for a more representative genome, or that native cellulose degradation may occur elsewhere in the termite. A recent report of an abundance of endo-β-1,4-glucanase in the midgut of Nasutitermes suggests that early stages of native cellulose degradation may depend on enzymes secreted by the termite host before complete degradation by the microbiome (Tokuda and Watanabe, 2007). In conclusion, the presented proteomic data shed further light on which genes are expressed to support the symbiotic relationship between the hindgut microbiome and its host.The research described in this paper was funded by the Genomes to Life program sponsored by the US Department of Energy's Office of Biological and Environmental Research and performed in the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, a national scientific user facility sponsored by the DOE's Office of Biological and Environmental Research and located at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

PMC3105739,Phylogenetic and gene-centric metagenomics of the canine intestinal microbiome reveals similarities with humans and mice,False,"This study is the first to use a metagenomics approach to characterize the phylogeny and functional capacity of the canine gastrointestinal microbiome. Six healthy adult dogs were used in a crossover design and fed a low-fiber control diet (K9C) or one containing 7.5% beet pulp (K9BP). Pooled fecal DNA samples from each treatment were subjected to 454 pyrosequencing, generating 503 280 (K9C) and 505 061 (K9BP) sequences. Dominant bacterial phyla included the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes, both of which comprised ∼35% of all sequences, followed by Proteobacteria (13–15%) and Fusobacteria (7–8%). K9C had a greater percentage of Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria, whereas K9BP had greater proportions of the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes. Archaea were not altered by diet and represented ∼1% of all sequences. All archaea were members of Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, with methanogens being the most abundant and diverse. Three fungi phylotypes were present in K9C, but none in K9BP. Less than 0.4% of sequences were of viral origin, with >99% of them associated with bacteriophages. Primary functional categories were not significantly affected by diet and were associated with carbohydrates; protein metabolism; DNA metabolism; cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and pigments; amino acids and derivatives; cell wall and capsule; and virulence. Hierarchical clustering of several gastrointestinal metagenomes demonstrated phylogenetic and metabolic similarity between dogs, humans and mice. More research is required to provide deeper coverage of the canine microbiome, evaluate effects of age, genetics or environment on its composition and activity, and identify its role in gastrointestinal disease.Despite being a member of the order Carnivora, the domestic dog is omnivorous in nature and consumes a considerable amount of dietary carbohydrate, including fibrous materials, commonly present in commercial pet foods. Dogs do not rely heavily on microbial fermentation as it pertains to energy requirements, but balanced and stable microbiota are critical for maintaining gastrointestinal health. Characterizing the canine microbiome is important for several reasons. First, similar gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology, dietary patterns, metabolic processes and intestinal disease etiology make the dog an effective human model for intestinal health and disease (as reviewed by Swanson and Schook, 2006). Second, most pet dogs in developed countries are now treated as family, with many not only living in the home but also eating, sleeping and playing with their owners. This close proximity has relevance in terms of zoonotic disease. Several recent case reports have demonstrated a direct link between human illness and pet dogs (Ngaage et al., 1999; Sato et al., 2000).Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the predominant microbial phyla in the human gut (Eckburg et al., 2005; Gill et al., 2006). Knowledge of the canine gut microbiome lags behind that of humans, but has improved recently with the increased speed and reduced cost of next-generation sequencing technologies (Suchodolski et al., 2009). Recent sequencing data from our laboratories suggest that Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria co-dominate the colon of healthy dogs (Suchodolski et al., 2008a; Middelbos et al., 2010). Suchodolski et al. (2008a) compared small and large intestinal populations and noted that Clostridiales predominated in the duodenum and jejunum, whereas Fusobacteriales and Bacteroidales were the most abundant bacterial order in the ileum and colon. Enterobacteriales were more commonly observed in the small intestine than in the colon, and Lactobacillales were commonly present in all parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal disease is often associated with alterations in small intestinal microbiota, some of which have also been identified in dogs. Results from several recent studies have identified distinct gut microbial populations in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease as compared with healthy controls (Xenoulis et al., 2008; Suchodolski et al., 2010; Allenspach et al., 2010). Duodenal samples from dogs with inflammatory bowel disease had reduced species richness, were enriched with the Enterobacteriaceae family and also differed in Clostridiaceae, Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes populations. These recent experiments have provided a strong foundation on which to build, although further experimentation with greater coverage is sorely needed.Culture-independent, 16S rRNA gene-based techniques have greatly expanded our knowledge of bacterial phylogeny, but do not provide information pertaining to function. A metagenomics approach is advantageous because it provides a view of community structure (species richness and distribution), including fungi, archaeal and viral genomes, as well as functional (metabolic) potential (Hugenholtz and Tyson, 2008). This strategy will enhance our understanding of host–microbe relationships, with application to host metabolism and disease. Recent metagenome projects have revealed the functional capacity of the gastrointestinal organisms in numerous species, including humans (Kurokawa et al., 2007; Turnbaugh et al., 2009), rodents (Turnbaugh et al., 2006, 2008), cattle (Brulc et al., 2009) and poultry (Qu et al., 2008). To our knowledge, however, the canine gastrointestinal metagenome has not been characterized and was the primary objective of this experiment.Six healthy adult female hound-cross dogs (Canis lupus familiaris; Marshall Bioresources, North Rose, NY, USA) were used. All dogs were 1.7 years old (three pairs of littermates born within 5 days of each other) and had a mean body weight of 20.3 kg (individual body weight=17.9, 18.3, 18.7, 20.0, 21.6 and 25.3 kg). The dogs were housed individually under environmentally controlled conditions (22 °C, 12-h light:12-h dark cycle) at the Small Animal Clinic of the University of Illinois, College of Veterinary Medicine. All animal care procedures have been described by Middelbos et al. (2010) and were approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee before conducting the experiment. Experimental diets were formulated to meet all nutritional recommendations for adult dogs provided by the Association of American Feed Control Officials, (2009). Primary ingredients of both diets included brewer's rice, poultry by-product meal, poultry fat, dried egg and vitamin and mineral premixes. The control diet (C) contained no supplemental dietary fiber, whereas the fiber-supplemented diet (BP) included 7.5% beet pulp in place of brewer's rice. Control and BP diets were similar in protein (29.7 vs 28.0%), fat (19.4 vs 21.0%) and ash (6.8 vs 7.1%) composition, but contained different fiber concentrations (1.4 vs 4.5% total dietary fiber). The complete list of dietary ingredients and chemical composition is presented in Middelbos et al. (2010).A crossover design with two 14-day periods was used. Dogs were randomly assigned to one of two diets in the first period and received the other diet in the second period. Dogs were fed 300 g of diet once daily, which was determined to meet the metabolizable energy needs of the heaviest dog based on National Research Council, (2006) recommendations. At each feeding, uneaten food from the previous feeding was collected and weighed. A 4-day collection phase followed a 10-day diet adaptation phase, during which fresh (within 15 min of defecation) fecal samples were collected from each dog. Fresh feces were immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction.Genomic DNA was extracted and isolated from fecal samples using a modification of the method of Yu and Morrison, (2004) and described by Middelbos et al. (2010). After extraction, DNA was quantified using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). All six samples from each treatment were pooled on an equimolar basis.Samples were subjected to pyrosequencing using a 454 Genome Sequencer using FLX titanium reagents (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Both unassembled reads and assembled contigs were analyzed separately. Sequences derived from pyrosequencing were quality trimmed on the basis of N50 values. For unassembled analyses, the data set was depleted of sequences <200bp. For assembled analyses, a de novo assembly was performed using NGen (DNAstar, Madison, WI, USA) with a minimum match percentage of 90%, a mismatch penalty of 25, a match size of 19, gap penalty of 25 and no repeat handling. Contigs from each of the data sets were uploaded to MG-RAST (Meyer et al., 2008) and WebCARMA (Gerlach et al., 2009) and annotated. Unassembled reads were also loaded into MG-RAST and into IMG/M ER (Markowitz et al., 2008). Comparisons were made between the canine beet pulp (K9BP) and canine control (K9C) diet-assembled canine metagenome data sets (MG-RAST accession numbers 4444165 and 4444164, respectively), and contrasts were also evaluated against 5 MG-RAST public-assembled data sets that included chicken cecum A contigs (CCA 4440285), lean mouse cecum (LMC 4440463.3), obese mouse cecum (OMC 4440464), human stool metagenome (HSM 4444130) and human F1-S feces metagenome (F1S 4440939). Parameters were limited by a maximum e-value of 0.01, minimum percent identity of 50, minimum alignment length of 50 and raw score maximum of 0.3. Hierarchal clustering was performed using NCSS 2007 (Kaysville, Utah). Wards minimum variance clustering was performed using unscaled Manhattan distances according to the procedure described in the study by Kaufman and Rousseeuw, (1990).Although dogs normally consume low to moderate levels of dietary fiber and do not rely heavily on fermentation for meeting their energy needs, the presence of a stable gut microbial community is crucial for intestinal health. Next generation sequencing technologies have recently been used to characterize the identity and functional capacity of a variety of microbial communities, including the gastrointestinal tracts of mammalian species. To our knowledge, however, this is the first metagenomic data set generated from the canine gastrointestinal tract. Pyrosequencing generated a total of 1008341 sequences. Assembly of the 505061 K9BP fecal metagenome sequences resulted in 422653 sequences being assembled into 67761 contigs with 1937 contigs >2 kb. The average contig length was 648 bp, with an average of six sequences per contig. Of the 503280 K9C sequences, 424522 sequences were assembled into 66969 contigs with 2871 contigs >2 kb. The average contig length was 799 bp, with an average of six sequences per contig. The K9 metagenome projects were submitted to NCBI with accession numbers 38653 and 38651. The sequences were also submitted to NCBI short read archive under accession number SRA008853.1.For K9BP, 70.34% of the sequences evaluated were matched to SEED subsystems (using an e-value of 1e–5). There were 47,691 hits against the non-redundant protein database. For the K9C data set, 76.46% of the sequences matched SEED subsystems, with 51205 non-redundant hits. Table 1 provides an overview of these phylogenetic computations. Both metagenomes had a similar microbial profile when viewed at major taxonomic levels. As expected, the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group and Firmicutes were the predominant phyla in our canine fecal samples, both of which represented ∼35% of all sequences. Proteobacteria (13–15%) and Fusobacteria (7–8%) were the other predominant phyla present in our samples. WebCARMA analyses demonstrated similar trends in K9C (Supplementary Figure 1) and K9BP (Supplementary Figure 2) samples, with Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria being the predominant phyla present (in descending order).16S rRNA gene-based (variable region three) pyrosequencing data from these same fecal samples highlighted the predominance of these similar phyla, but with a lower prevalence of Bacteroidetes (27–34%), Firmicutes (17–27%) and Proteobacteria (5–7%), and much higher prevalence of Fusobacteria (27–44% Middelbos et al., 2010). Although it is difficult to identify the source of variation between these methodologies, especially in Fusobacteria, biases involved with the generation of amplicons (for example, primer bias and so on) for the 16S rRNA gene-based method may have contributed to this discrepancy. In another recent study, in which near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were generated from a clone library of healthy canine colon samples, Firmicutes represented ∼40% of sequences, whereas Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria both represented 30% each (Suchodolski et al., 2008a). These recent studies suggest that the predominant phyla of the canine gut microbiome are similar to that of humans (Eckburg et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008) and mice (Ley et al., 2005), both of which are also dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The significance of an enriched Fusobacteria population in the dog gut is unknown, however, and deserves more attention in future studies.Assuming that metagenome sequencing represented a random sample of read counts and that each group was independent of the other, it seems that K9C dogs had a greater percentage of Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, whereas K9BP had greater read counts of Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi and Firmicutes (Table 2). Increased Firmicutes read counts in the current (metagenomic) data set were primarily due to decreased Clostridia in K9BP as compared with K9C, whereas changes in Proteobacteria were primarily related to Gammaproteobacteria. Despite the differences in overall read counts between the metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene-derived data sets, effects of dietary fiber on phylum prevalence were similar between them (Middelbos et al., 2010). Microbial phylogeny is known to respond to dietary alterations, including the amount and type of dietary fiber or other bioactive food components, as demonstrated by recent experiments performed in mice (Turnbaugh et al., 2008), rats (Abnous et al., 2009) and humans (Li et al., 2009b). However, characterizing dietary-induced changes in the canine microbiome using high-throughput sequencing technologies has not been performed until now, and deserves more attention in future experiments.Results of this study were compared with data sets within MG-RAST that had similar data characteristics, including sequence number, longest sequence and average sequence length (Table 3). Paired data from studies were chosen, such as lean (LMC) and obese (OMC) mouse cecal metagenomes (Turnbaugh et al., 2006) and two human fecal metagenomes (F1S; HSM). F1S was considered to be a healthy human fecal metagenome (Kurokawa et al., 2007), whereas HSM was defined as human feces from a malnourished subject, as well as a chicken cecal metagenome (CCA) (Qu et al., 2008). The results of such comparisons have inherent assumptions on the basis of the methods and version of the database used for generating the data and parameters used to assemble the data. Results were evaluated at the phylogenetic level (Figure 1) and at the metabolic level (Figure 2). Within the phylogenetic comparison based on a double hierarchical dendogram, the two canine samples clustered together and more closely with the healthy human and mouse metagenomes than with the obese mouse metagenome. The chicken cecum metagenome was the greatest outlier as might be expected. In all samples, the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were most abundant. The canine metagenome was most distinguished by its greater prevalence of Fusobacteria as compared with humans and mice, as can be seen in the heat map in Figure 1. The heat map also demonstrates that the canine metagenome contained lower Actinobacteria and greater Fibrobacteres/Acidobacteria as compared with humans and mice. Finally, Spirochaetes were identified in all of the metagenomes, and Firmicutes were notably lower in the chicken cecal metagenome that was largely predominated by Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. Similar clustering against mouse and human data was performed in IMG/M ER (http://merced.jgi-psf.org/cgi-bin/mer/main.cgi). As Supplementary Figure 3 demonstrates, canine samples clustered together and were most similar to human gut samples, which also clustered together, and were followed by lean and obese mouse gut samples.Phylogenetic clustering of canine, human, mouse and chicken gastrointestinal metagenomes. A double hierarchical dendogram, using the weighted-pair group clustering method and the Manhattan distance method with no scaling, shows phylogenetic distribution of microorganisms among canine (K9C; K9BP), human (F1S; HSM), murine (LMC; OMC) and chicken (CCA) metagenomes. Dendogram linkages of the bacterial classes are not phylogenetic, but based on relative abundance of the taxonomic designations within samples. The heat map depicts the relative percentage of each class of microorganism (variables clustering on the y axis) within each sample (x axis clustering). The heat map colors represent the relative percentage of the microbial designations within each sample, with the legend indicated at the upper left corner. The samples along the x axis with Manhattan distances are indicated by branch length and an associated scale located at the upper right corner. Clustering based on Manhattan distance of the bacterial classes along the y axis and their associated scale is indicated in the lower left corner.Metabolic clustering of canine, human, mouse and chicken gastrointestinal metagenomes. A double hierarchical dendogram, using the weighted-pair group clustering method and the Manhattan distance method with no scaling, shows bacteria distribution (classes) among canine (K9C; K9BP), human (F1S; HSM), murine (LMC; OMC) and chicken (CCA) metagenomes. Dendogram linkages are based on relative abundance of the metabolic classes (variables) within the samples. Clustering of the samples was similarly based on comparative abundance of the metabolic classes among individual samples. The heat map depicts the relative percentage of each metabolic class (variables clustering on y axis) within each sample (x axis clustering). The heat map colors represent the relative percentage of the metabolic classes within each sample, with the legend indicated at the upper left corner. The samples along the x axis with Manhattan distances are indicated by branch length and an associated scale located at the upper right corner. Clustering based on Manhattan distance of the metabolic classes along the y axis and their associated scale is indicated in the lower left corner.Archaea constituted a minor part of the canine metagenome, representing ∼1% of all sequencing reads. No significant effect of diet on the distribution of archaea was observed. Independent of diet, two distinct archaeal phyla were identified. In the canine samples, Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota comprised 9 classes and 10 orders (Table 4). Methanogenic archaea were the most abundant and diverse group.The overall abundance of archaea within the human and mice metagenome was similar to that of dogs. Cluster analysis based on the cosine similarity coefficient revealed that the sample from HSM showed the highest similarity to the canine samples (Supplemental Figure 4). Sample HSM had a high diversity of methanogens, comprising several classes (Methanobacteria, Methanococci, Methanomicrobia and Methanopyri). In contrast, human sample F1S clustered together with the mice metagenomes OMC and LMC. Although methanogens were also the most abundant group in these latter samples, they showed a lower diversity. In CCA, only one highly predominant operational taxonomic unit was evident, and this metagenome clustered separately. Compared with human, mice and chicken metagenomes, dogs were depleted of Sulfolobales, Halobacteriales and Nanoarchaeum.Archaea are commensal organisms in the intestine of ruminants and have also been described recently in the intestine of humans, with Methanobacteriales most commonly reported (Eckburg et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009). To our knowledge, archaea have not been described in detail in dogs. Middelbos et al. (2008) demonstrated in vitro methanogenesis in canine fecal samples, but a phylogenetic characterization of the archaeal phylotypes has not been provided. There is no clear role for archaea in the intestine. Typically, they are considered commensals, but because of mutualistic interactions with other microorganisms they may contribute to pathogenicity (Conway de Macario and Macario, 2009). Methanogens reduce hydrogen into methane, promoting an environment that enhances growth of polysaccharide fermenting bacteria, leading to a higher energy utilization of the diet. Higher numbers of methanogenic archaea have been observed in obese humans (Zhang et al., 2009). Methanogens have also been associated with periodontal disease in humans (Li et al., 2009a). The true prevalence and medical importance of archaea will need to be determined in dogs.A low abundance of fungi sequences was identified in the K9C and no sequences were observed in the K9BP data set. All fungi sequences were classified as Dikarya. Only three distinct phylotypes were identified, and all were at low (0.01%) abundance of the canine metagenome: Gibberella zeae PH-1, Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Interestingly, the latter two phylotypes were the only ones identified in the OMC and CCA metagenomes, respectively. Fungi in the intestinal ecosystem have not yet been studied extensively in dogs. Using culture-dependent methods, only a few studies mention the presence of fungi in the canine gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, ileum, colon and rectum, in ∼25% of dogs (Davis et al., 1977; Benno et al., 1992; Mentula et al., 2005). Using a panfungal PCR assay, a higher prevalence of fungi DNA (76% of dogs) was reported in the proximal small intestine in healthy dogs and in dogs with chronic enteropathies (Suchodolski et al., 2008b). In that study, a total of 51 different phylotypes were identified across 135 dogs, but the species richness within individual dogs was low, with the majority of dogs harboring only one phylotype. Fungi DNA was detected at significantly higher proportion in mucosal brush samples than in luminal content.Using oligonucleotide fingerprinting of ribosomal RNA genes (OFRG), a high fungi diversity and four fungi phyla were observed in the intestine of mice (Scupham et al., 2006). In that study, fungi were observed mostly adjacent to the colonic epithelial cells and to a lesser extent in fecal material. Scanlan and Marchesi, (2008) measured human distal gut fungi using culture-dependent and -independent methods, demonstrating the biases that occur with culture methods. Cultured fungi were predominantly of Candida origin, whereas those identified by molecular techniques included Saccharomyces, Gloeotinia, Penicillium, Candida and Galactomyces. Similar fungi phylotypes (Candida, Cladosporium, Penicillium and Saccharomyces) were identified in stool samples from patients with human inflammatory bowel disease and from healthy controls (Ott et al., 2008). In that study, fungi represented a low percentage (0.3%) of the overall fecal flora. Colon biopsy samples contained a much greater diversity of fungi, with nearly five times more operational taxonomic unit reported in biopsies compared with stool samples (Ott et al., 2008). We observed a low number of fungi phylotypes in dogs in this study. It is possible that fungi constitute only a minor fraction of the gut metagenome and the true diversity has been underestimated in this study. Deeper sequencing efforts will likely yield a more accurate characterization of the fungi ecosystem. It is also possible that fungi are less prevalent in luminal content and fecal material, compared with mucosal samples, as previously shown in dogs, mice and humans (Scupham et al., 2006; Ott et al., 2008; Suchodolski et al., 2008b), and have been therefore underestimated in this study.Less than 1% of all sequences were classified as being of viral origin (Table 1). Only the orders Caudovirales and Iridoviridae were identified. Within the Caudovirales, three families were observed (Myoviridae, Podoviridae and Siphoviridae) and all sequences were classified as bacteriophages (Supplementary Table 1). In dogs, the knowledge about the presence of viral communities in the gastrointestinal tract is limited to a few families (including rotavirus, coronavirus and parvovirus). Recent studies in humans revealed that the viral community in the gastrointestinal tract is highly diverse, with several hundred different phylotypes (Breitbart et al., 2003). It is likely that a similar diverse viral community is present in dogs and cats, but their in-depth characterization will require deeper sequence coverage. Moreover, our approach allowed only the discovery of dsDNA. Future studies will need to survey for RNA viruses to complete our understanding of the viral intestinal ecosystem.To our knowledge, this experiment was the first to use pyrosequencing and a metagenomics approach to characterize the metabolic capacity of canine gut microbiota and test the effects of supplemental dietary fiber. Approximately half (59.07% for K9C; 48.23% for K9BP) of all sequences in our data set were classified metabolically and are summarized in Table 5 (MG-RAST) and Supplementary Figures 5 and 6 (webCARMA). Beet pulp contains a mixture of fermentable and non-fermentable fibers and is commonly used by the pet food industry. Although phylogenetic changes were noted, the inclusion of 7.5% beet pulp did not greatly alter gene sequence number of any KEGG functional categories. The most represented functional categories included carbohydrates; protein metabolism; cell wall and capsule; cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and pigments; DNA metabolism; RNA metabolism; amino acids and derivatives; and virulence.Microbial carbohydrate metabolism seemed to be unaffected by diet in the present study, as the relative sequence abundance of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism was not greatly changed between dogs and was comparable with those in the core metagenome reported in a previous study of monozygotic human twins (∼12.75% compared with ∼12.00%, respectively; Turnbaugh et al., 2009). However, certain subcategories of carbohydrate metabolism were affected by the addition of beet pulp to the diet. For example, genes related to -rhamnose usage were twice as abundant in the K9C microbiome as compared with that of K9BP. Although these genes comprise a very small percentage of the total gene number identified (0.34% of sequences for K9C; 0.17% for K9BP), it suggests that the microbiota are being exposed to different carbohydrate concentrations when fed diets of different types or amounts of fiber substrates. Other genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, such as those related to mannose metabolism (0.54% for K9C; 0.58% for K9BP) and fructooligosaccharide and raffinose metabolism (0.29% for K9C; 0.21% for K9BP), did not reflect major differences between diets and may be due to very low dietary concentrations or low amounts present in the distal colon due to fermentation in the proximal bowel.As a percentage of sequences, protein metabolism genes were enriched in K9BP. On further analysis, it seemed that K9BP had enriched protein biosynthesis and secretion. The largest changes within protein biosynthesis included regulation of transcription, tRNA aminoacylation (2.05% for K9C; 2.24% for K9BP) and universal GTPases (0.91% for K9C; 1.0% for K9BP). Because dogs fed the beet pulp diet (K9BP) likely had more available substrate for bacterial fermentation, this increase in protein biosynthesis simply may be the result of higher metabolic activity and/or growth of microbial populations present in this group. General protein secretion pathways were also enriched in dogs fed the beet pulp diet (0.4% for K9C; 0.51% for K9BP), but genes associated with amino acids and derivatives were unaffected by diet. Genes associated with protein degradation and protein folding seemed to be enriched in K9C.Genes involved with the biosynthesis of vitamin K and the B vitamins were predominant in the cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups and pigments subsystem in the present study. Although differences due to dietary groups were not apparent, the data set was enriched with genes associated with the biosynthesis of folate (0.91% for K9C; 0.94% for K9BP), coenzyme B12 (0.69% for K9C; 0.79% for K9BP), biotin (0.19% for K9C and K9BP), vitamin B6 (0.18% for K9C and K9BP), thiamin (0.45% for K9C; 0.49% for K9BP), riboflavin (0.23% for K9C and 0.21% for K9BP) and menaquinones and phylloquinones (forms of vitamin K; 0.23% for K9C; 0.31% for K9BP). Both groups were also enriched in sequences associated with the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NADP (0.58% for K9C; 0.62% for K9BP), both of which function as hydride acceptors and are important in biochemical redox reactions.Genes related to microbial DNA and RNA metabolism were not different between dietary treatments (K9C vs K9BP). Nucleotide metabolism comprised ∼4% of the ‘core' metagenomic genes classified by Turnbaugh et al. (2009). In the present study, this value is similar to that noted for RNA metabolism and DNA metabolism. Given that the values were not different between metagenomic samples, it would be reasonable to expect that the microbiota are replicating at the same rate in each microbiome. In fact, DNA replication comprises the largest percentage of genes identified for DNA metabolism (2.12% for K9C; 2.20% for K9BP). Further, the genes associated with bacterial RNA polymerase were similar between groups (0.56% for K9C; 0.62% for K9BP).Of those pertaining to virulence, there were a wide variety of genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds. A high sequence number for multidrug efflux pumps was noted in both groups, with a numerically greater prevalence in K9C (1.65%) as compared with K9BP (1.51%). In Gram-negative bacteria, these pumps provide protection by actively exporting antimicrobial substances, and serve as one mechanism by which these bacteria can survive in the presence of antibiotics (Poole, 2005). Several classes of multidrug efflux pumps exist, but all have great relevance to bacterial physiology, including antibiotic resistance, and are common drug targets (Vila and Martinez, 2008). This class of genes will continue to have great application not only in canine health but also in that of humans as well, and is an area that deserves more attention in the future. Other resistance-related genes having the greatest sequence number were those associated with acriflavine (0.35% for K9C; 0.38% for K9BP), cobalt-zinc-cadmium (0.52% for K9C; 0.53% for K9BP) and fluoroquinolones (0.50% for K9C; 0.47% for K9BP). Acriflavine is a common antiseptic agent and its resistance is thought to be due to an overexpression of efflux pump genes. The broad-spectrum antibiotics fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and enrofloxacin, are commonly used in human and canine medicine, respectively. Sequences pertaining to Ton and Tol transport systems were also highly prevalent in both groups (1.01% for K9C; 0.97% for K9BP). The Ton system is an energy transducer and uses the transmembrane electrochemical gradient for nutrient uptake, whereas the Tol system is energy independent and seems to preserve the cellular envelope (Muller et al., 1993). These transport systems are involved in the uptake of numerous nutrients (for example, vitamin B12; iron), and also serve as a mechanism by which bacteriocins translocate into and kill competing bacteria (Alonso et al., 2000). Finally, a few sequences for genes associated with iron scavenging were present, but very few pertained to adhesion or invasion mechanisms. Genes most prevalent in the cell wall and capsule subsystem were associated with biosynthesis of peptidoglycan (1.35% for K9C; 1.13% for K9BP), KDO2-Lipid A (0.65% for K9C; 0.63% for K9BP) and LOS core oligosaccharides (0.45% for K9C and K9BP). Rhamnose containing glycans (0.34% for K9C; 0.33% for K9BP) and sialic acid metabolism (0.73% for K9C; 0.69% for K9BP) also had a high prevalence.To get a more in-depth view of the carbohydrate-related enzymes present in our data set, we subjected our samples to the carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org) as described by Cantarel et al. (2009). K9C seemed to be enriched with glycoside hydrolases, glycosyl-transferases (765 vs 560 sequences), carbohydrate-binding modules (236 vs 140 sequences), carbohydrate esterases (236 vs 140 sequences) and polysaccharide lyases (101 vs 53 sequences) (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). This response was counterintuitive to our hypothesis that beet pulp would increase carbohydrate-related enzymes and requires greater focus in the future. Nevertheless, although total sequence number was different between samples, the percentage of each gene within its gene family was similar for each. Even though the fiber concentration of the dog diet is rather low, cellulosomes would be expected to have a predominant role in cellulosic and hemicellulosic catabolism, as noted in other species. To our knowledge, the cellulosomes present in canine gut microbiota have not been studied thus far and would be a worthy focus in future studies.The double hierarchical dendogram used to cluster metagenomes on the basis of metabolic capacity (Figure 2) demonstrates that canine and human samples were clustered together according to the host system, with chicken cecum and mice samples being least similar to dogs. Because this experiment used a crossover design in a research setting, dogs and housing environment were constant, leaving diet as the only difference between samples. Thus, it may not be surprising that the prevalence of each functional group was very similar between the two canine samples. The heat map also demonstrates that the canine metagenome clustered most closely with the two human metagenomes, followed by the chicken cecum metagenome. The two mouse samples clustered together and were most different than canine samples. Interestingly, mouse samples had an enrichment of genes associated with phosphorus metabolism as compared with the other metagenomes. The chicken metagenome had a greater sequence number associated with sulfur metabolism, and fewer sequences associated with fatty acids and lipids, cell division and cell cycle and motility and chemotaxis.To conclude, we present here the first metagenomics data set, including phylogeny and functional capacity, of the canine gastrointestinal microbiome. Our data demonstrate that the dominant bacterial phyla of the gut microbiome (for example, Bacteroidetes; Firmicutes) are similar to those of humans and rodent models. Archaea, fungi and viral sequences represented a minor portion of all sequences, but were present at levels similar to that of other mammalian biomes. Primary functional categories were also similar to those of other mammalian gut microbiomes and were associated with carbohydrates; protein, DNA and RNA metabolism; vitamin and cell-wall component biosynthesis; and virulence. Hierarchical clustering of gut metagenomic data from dogs, humans and mice demonstrated high phylogenetic and metabolic similarity among species. Although some alterations due to the inclusion of dietary fiber were noted, more drastic dietary changes (for example, source, type, or amount of macronutrients, including protein and dietary fiber) are likely needed to result in large effects in the canine gut metagenome. Although this experiment has provided a brief overview of the canine gut community, future studies are required to provide a deeper coverage and greater characterization of the metagenome of dogs in healthy and diseased states, of varying ages or genetic backgrounds, and/or receiving specific dietary interventions.We thank Brandi Cantarel for her assistance with interpretation of the CAZy data.The authors declare no conflict of interest.Supplementary Information accompanies the paper on The ISME Journal website (http://www.nature.com/ismej)Supplementary Information accompanies the paper on The ISME Journal website (http://www.nature.com/ismej)"

They are obligate biotrophs, which extract nutrients only from living plant tissues and cannot grow apart from their hosts. Their lifestyle has slowed the dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying host invasion and avoidance or suppression of plant innate immunity. We sequenced the 101-Mb genome of Melampsora larici-populina, the causal agent of poplar leaf rust, and the 89-Mb genome of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat and barley stem rust. We then compared the 16,399 predicted proteins of M. larici-populina with the 17,773 predicted proteins of P. graminis f. sp tritici. Genomic features related to their obligate biotrophic lifestyle include expanded lineage-specific gene families, a large repertoire of effector-like small secreted proteins, impaired nitrogen and sulfur assimilation pathways, and expanded families of amino acid and oligopeptide membrane transporters. The dramatic up-regulation of transcripts coding for small secreted proteins, secreted hydrolytic enzymes, and transporters in planta suggests that they play a role in host infection and nutrient acquisition. Some of these genomic hallmarks are mirrored in the genomes of other microbial eukaryotes that have independently evolved to infect plants, indicating convergent adaptation to a biotrophic existence inside plant cells.Rust fungi (Pucciniales, Basidiomycota) are a diverse group of plant pathogens composed of more than 120 genera and 6,000 species, and are one of the most economically important groups of pathogens of native and cultivated plants (1, 2). Puccinia graminis, the causal agent of stem rust, has caused devastating epidemics wherever wheat is grown (3), and a new highly virulent strain (Ug99) threatens wheat production worldwide (4). Similarly, epidemics of poplar leaf rust, caused by Melampsora spp., is a major constraint on the development of bioenergy programs based on domesticated poplars (5) as a result of the lack of durable host resistance (6, 7). Rust fungi are obligate biotrophic parasites with a complex life cycle that often includes two phylogeneticaly unrelated hosts (2). They have evolved specialized structures, haustoria, formed within host tissue to efficiently acquire nutrients and suppress host defense responses (8). Molecular features driving adaptations to an obligate biotrophic association with plant hosts are unknown. Whether the convergent biotrophic adaptation observed in bacterial parasites (9) and other lineages of microbial eukaryotes (e.g., microsporidia) (10) has led to functional specializations at the genome level (i.e., gene gain or loss, regulation of gene expression) remains to be determined. The recent report of the genome sequence of Blumeria graminis, an ascomycete biotroph pathogen responsible for barley powdery mildew, revealed a genome size expansion caused by transposon proliferation concomitant with dramatic reduction in gene content, i.e., genes encoding sugar-cleaving enzymes, transporters and assimilatory enzymes for inorganic nitrate and sulfur (11). Similarly, gene losses were observed in the genome of the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, a biotroph parasite infecting Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as the diversification of genes encoding RXLR effector-like secreted proteins (12). Despite their phylogenetic distance, these two pathogens forming haustoria seem to share striking adaptation convergences to biotrophy. To determine the genetic features underlying pathogenesis and biotrophic ability of rust pathogens, we report here the genome sequences of the rust fungi Melampsora larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici.We have sequenced the dikaryotic genomes of the poplar leaf rust fungus, M. larici-populina, and of the wheat stem rust fungus, P. graminis f. sp. tritici, by a Sanger whole-genome shotgun strategy (SI Text, Genome Sequencing and Assembly). The overall assembly sizes of the haploid genomes of M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici are 101.1 Mb and 88.6 Mb, respectively (Table 1). These genomes are much larger than the other sequenced basidiomycete genomes (13, 14), but no evidence for whole-genome duplication or large-scale dispersed segmental duplications was observed. The expanded size results from a massive proliferation of transposable elements (TEs), which account for nearly 45% of both assembled genomes (Figs. S1 and S2 and Dataset S1, Tables S3 and S4). Class I LTR retroelements are more abundant in P. graminis f. sp. tritici, whereas class II terminal inverted repeat (TIR) DNA transposons are prominent in M. larici-populina. Timing of TE activity by using sequence divergence of extant copies suggests that a major wave of retrotransposition in the M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici lineages occurred more than 1 Mya (SI Text, Repeat Analysis).Assembly statistics for the dikaryotic genome of M. larici-populina (Mlp) 98AG31 and P. graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) CDL75-36–700-3, race SCCL*Statistics for Mlp are based on the ”main genome scaffolds” of the assembly; the ”repetitive,” “excluded,” and ”altHaplotype” scaffolds for Mlp (Dataset S1, Table S2) were not included.†The N50 metric corresponds to the N largest scaffolds required to capture half of the total sequence. The N50 length is that of the smallest scaffold in the N50 set.We predicted 16,399 and 17,773 protein-coding genes in M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici, respectively. The size of these proteomes is similar to the symbiotic basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor (14), but strikingly larger than the corn smut fungi Ustilago maydis and Sporisorium reilianum, two nonobligate pathogenic biotrophs that encode only approximately 6,500 proteins (15, 16). Among the predicted proteins, only 41% and 35% in M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici, respectively, showed significant sequence similarity to documented proteins (BLASTP E-value ≤ 10−5; SI Text, Gene Prediction and Annotation and Fig. S3). To investigate protein evolution in M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici, we constructed families containing both orthologues and paralogues from a diverse set of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous fungi (SI Text, Multigene Families and Evolutionary Analysis of Multigene Families). The two genomes shared 3,984 orthologous Tribe-MCL families, which comprised 7,959 P. graminis f. sp. tritici genes and 7,875 M. larici-populina genes; 26% of the predicted protein families were lineage-specific, whereas 774 gene families were unique to these two rust fungi. Expansion of protein family sizes was prominent in both M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici (Fig. 1, Fig. S4, and Dataset S1, Tables S6–S8); several expanded protein families are lineage-specific, suggesting that important protein-coding innovation occurred in these lineages. Of the 5,045 M. larici-populina genes that have an orthologue in P. graminis f. sp. tritici (best reciprocal BLASTP hit, E-value ≤ 10−5), very few showed conservation of neighboring orthologues, suggesting there is little synteny between the genomes (SI Text, Lack of Genome Duplication and Synteny Between M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici, and Fig. S5). This is likely because of the expansion of the TE and massive reshuffling of the genomes as a result of recombination between TEs. In addition, within the rust fungi, M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici represent very divergent phylogenetic lineages (1). Gene family expansions also occurred in those genes coding for oligopeptide membrane transporters (OPTs; Dataset S1, Table S18), copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD; Dataset S1, Table S23), different types of glycosyl hydrolases, lipases, and peptidases, and several groups of predicted signaling genes, including kinases and transcription factors (Figs. S4 and S6–S8). Several gene families encoding leucine-rich repeat domain-containing proteins were expanded (Fig. S4A), and are potentially involved in protein–protein interactions in rust fungi. Different types of helicases are also represented in expanded gene families of rust fungi and could allow for an increased capability for DNA maintenance and repair. Strikingly, both rust fungi have expanded lineage-specific gene families encoding zinc-finger proteins (Fig. S4B), with significantly overrepresented nucleic acid binding and zinc ion binding gene ontology terms in both genes sets, which represent potential transcription factors (SI Text, Multigene Families and Evolutionary Analysis of Multigene Families, and Dataset S1, Tables S7 and S8). These results suggest that rust fungi possess a diverse potential to regulate and repair nucleic acid; targeted work will be required to decipher the roles of these proteins during the interaction with plant hosts. Although proliferation of TEs might have contributed to the expansion of gene families in rust fungi, no specific localization of particular gene families was identified in TE-rich regions of rust genomes, such as reported for effectors in other plant pathogens (17,18, 19) (SI Text, Multigene Families and Evolutionary Analysis of Multigene Families).Predicted pattern of gene families gain and loss in representative fungal genomes. The figure represents the total number of protein families in each species or node estimated by Dollo parsimony principle. The numbers on the branches of the phylogenetic tree correspond to expanded (Left, black), contracted (Right, red), or inferred ancestral (oval) protein families along each lineage by comparison with the putative pan-proteome. For each species, the number of gene families, orphan genes, and the total gene number are indicated on the right.Seventy and 54% of the predicted genes of M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici, respectively, were detected by custom microarray transcript profiling of resting and germinating urediniospores, as well as infected leaves (SI Text, Whole-Genome Exon Oligoarrays). A significant proportion of the detected transcripts (18%) is differentially expressed (fold ratio ≥ 10.0; P < 0.05) in infected leaves, whereas only approximately 8.0% are specifically expressed in planta (SI Text, Whole-Genome Exon Oligoarrays). Transcripts coding for secreted peptidases and lipases, transporters of hexoses, amino acids, and oligopeptides, and carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes, such as chitin deacetylases and cutinases (Tables 2 and ​and33 and Dataset S1, Tables S12 and S16), are strikingly enriched (≥10-fold) in planta. However, the most highly up-regulated transcripts in planta (≥100-fold) are mainly comprised of lineage-specific transcripts, including those coding for small secreted proteins (SSPs; Fig. 2 and Dataset S1, Tables S10 and S14). These in planta-induced, lineage-specific genes are likely involved in the specific relationship established between these rust fungi and their respective hosts.Selection of M. larici-populina (Mlp) genes strongly up-regulated during poplar leaf infectionUp-regulation in poplar infected leaves is assessed by comparing transcripts profiles to those from resting urediniospores. Poplar leaves were infected by M. larici-populina urediniospores and left for 96 hours postinoculation (hpi) under controlled conditions. At this stage, poplar rust pathogen has formed many haustoria in planta and sporulation has not yet occurred. Expression values are the means of three biological replicates for 96 hpi and urediniospores. Based on statistical analysis of normalized fluorescence levels, a gene was considered significantly regulated if it met two criteria (1): t test P value, 0.05 (ArrayStar; DNAStar); infected poplar leaves at 96 hpi versus urediniospores fold change > 10. Genes were selected on the basis of homology to a function, and hypothetical proteins or genes without homology of unknown function (exception of SSPs homologues of candidate rust pathogen effectors) were discarded. The complete list of significantly regulated genes is detailed in Dataset S1, Table S12.*Below background expression level.Selection of P. graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) genes strongly up-regulated during wheat infectionUp-regulation in infected wheat is assessed by comparing transcripts profiles to those from resting urediniospores. Wheat leaves were infected by P. graminis f. sp. tritici urediniospores and left for 8 d after inoculation under controled conditions. At this stage, wheat rust pathogen has started to sporulate and macroscopic flecking are visible. Expression values are the means of three biological replicates for 8 dpi and urediniospores. Based on statistical analysis of normalized fluorescence levels, a gene was considered significantly regulated if it met two criteria (1): t test P value, 0.05 (using mattes in Matlab); infected wheat at 8 dpi versus urediniospores fold-change > 10. Genes were selected on the basis of homology to a function, and hypothetical proteins or genes without homology of unknown function were discarded. The complete list of significantly regulated genes is detailed in Dataset S1, Table S16.*Below background expression level.Expression profiling of candidate rust effector genes.

Gray circles, significantly in planta-induced genes; red circles, SSP encoding genes.Microbial pathogens have evolved highly advanced mechanisms to engage their hosts in intimate contact and sabotage host immune responses by secreting effector proteins into host cells to target regulators of defense (20–22). Most SSPs that are specifically produced during plant infection are likely to be effectors that manipulate host cells to facilitate parasitic colonization, such as by suppressing plant innate immunity or enhancing nutrient availability (21). In silico gene prediction and manual annotation of SSP genes in M. larici-populina genome identified a set of 1,184 SSPs (SI Text, Effector/Secretome, and Dataset S1, Table S17), of which 74% are lineage-specific. P. graminis f. sp. tritici contains a similar number of 1,106 SSP genes, of which 84% are lineage-specific. In M. larici-populina, a total of 812 SSPs are organized in 169 families of two to 111 members (Dataset S1, Table S17); the largest family contains a highly conserved 10-cysteine pattern (Fig. S6A). In P. graminis f. sp. tritici, a total of 593 SSPs are organized in 164 families of two to 44 members and the largest family contains a highly conserved eight-cysteine pattern (Fig. S6B). Four of these proteins show evidence of haustorial expression in wheat rust, providing additional evidence that they are potentially effectors. This expansion of SSP genes in rust fungi is striking as SSP families account for approximately 10% of the expanded families in both rust genomes. Between 50% and 56% of the lineage-specific SSP genes are supported by ESTs or expression detected on the custom oligoarrays, which provide evidence to support these predicted genes of unknown function; additional genes could be specifically expressed during the sexual phase of the lifecycle (23), which was not explored here. Both M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici require an alternate host to complete their lifecycle and achieve sexual reproduction, and successful infection of the alternate host may involve a different set of SSP genes. Homologues of known effectors from Melampsora lini, such as haustorially expressed secreted proteins (HESPs) and the avirulence factors AvrM, AvrL567, AvrP123, and AvrP4 from the flax rust fungus M. lini (8, 21), and the rust-transferred protein RTP1 from the bean rust pathogen (22), are present among highly up-regulated M. larici-populina transcripts (Table 2 and Dataset S1, Tables S10–S12). Interestingly, whereas 19 of the 21 M. lini HESPs (24) showed significant similarity to M. larici-populina SSP genes (BLASTP E-value ≤ 10−5), only nine showed similarity to P. graminis f. sp. tritici SSP genes, suggesting the presence of effector genes conserved in the Melampsoraceae and not shared within the Pucciniales order. By contrast, homologues of Uromyces fabae RTP1 were detected in the poplar and the wheat rust genomes—three and seven, respectively—indicating the presence of conserved effectors families in the Pucciniales. Recently, [Y/F/W]xC motifs were reported in the N-terminal region of secreted proteins in the ascomycete B. graminis, an obligate biotroph of wheat, as well as in Puccinia spp. (25). Systematic search for these motifs in the poplar leaf and the wheat stem rust fungi showed that they were indeed abundant in SSPs but not restricted to the N-terminal region as in B. graminis (Fig. S6A; SI Text, Effector/Secretome). These motifs were also present in nonsecreted proteins related to zinc binding and nucleic acid binding (SI Text, Effector/Secretome), suggesting these motifs are also conserved in other cysteine-rich proteins. At least 43% of M. larici-populina and 40% of P. graminis f. sp. tritici SSPs are expressed in infected leaves. In P. graminis f. sp. tritici, PGTG_17547 matches the highest number of haustorial ESTs, and is similar in sequence to a predicted secreted protein ({""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ADA54575"",""term_id"":""281185566"",""term_text"":""ADA54575""}}ADA54575) from the wheat stripe rust fungus, Puccinia striiformis (25); this protein is lineage-specific, sharing no significant similarity with proteins outside the Pucciniales. In both rust species, one highly in planta-expressed SSP [PGTG_13212, Joint Genome Institute (JGI) ID no. 85525] is similar in sequence to HESP-735 from the flax rust pathogen (24) (Dataset S1, Tables S12 and S14). SSPs are highly overrepresented in the mostly highly induced genes; 50 and 29 SSPs belong to the top 100 most highly transcriptionally up-regulated in infected poplar and wheat leaves compared with M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici urediniospores, respectively (Fig. 2 and Dataset S1, Tables S10 and S14). Most up-regulated SSP transcripts in planta were lineage-specific, as only 16% have an orthologue in both rust species, suggesting that these sequences are evolving at a very high rate. The specific location remains to be determined, whether up-regulated SSPs are expressed in infection hyphae and/or haustoria, and whether they remain in the cell wall or extrahaustorial matrix or are adressed to specific compartments of the host cell where they interact with their target proteins as shown for avirulence proteins in M. lini (8, 21). Similarly, some of the predicted SSP genes not expressed in urediniospores or in planta could act as specialized effectors during infection of the alternate host.Gene families encoding host-targeted, hydrolytic enzymes acting on plant biopolymers, such as proteinases, lipases, and several sugar-cleaving enzymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes; CAZymes) (26), are highly up-regulated in both rust pathogen transcriptomes in planta (Tables 2 and ​and33 and Dataset S1, Tables S12 and S16), suggesting that the invading hypha is penetrating the host cells by using these degrading enzymes. The comparison of the glycoside hydrolase (GH), glycosyltransferases (GTs), polysaccharide lyase (PL), and carbohydrate esterase (CE) of 21 sequenced fungi (Fig. S8) revealed that M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici have a relatively smaller set of GH-encoding genes (173 and 158 members, respectively; SI Text, Annotation of Putative CAZymes, and Dataset S1, Table S19); this content is similar to that in the basidiomycete symbiont L. bicolor (14), but much fewer than in hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic phytopathogens (e.g., Magnaporthe oryzae) and saprotrophs (including Neurospora crassa; Coprinopsis cinerea; Schizophyllum commune) (27). This set of CAZymes is strikingly larger than the repertoire of the biotroph U. maydis (100 members) (15). In evolving a biotrophic lifestyle, the rust fungi have lost several secreted hydrolytic GH and PL enzymes acting on plant cell wall (PCW) polysaccharides (Fig. S8) and they are lacking the cellulose-binding carbohydrate-binding module 1 (CBM1). However, they show a moderate expansion of a few GHs cleaving plant celluloses and hemicelluloses (e.g., GH7, GH10, GH12, GH26, and GH27) compared with the biotroph U. maydis or the hemibiotroph M. oryzae. These enzymes, together with in planta up-regulated and expanded α-mannosidase (GH47) and β-1,3-glucanase (GH5) transcripts (Dataset S1, Tables S12 and S16), may play a key role in the initial stages of host colonization, i.e., penetration of the parenchyma cells. A different set of enzymes, induced chitin deacetylases (CE4) present in P. graminis f. sp. tritici, M. larici-populina, and the symbiont L. bicolor (14), are likely involved in fungal cell wall remodeling and may play a role in the alteration of the fungal cell wall surface during infection to conceal invading hypha from the host (28).Acquisition of nutrients, including carbohydrates and amino acids, is crucial to the success of rust pathogen biotrophic interactions established by invading hyphae forming haustoria within the host plant (21, 29, 30). The repertoire of membrane transporters (SI Text, Transporters, and Dataset S1, Table S18) in M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici contains homologues of the hexose transporter HXT1, amino acid transporters AAT1, AAT2, and AAT3, and H+-ATPases from the bean rust pathogen (U. fabae), known to be highly up-regulated during the interaction with its host plant. In addition, M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici genomes display an increased genetic potential for peptide uptake with 22 and 21 OPT genes, respectively, whereas other basidiomycete genomes contain only five to 16 OPT genes (Dataset S1, Table S18). OPT genes that are transcriptionally up-regulated in planta (Dataset S1, Tables S12 and S16), are likely involved in the transport of peptides released by the action of the induced proteinases (aspartic peptidase, subtilisin) expressed in infected leaf tissues. The Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) gene family is reduced in the M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici genomes compared with other basidiomycetes (Dataset S1, Table S18), but many MFS transcripts are, however, highly expressed in planta including two HXT1 homologues. Consistent with in planta expression of M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici invertase genes (Dataset S1, Tables S12 and S16), no homologue of the sucrose transporter Srt1 recently described in U. maydis (29) was identified, supporting the preferential uptake of host hexoses by invading rust pathogen hyphae (30). The increased activity of membrane transporters provides the needed fuel for the high primary metabolism activity observed in the invading rust fungi (Dataset S1, Tables S12 and S16). Strikingly, both rust fungi showed expansion of genes encoding auxin efflux carriers compared with other basidiomycetes (SI Text, Transporters), several of which are strongly expressed during plant infection. In addition, homologues of U. maydis auxin synthesis genes are also expressed during host infection. The potential for synthesis of auxin-like compounds that could regulate plant growth or development, as well as the expansion of strongly expressed auxin efflux carriers in rust fungi, suggests that fungal auxins could affect host hormone signaling and defense response or PCW integrity during rust infection.Based on the inability of rust fungi to grow in vitro, we hypothesized that the M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici genomes may lack genes typically present in saprotrophic basidiomycetes. Major anabolic pathways of primary metabolism were manually inspected for potential deficiencies. Although the enzymes of the NH4+ assimilation pathway were identified, several genes involved in nitrate assimilation were lacking in both rust pathogen genomes; the nitrate/nitrite porter and the nitrite reductase are missing from the nitrate assimilation gene cluster found in other fungi (31). Loss of another pathway was specific to one of the genomes; genes required to perform the primary sulfate assimilation were identified in M. larici-populina whereas they were not found in P. graminis f. sp. tritici. The latter fungus lacks both α- and β-subunits of sulfite reductase (SiR), whereas the M. larici-populina β-subunit of SiR is missing the transketolase domain present in other fungal SiRs. The apparent incapacitation of nitrate and sulfate assimilation pathways in both rust fungi is consistent with their obligate biotrophic lifestyle, as they depend on reduced nitrogen (NH4+ or amino acids) and sulfur from plant cells. These metabolic deficiencies have also been found in other plant pathogens that represent two independent evolutionary lineages of obligate biotrophy in the oomycete (H. arabidopsidis) and ascomycete (B. graminis) lineages (11, 12).Little is known about how obligate biotrophic rust fungi invade their hosts and avoid or suppress defense responses. The genome sequences of the poplar leaf and wheat stem rust fungi provide an unparalleled opportunity to address questions related to the obligate biotrophic lifestyle. The genetic changes that brought about the evolution of obligate biotrophy from nonbiotrophic progenitors remain obscure. Our comparisons of M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici to other saprotrophic, pathogenic, and symbiotic basidiomycetes indicate that developmental innovations in the rust fungi lineages did not involve major changes in the ancestral repertoire of conserved proteins with known function. However, gene family expansions observed for OPT, auxin efflux carriers, SOD, and signaling elements could reflect specific adaptations to this extreme parasitic lifestyle of these fungi. Similarly, lineage-specific gene families encoding zinc finger proteins, which may act as transcription factors during plant–rust interactions, suggest that these allow for different transcriptional programs in the two fungi. Analysis of these genomes revealed that the largest innovation of gene content encompasses the large set of lineage-specific, expanding gene families, which may enable developmental innovation and adaptation. Further, our analysis shows that the colonization of the host leaf, differentiation of pathogenic structures, and control of the plant immune system can be associated with a large-scale invention of lineage-specific proteins. For example, the rich repertoire of candidate effector-like SSPs could underlie the coevolution and adaptation of these obligate pathogens to the plant immune system. In contrast to obligate bacterial biotrophs and microsporidial fungal parasites, which frequently undergo gene loss and genome compaction (9, 10), the rust pathogen genomes are among the largest fungal genomes sequenced so far, as a result of expanded gene families and massive proliferation of TEs. No large-scale gene loss was observed in M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici, but some losses of clear impact, including the deletion of genes apparently not essential for the obligate biotrophic lifestyle (nitrate and sulfur assimilation), and a reduced set of PCW polysaccharide degrading enzymes, are genomic hallmarks of rust fungi, and, more broadly, of biotrophic pathogens as a group (11, 12). A deeper understanding of the complex array of the factors, including effector-like SSPs, affecting host–pathogen interactions and coevolution could enable efficient targeting of parasite-control methods in agricultural and forest ecosystems.The dikaryotic M. larici-populina 98AG31 and P. graminis f. sp. tritici CDL 75–36-700–3 (race SCCL) strains (SI Text, Background Information) were sequenced by whole-genome sequencing and were assembled into predicted 101.1-Mb and 88.6-Mb genomes, respectively (SI Text, Genome Sequencing and Assembly). The protein-coding genes were predicted with a combination of automated gene callers, ESTs produced from each rust fungus, and filtering dubious genes with similarity to TEs (SI Text, Gene Prediction and Annotation). In total, the gene sets included 16,399 and 17,773 predicted genes for M. larici-populina and P. graminis f. sp. tritici, respectively; these were the basis for multigene family analyses.

PMC3111232,Draft Genome Sequencing and Comparative Analysis of Aspergillus sojae NBRC4239,False,"We conducted genome sequencing of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus sojae NBRC4239 isolated from the koji used to prepare Japanese soy sauce. We used the 454 pyrosequencing technology and investigated the genome with respect to enzymes and secondary metabolites in comparison with other Aspergilli sequenced. Assembly of 454 reads generated a non-redundant sequence of 39.5-Mb possessing 13 033 putative genes and 65 scaffolds composed of 557 contigs. Of the 2847 open reading frames with Pfam domain scores of >150 found in A. sojae NBRC4239, 81.7% had a high degree of similarity with the genes of A. oryzae. Comparative analysis identified serine carboxypeptidase and aspartic protease genes unique to A. sojae NBRC4239. While A. oryzae possessed three copies of α-amyalse gene, A. sojae NBRC4239 possessed only a single copy. Comparison of 56 gene clusters for secondary metabolites between A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. oryzae revealed that 24 clusters were conserved, whereas 32 clusters differed between them that included a deletion of 18 508 bp containing mfs1, mao1, dmaT, and pks-nrps for the cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) biosynthesis, explaining the no productivity of CPA in A. sojae. The A. sojae NBRC4239 genome data will be useful to characterize functional features of the koji moulds used in Japanese industries.Koji moulds are widely used in the production of traditional fermented foods and beverages such as Japanese miso, soy sauce, and sake. Two typical koji moulds, Aspergillus sojae and A. oryzae, are used. During the fermentation process, koji moulds act by breaking down the ingredients. Each species of koji moulds reacts differently to the ingredients used and must therefore be selected based on the desired product. For example, A. sojae is selected to produce miso and soy sauce due to its high proteolytic ability, and A. oryzae is used widely in sake, miso, and soy sauce production for its high amylolytic ability. Among Aspergillus strains deposited in the RIKEN Bioresource Center Japan Collection of Microorganisms (http://www.jcm.riken.jp/JCM/JCM_DB.shtm), 15 strains out of 53 in A. oryzae strains were derived from sake koji, 6 from miso, and 17 from soy sauce koji, while 16 strains out of 20 strains of A. sojae were derived from soy sauce koji.For taxonomic classification of Aspergillus species, molecular strategies have been developed to discriminate several Aspergillus species.1 Aspergillus oryzae and A. sojae are classified in the Aspergillus section Flavi, which also includes plant pathogen A. flavus and A. parasiticus that produces aflatoxins known to be carcinogenic substances. The analysis based on restriction-site polymorphisms of genes coding for 11 proteins and sequences of five of those genes suggested that A. oryzae is a species derived from A. flavus through human handling.2 From a viewpoint of evolutionarily close relation of A. oryzae and A. sojae with pathogenic Aspergillus species, it is vital to distinguish between aflatoxin productive and non-productive moulds and to select the latter for industrial use. It has been reported that A. oryzae does not produce these substances from expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis of A. oryzae RIB40, in which many of the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusters were found to be unexpressed.3 For A. sojae, a termination point mutation in aflR which controls transcription of aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusters and lack of the polyketide synthase (PKS) gene are correlated with its aflatoxin non-productivity.4The genome of A. oryzae RIB40 was recently completely sequenced and the comprehensive analysis showed that this strain possesses 134 protease genes including many paralogous genes and multiple copies of α-amylase and α-glucosidase genes.5 These genetic features may account for its high proteolytic and amylolytic abilities in A. oryzae RIB40.Many of the moulds classified in Aspergillus section Flavi are known to produce various secondary metabolites. The A. oryzae RIB40 genome encodes genes for numerous secondary metabolites other than aflatoxins,6 although EST and microarray analysis of A. oryzae RIB40 suggested that it has almost no productivity of secondary metabolites.7 These features of A. oryzae on the basis of quality, productivity, and safety may be one of the reasons for that A. oryzae strains have gradually been selected as industrially useful strains.8Though similar studies in A. sojae have not been conducted so much as A. oryzae, it is thought to be a domesticated strain selectively bred from natural strains as well as A. oryzae above.However, the whole genetic information of A. sojae is insufficient to investigate the functional features important for its industrial use including the protease and amylase activities as well as safety. Therefore, we conducted the whole-genome sequencing of the practical strain A. sojae NBRC4239 isolated from Japanese soy sauce koji by using the next generation sequencer 454 pyrosequencer. The genetic information of A. sojae NBRC4239, combined with that of A. oryzae, will synergistically provide the knowledge for deep understanding of the biological nature of industrially important koji mould and for its further development of usefulness in food science field.Aspergillus sojae NBRC4239 was obtained from NBRC (http://www.nbrc.nite.go.jp/). This strain is a practical strain isolated from Japanese soy sauce koji.Aspergillus sojae NBRC4239 was incubated in PD liquid media (1% peptone, 2% dextrin, 0.5% KH2PO4, 0.1% NaNO3, 0.05% MgSO4, and 0.1% casamino acids, pH 6.0) on a shaker at 150 rpm at 30°C for 24 h. After collection on a mortar, mould was frozen in liquid nitrogen and then crushed with a pestle. The genome was extracted from this mould using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corporation, USA) and purified using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (QIAGEN Sciences, USA), according to the respective manufacturer's protocols.For GS FLX Titanium fragment sequencing, 500 ng of genomic DNA was sheared into DNA fragments ranging from 300 to 800 bp by nebulization. After both ends of the DNA fragments were repaired and phosphorylated, two types of adaptors (A and B) were ligated to the DNA fragments. Next, the DNA fragments carrying the 5′-biotin of adaptor B from the ligation mixture were immobilized onto magnetic streptavidin-coated beads. The single-stranded template DNA (ssDNA) molecules carrying Adaptor A at 5′-end and Adaptor B at 3′-end were isolated by alkaline denaturation. These purified ssDNAs were then hybridized to DNA capture beads and clonally amplified by an emulsion polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. After denaturation of the amplified double-stranded DNAs on the capture beads, these beads with single-stranded molecules were spread onto each well of a pico titre plate. For GS FLX Titanium Paired-end sequencing, 15 μg of genomic DNA was sheared into DNA fragments ranging from ∼8 kb by fragmentation. After the ends of the DNA fragments were repaired and internal adaptors were ligated to the DNA fragments, each DNA fragment was circularized and self-ligated. The circular DNA was sheared into DNA fragments ranging from 300 to 800 bp by nebulization. The DNA fragments carrying the 5′-biotin of internal adaptor from the ligation mixture were immobilized onto magnetic streptavidin-coated beads. Paired-end sequencing was carried out similar to the method described above. Two sequencing runs in total were carried out. The GS FLX sequence data were assembled using Newbler assembly software.GlimmerHMM,9 AUGUSTUS,10,11 SNAP,12 and GeneMark + ES13 were used as ab initio predictors, and Genewise14 was used as the evidence-based predictor. The ab initio GlimmerHMM, AUGUSTUS, and SNAP parameters were trained on all A. oryzae RIB40 gene models, while GeneMark + ES performed an iterative self-training procedure. The amino acid sequence of A. oryzae RIB40 was used for alignment by Genewise. GFF files obtained from these prediction programmes were incorporated by Evigan15 to produce prediction results. Out of the predicted open reading frames (ORFs), those with more than 100 amino acid residues were selected as predictor genes.Amino acid sequences of the predictor genes were matched with non-redundant protein database (nr, NCBI) by BLAST16 and were annotated based on identity. tRNA were predicted by tRNAscan-SE.17Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of A. oryzae RIB40 were obtained from DOGAN (http://www.nbrc.nite.go.jp/dogan/). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of A. flavus NRRL3357, A. fumigatus Af293, and A. nidulans FGSC A4 were obtained from the Aspergillus Genome Database (AspGD).18 Putative domains were predicted with the HMMER19 programme hmmscan using the hidden Markov models from the pfam database.20 For A. oryzae RIB40, A. flavus NRRL3357, A. fumigatus Af293, and A. nidulans FGSC A4, ORFs with Pfam domain scores of >150 were subject to comparison.A domain list for protease was created by matching amino acid sequences registered in MEROPS21 with the HMMER from the Pfam database. Based on this list, amino acid sequences with protease domain scores >150 were compared between A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. oryzae RIB40. For phylogenetic analysis, multiple alignments were carried out by ClustalX22 and phylogenic trees were drawn with TreeView.23It is known that out of the glycoside hydrolases, families 13, 15, and 31 are involved in amylolysis. Entries of glycoside hydrolase belonging to these three families in relation to A. oryzae RIB40 were extracted from the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme (CAZy) database.24 From these data, amylolytic enzymes possessed by A. sojae NBRC4239 strains were predicted. Furthermore, for these predicted amylolytic enzymes, checks were made to confirm the presence of active centre residues (data not shown). Alignment of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were carried out by GENETYX, and BLAST was used for homology searches. PCR primer sequences used for partial nucleotide sequence checks are shown in Supplementary Table S1.Sequences of secondary metabolite gene clusters in A. oryzae RIB40 were obtained from the Secondary Metabolite Unknown Region Finder (SMURF) database.25 Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) biosynthesis gene cluster sequences of A. flavus were obtained from Broad Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/Aspergillus_group) with reference to reports by Chang et al.26 Sequences near the aflatrem gene clusters in A. flavus and A. oryzae were obtained from reports by Nicholson et al.,27 where the sequences for A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. oryzae RIB40 were obtained from Broad Institute and DOGAN, respectively. For A. flavus NRRL6541, sequences ATM1 ({""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AY559849.2"",""term_id"":""161621808"",""term_text"":""AY559849.2""}}AY559849.2 GI:161621808) and ATM2 ({""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AM921700.1"",""term_id"":""162286818"",""term_text"":""AM921700.1""}}AM921700.1 GI:162286818) entered in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) were used. Harr plots were generated by In silico Molecular Cloning Series IMC, genomics edition (In Silico Biology, Inc.). PCR primer sequences used for partial nucleotide sequence checks are shown in Supplementary Table S2.Nucleotide sequence data were entered into the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank DNA databases.

The 65 scaffolds are composed of 557 contigs, thus 477 contigs did not make up scaffolds. Out of the 1034 contigs, 707 were >500 bp. Total length of the contigs and scaffolds each exceeded 39 Mb. As the genome size reported for A. oryzae RIB40 is 37.6 Mb,5 the genome of A. sojae NBRC4239 was predicted to exceed that of A. oryzae RIB40.ORF prediction was carried out on the 65 scaffolds and the 477 contigs that did not make up scaffolds. As a result, we obtained 13 033 ORFs with amino acid residues >100. Also, 275 tRNAs were predicted by tRNAscan-SE. Table 1 showed the comparison of ORFs of A. oryzae RIB40 and A. sojae NBRC4239.
Comparison of ORFs of A. oryzae RIB40 and A. sojae NBRC4239The methods of the sequencing and the ORF prediction procedure were different in A. oryzae and A. sojae, and the value 101, the minimum size, just indicated the artificial value for cutoff.The proportion of ORFs with Pfam domain scores of >150 was 2847/13 033 (21.8%) for A. sojae NBRC4239, 2868/12 074 (23.8%) for A. oryzae RIB40, 2880/12 604 (22.9%) for A. flavus NRRL3357, 2517/9887 (25.5%) for A. fumigatus Af293, and 2641/11 272 (23.4%) for A. nidulans FGSC A4.ORFs with Pfam domain scores of  >150 were compared between A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTP, and it was found that 2326/2847 (81.7%) had >90% identity (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Next, 397/2847 ORFs from A. sojae NBRC4239 were found to have <70% identity with those from A. oryzae RIB40. Of those, 134 ORFs had >90% identity and 192 ORFs had <70% identity in the nucleotide sequence to the corresponding regions in A. oryzae RIB40 by tBLASTN. Therefore, the 134 ORFs found in A. sojae NBRC4239 may have been missed in the gene prediction of A. oryzae RIB40, and the orthologous ORFs to the 192 ORFs may be absent in A. oryzae RIB40. These 192 ORFs in A. sojae NBRC4239 were matched with A. flavus NRRL3357 genes with domain scores >150 using BLASTP. As a result, 22 had >90% identity and 170 had <70% identity. These results indicated that the 22 ORFs are present in both A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. flavus NRRL3357 but absent in A. oryzae RIB40. The 170 ORFs with <70% identity were matched with nr of the NCBI database by BLASTP, and 132 ORFs were found to have <70% identity. Thus, these 132 ORFs may be unique to A. sojae NBRC4239 (Supplementary Fig. S1b).Out of the 2847 ORFs of A. sojae NBRC4239 and 2868 of A. oryzae RIB40, 83 ORFs in A. oryzae RIB40 and 76 in A. sojae NBRC4239 had protease domain scores >150; thus, A. sojae NBRC4239 had seven fewer ORFs. The total number of predicted protease genes in A. oryzae RIB40 was considerably less than the reported 134,5 and this difference is likely due to the strict domain score set at >150.ORFs with domain scores >150 from A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. oryzae RIB40 were sorted and compared by domains. The number of proteases with specific domains was not very different in either species. Four types of proteases in A. sojae NBRC4239 had one more gene than those in A. oryzae RIB40, respectively. Eleven types of proteases in A. sojae NBRC4239 had one gene less than those in A. oryzae RIB40, respectively. In both A. oryzae RIB40 and A. sojae NBRC4239, serine carboxypeptidases were most abundant, followed by aspartic proteases. Aspergillus sojae NBRC4239 had 13 serine carboxypeptidases, which was one more than A. oryzae RIB40, and it had seven aspartic proteases which was two less than A. oryzae RIB40.Under the strict condition of protease domain scores >150, we found no significant difference in the number of protease genes between the two species. However, by using a less strict condition, a difference in the number of protease genes may be observed between A. sojae and A. oryzae.Phylogenic tree for serine carboxypeptidases based on sequences with domain scores >150 was constructed and then compared for A. sojae NBRC4239, A. oryzae RIB40, A. flavus NRRL3357, A. fumigatus Af293, and A. nidulans FGSC A4 (Fig. 1). We found that A. sojae NBRC4239 possesses a serine carboxypeptidase gene (scaffold00048.369) that has low sequence similarity with the other four species. This gene was also included in the 132 ORFs that had <70% identity against nr (refer to the ‘Comparative genomics’ section). The similarity search of scaffold00048.369 against the ORFs of A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTP identified a gene AO090103000026 with the closest match of 56% identity. AO090103000026 was annotated as a serine carboxypeptidase in A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 1). In addition, Scaffold00048.369 was found to have the highest similarity to carboxypeptidase S1 in Neosartorya fischeri NRRL181 with 58% identity by searching against the nr NCBI database by BLASTP. From these results, scaffold00048.369 is likely to be a serine carboxypeptidase unique to A. sojae NBRC4239. We confirmed the expression of scaffold00048.369 by RT–PCR for mRNA isolated from A. sojae NBRC4239 incubated in wheat bran media. The sequencing of the RT–PCR product revealed a sequence identical to the predicted ORF, indicating that our ORF prediction for scaffold00048.36 was correct, and this gene is expressed in wheat bran media (data not shown).
Phylogenic analysis of serine carboxypeptidase in five Aspergillus species. ORFs of serine carboxypeptidase with Pfam domain scores of >150 were analysed by ClustalW and were drawn by TreeView for five Aspergillus species. Filled circles, A. sojae; filled squares, A. oryzae; filled diamonds, A. flavus; triangle, A. nidulans; inverted triangles, A. fumigatus. Blue lines indicate the genes in common with all five Aspergillus species. Green lines indicate the genes in common with three species in Aspergillus section Flavi. Red shows the gene unique to A. sojae. Oranges show extra homologues in A. oryzae reported in Machida et al.6Phylogenic analysis showed that serine carboxypeptidase genes are classified into five clusters that are in common with the five Aspergillus species (C1–5), and seven clusters that are in common only with three species of Aspergillus section Flavi (F1–7). Three of the five common clusters contained serine carboxypeptidase genes that are unique to Aspergillus section Flavi, in addition to the putative orthologous genes. The serine carboxypeptidases unique to A. oryzae RIB40 previously reported6 are therefore considered to be in common with the Aspergillus section Flavi. It is conceivable that A. sojae and A. oryzae have been used widely in miso and soy sauce fermentation because of their possession of highly similar protease genes.Phylogenic tree for aspartic proteases based on sequences with domain scores of >150 was constructed and then compared for A. sojae NBRC4239, A. oryzae RIB40, A. flavus NRRL3357, A. fumigatus Af293, and A. nidulans FGSC A4 (Fig. 2). We found that A. sojae NBRC4239 possesses an aspartic protease gene (scaffold00063.1451) that showed low in sequence similarity with those in the other four species. This gene was also included in the 132 ORFs that had <70% identity against nr (refer to the ‘Comparative genomics’ section). Scaffold00063.1451 was searched against the ORFs of A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTP, and AO090701000002 was found to be the closest gene with 33% identity. AO090701000002 was annotated as an aspartic protease in A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 2). Similarity search of scaffold00063.1451 identified yapsin of Penicillium marneffei ATCC18224 with the highest similarity of 46% identity against the nr NCBI database by BLASTP. From these results, scaffold00063.1451 is likely to be an aspartic protease unique to A. sojae NBRC4239. We confirmed the expression of scaffold00063.1451 by RT–PCR followed by sequencing, as described in the ‘Serine carboxypeptidase' section, indicating that our ORF prediction for scaffold00063.1451 was correct, and this gene is expressed in wheat bran media (data not shown).
Phylogenic analysis of aspartic protease in five Aspergillus species. ORFs of aspartic protease with Pfam domain scores of >150 were analysed by ClustalW and were drawn by TreeView for 5 Aspergillus species. Filled circles, A. sojae; filled squares, A. oryzae; filled diamonds, A. flavus; triangle, A. nidulans; inverted triangles, A. fumigatus. Blue lines indicate the genes in common with all five Aspergillus species. Green line indicates the genes in common with three species in Aspergillus section Flavi. Red shows the gene unique to A. sojae. Oranges show extra homologues in A. oryzae reported in Machida et al.6Phylogenic analysis showed that aspartic protease genes are classified into four clusters that are in common with the five Aspergillus species (C1–4). Only one cluster was in common with only the three species belonging to Aspergillus section Flavi (F1), and other three clusters were shared with two of the three species. These data suggested that aspartic protease genes are less conserved among Aspergillus section Flavi, in contrast to serine carboxypeptidase genes.It is known in general that A. sojae has lower amylolytic activity compared with A. oryzae. We studied the genes for amylolytic enzymes in A. oryzae RIB40 and A. sojae NBRC4239 to analyse this difference. First, we compared the number of glycoside hydrolases belonging to Family 13, 15, and 31 in both strains, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). We found no difference in gene numbers of glycoside hydrolases between A. sojae and A. oryzae for Family 31 including α-glucosidase (EC.3.2.1.20), and for Family 15 including glucoamylase (EC.3.2.1.3). Thus, there is unlikely to be a difference in these enzymatic activities between the two Aspergillus strains. In contrast, we found that A. sojae has two copies less glycoside hydrolases in Family 13 including α-amylase (EC.3.2.1.1) than those in A. oryzae. Missing of the two genes in A. sojae was due to the copy number variation between the two strains; A. sojae only has one copy of amyB compared with the three copies (AO090023000944: amy1, AO090120000196: amy2, and AO090003001210: amy3) in A. oryzae.28 In A. oryzae, amyB codes for so-called Taka-amylase, which is important for amylolysis. Therefore, a decreased copy number of amyB orthologues in A. sojae likely accounts for the lower amylolytic ability of A. sojae than that of A. oryzae.The above-mentioned three α-amylase genes and their flanking 20-kb regions of A. oryzae were further compared with the corresponding regions in A. sojae NBRC4239 scaffolds. We investigated whether the difference in α-amylase gene copy numbers results from the difference in genomic structures. The results are shown in Fig. 3. In the A. sojae amy1 region, the 12.5-kb sequence including 2.2 kb of amy1 ORF, and its promoter and terminator regions were absent. Instead of the 12.5-kb region, a unique 2.9-kb sequence excluding amy1 was present. This was also the case for amy2, where the 12.4-kb region including amy2 ORF, and its promoter and terminator regions were absent, but a sequence unique as observed in the amy1 region was not present in amy2. Furthermore, a 7.2-kb region was also absent and an inverted region was observed near the missing amy2 regions in A. sojae. These results indicated that this region of the A. sojae genome was structurally rearranged. In the amy3 region, we found that amy3 structural genes and its terminator regions were conserved between A. oryzae and A. sojae. However, a 1.9-kb insertion sequence was found at 0.53 kb upstream of the translation initiation site in the A. oryzae amy3 promoter.
Comparison of α-amylase genes and their flanking regions. Map of α-amylase and flanking regions. Grey box, conserved regions; shaded box, regions unique to A. sojae; white box, regions unique to A. oryzae ; black box, inversed regions; black arrow, α-amylase gene ORF; black triangle, PCR primer-binding site.We therefore confirmed that the genomic structures of the α-amylase regions predicted from genome analysis were correct for this strain by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results indicate that the difference in copy numbers of α-amylase genes between A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. oryzae RIB40 is a result of a rearrangement in genomic structure.We investigated transposons existing near the α-amylase genes in A. oryzae and A. sojae (Fig. 4A). We found that the ∼1.9-kb insertion sequence locating upstream the A. oryzae amy3 promoter is a transposon Tao1 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession number: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AB021710.1"",""term_id"":""8272377"",""term_text"":""AB021710.1""}}AB021710.1). This transposon was flanked by inverted repeat sequences characteristic to ClassII DNA transposons (Fig. 4A).29 The Tao1 insertion site at the A. oryzae amy3 promoter region was found to correspond to the ‘TA’ sequence in the −533 to −532 region upstream the A. sojae amy3 promoter. This is consistent with that ClassII transposons tend to be preferentially integrated at a TA sequence, resulting in target site TA duplication on both flanking of the integrated transposon.29 The Tao1 is located at the further upstream of the amylase transcription factor AmyR recognition site30 and the CreA recognition sites31 involved in carbon catabolite repression (Fig. 4B). It is not clear whether Tao1 insertion affects the expression of the A. oryzae amy3 gene or not, and further study will be needed to clarify the effect of Tao1 insertion.

(B) Map of transposons surrounding A. oryzae and A. sojae α-amylase genes.The Tao1 transposon was also present within the promoters of amy1 and amy2 of A. oryzae. The insertion sites were identical to amy3 insertion (Fig. 4A). However, Tao1 inserted in the amy1 and amy2 promoters were largely truncated and only partial sequences of 575 bp at the 3′-end of the total 1.9 kb sequence were left. The truncation of Tao1 in amy1 and amy2 have occurred after triplication of the single amy gene having Tao1 transposon, which inserted in the A. oryzae lineage after divergence of A. sojae from the common ancestor.We also found a 981-bp ORF similar to Ant1 transposase near amy1 and amy2 of A. oryzae. Ant1 transposon is a member of ClassII DNA transposon classified in the Tc1/mariner group,29,32 and Ant1 in A. niger is reported to have transfer activity.33 The corresponding Ant1 transposase homologues were not found in the downstream regions of amy3 of A. oryzae or amyA of A. sojae.As shown above, several transposons, such as Tao1 and Ant1 transposase homologue, were found near the three α-amylase genes of A. oryzae, but were absent around amyA of A. sojae. The mechanism for the multiplication of α-amylase gene in A. oryzae is unclear, but these transposons might have a crucial role for the amylase gene multiplication in A. oryzae. The difference in α-amylase gene copy numbers might result in the difference in amylolytic activity between the two strains. This is likely to be a major factor for why A. oryzae became widely used in industry, such as in fermentation of sake, soy sauce, and miso, whereas A. sojae became used solely for soy sauce fermentation.The 56 secondary metabolite cluster sequences were predicted using SMURF in the A. oryzae RIB40 genome.25 We analysed these clusters for the A. sojae NBRC4239 genome by Harr plots. Out of the 56 predicted secondary metabolite clusters, 24 clusters were found to be almost identical and the remaining 32 clusters differed from those in A. oryzae RIB40 (Supplementary Table S5). Aspergillus sojae NBRC4239 had no sequence homologous to Cluster 51 located on the end of chromosome 5 in A. oryzae. In addition, large portions of Clusters 38 (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase: NRPS) and 47 (NRPS) were missing in A. sojae NBRC4239 (Fig. 5). For Cluster 38, A. sojae NBRC4239 had a replaced 363-bp sequence and a sequence containing the 5′ portion of 460 bp and the 3′ portion of 2.9 kb generated by a deletion of 23 188 bp from the 26 571 bp (SC026: 1081838–1108408) predicted in A. oryzae RIB40 (Fig. 5A). For Cluster 47, the 3′ portion of 14 kb in 30 338 bp (SC102: 1249352–1279689) predicted in A. oryzae RIB40 was replaced by unrelated 17-kb sequence (Fig. 5B). Also, small deletions and insertions were observed in the remaining 29 clusters (data not shown).
Comparison of A. oryzae predicted secondary metabolite clusters with A. sojae. Secondary metabolite Clusters 38 (A) and 47 (B) which were predicted from A. oryzae RIB40 by SMURF were compared with sequences in A. sojaeNBRC4239 by Harr plots.Unlike Cluster 51 (PKS) located near the end of chromosome 5 (SC113: 1828103-1841684) in A. oryzae RIB40, missing of the equivalent cluster to Cluster 51 in A. sojae NBRC4239 may be partly explained by the instability of the region near the chromosome end in A. sojae NBRC4239. On the other hand, Clusters 38 and 47 in A. oryzae RIB40, of which equivalent clusters that had large deleted portions in A. sojae NBRC4239 are located near the centre of arm of chromosome 3 (SC26: 1081838–1108408 of 2 324 132 bp) and near the centromere of chromosome 4 (SC102: 1249352–1279689 of 1 779 707 bp), respectively. Therefore, the reasons for the depletion of these secondary metabolite gene clusters may be different from that for missing of the equivalent cluster to Cluster 51 at the chromosomal end.Gene cluster regions for CPA biosynthesis in A. flavus and A. oryzae were analysed for genomes of A. sojae NBRC4239, A. flavus NRRL3357, and A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTN.34 The results are shown in Fig. 6. In A. flavus and A. oryzae, CPA clusters were found at the end of chromosome 3, next to the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene clusters (Fig. 6). Genes mfs1, mao1, dmaT, Pks-nrps, and cttr1 shown in the figure are considered to be involved in CPA biosynthesis. Since the large portion of Pks-nrps at the telomere side is deleted, CPA cannot be synthesized in A. oryzae RIB40.34 On the other hand, 18 508 bp of the CPA biosynthesis cluster region was found to be deleted in A. sojae NBRC4239, thus most of the mfs1, mao1, dmaT, and Pks-nrps sequences were missing (Fig. 6). Furthermore, a 7653-bp sequence including ord1, ord2, and ord3 is present 25 kb distant from the CPA cluster toward the telomere side in A. flavus. This sequence was found to be inserted inversely next to the missing CPA gene cluster in A. sojae.
Comparison of CPA biosynthesis gene cluster regions between A. sojae NBRC4239, A. flavus NRRL3357, and A. oryzae RIB40. Nucleotide sequences of CPA biosynthesis gene cluster regions were compared between A. sojae NBRC4239, A. flavus NRRL3357, and A. oryzae RIB40 by BLASTN and are presented diagrammatically.PCR was carried out to confirm the missing A. sojae CPA biosynthesis gene cluster region and the inverted insert (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results confirmed the 18.5-kb deletion and the inverted 7.6-kb insertion found in the A. sojae NBRC4239 genome.In addition to the finding of complete deletion of mfs1, mao1, and dmaT, the present analysis also found the deletion of a promoter and the half of the ORF containing the ketoacyl synthase (KR) domain and the acyltransferase (AT) domain for Pks-nrps in A. sojae. The genes mao1, dmaT, and Pks-nrps are essential for CPA biosynthesis in A. flavus.26 Therefore, the present data lead to the conclusion that A. sojae is unable to produce CPA, which also verifies the safety of A. sojae for use in industry.The A. sojae genome was analysed for the aflatrem biosynthesis gene cluster found in A. flavus.27 Aflatrem biosynthesis genes in A. flavus are known to consist of genes required to synthesize the intermediate paspaline (atmG, atmC, atmM, and atmB) as well as genes required to convert paspaline to aflatrem (atmP, atmQ, and atmD), which are encoded at two separate loci ATM1 and ATM2 in A. flavus, respectively.27 ATM1 (34 816 bp) and ATM2 (25 256 bp) were analysed for the A. oryzae and A. sojae genomes by BLASTN. We found almost identical sequences to ATM1 and ATM2 with a few base substitutions in A. oryzae. In contrast, five gaps with >100 bp were found in the corresponding region to ATM1 locus in A. sojae (Fig. 7A). In Gap 4, a 1140-bp sequence in A. flavus was replaced by unrelated 6138-bp sequence in A. sojae (Fig. 7A). Nine gaps with >100 bp were also observed in the corresponding region to ATM2 locus in A. sojae (Fig. 7B). In Gap 7, a 2761-bp sequence in A. flavus was replaced by unrelated 11 493-bp sequence in A. sojae (Fig. 7B). All these gaps found in A. sojae were present in the non-coding regions. A frameshift due to single base insertion in exon 7 of atmQ was reported to account for the non-productivity of aflatrem in A. oryzae,27 but such mutation was not found in A. sojae in this study. The presence of insertions in A. sojae NBRC4239 was confirmed by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Comparison of aflatrem cluster regions in A. sojae NBRC4239 and A. flavus. Diagram of aflatrem cluster sequence comparison between A. flavus NRRL3357 and A. sojae NBRC4239 strains. (A) ATM1 region. (B) ATM2 region.In this study, we showed that A. sojae NBRC4239 had many differences in ATM1 and ATM2 loci including deletions and insertion of unrelated sequences in comparison with those in A. oryzae and A. flavus, where both loci are well conserved. In addition to these differences, more than 10 gaps <100 bp were also observed in the corresponding loci in A. sojae NBRC4239 (data not shown). As described above, all the 14 gaps were present in the non-coding regions in A. sojae. To date, production of aflatrem in A. sojae has not been reported but the present study did not provide the evidence for aflatrem non-productivity from the sequence information. Further analysis will be needed to solve this discrepancy on the aflatrem production in A. sojae.Supplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We thank S.W. Kim, M.

PMC3111534,"Finished Genome of the Fungal Wheat Pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola Reveals Dispensome Structure, Chromosome Plasticity, and Stealth Pathogenesis",False,"The plant-pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola (asexual stage: Septoria tritici) causes septoria tritici blotch, a disease that greatly reduces the yield and quality of wheat. This disease is economically important in most wheat-growing areas worldwide and threatens global food production. Control of the disease has been hampered by a limited understanding of the genetic and biochemical bases of pathogenicity, including mechanisms of infection and of resistance in the host. Unlike most other plant pathogens, M. graminicola has a long latent period during which it evades host defenses. Although this type of stealth pathogenicity occurs commonly in Mycosphaerella and other Dothideomycetes, the largest class of plant-pathogenic fungi, its genetic basis is not known. To address this problem, the genome of M. graminicola was sequenced completely. The finished genome contains 21 chromosomes, eight of which could be lost with no visible effect on the fungus and thus are dispensable. This eight-chromosome dispensome is dynamic in field and progeny isolates, is different from the core genome in gene and repeat content, and appears to have originated by ancient horizontal transfer from an unknown donor. Synteny plots of the M. graminicola chromosomes versus those of the only other sequenced Dothideomycete, Stagonospora nodorum, revealed conservation of gene content but not order or orientation, suggesting a high rate of intra-chromosomal rearrangement in one or both species. This observed “mesosynteny” is very different from synteny seen between other organisms. A surprising feature of the M. graminicola genome compared to other sequenced plant pathogens was that it contained very few genes for enzymes that break down plant cell walls, which was more similar to endophytes than to pathogens. The stealth pathogenesis of M. graminicola probably involves degradation of proteins rather than carbohydrates to evade host defenses during the biotrophic stage of infection and may have evolved from endophytic ancestors.The plant-pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola causes septoria tritici blotch, one of the most economically important diseases of wheat worldwide and a potential threat to global food production. Unlike most other plant pathogens, M. graminicola has a long latent period during which it seems able to evade host defenses, and its genome appears to be unstable with many chromosomes that can change size or be lost during sexual reproduction. To understand its unusual mechanism of pathogenicity and high genomic plasticity, the genome of M. graminicola was sequenced more completely than that of any other filamentous fungus. The finished sequence contains 21 chromosomes, eight of which were different from those in the core genome and appear to have originated by ancient horizontal transfer from an unknown donor. The dispensable chromosomes collectively comprise the dispensome and showed extreme plasticity during sexual reproduction. A surprising feature of the M. graminicola genome was a low number of genes for enzymes that break down plant cell walls; this may represent an evolutionary response to evade detection by plant defense mechanisms. The stealth pathogenicity of M. graminicola may involve degradation of proteins rather than carbohydrates and could have evolved from an endophytic ancestor.The ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola (Figure S1) causes septoria tritici blotch (STB), a foliar disease of wheat that poses a significant threat to global food production. Losses to STB can reduce yields of wheat by 30 to 50% with a huge economic impact [1]; global expenditures for fungicides to manage STB total hundreds of millions of dollars each year [2]–[3]. This fungus is difficult to control because populations contain extremely high levels of genetic variability [4] and it has very unusual biology for a pathogen. Unlike most other plant pathogens [5]–[7], M. graminicola infects through stomata rather than by direct penetration and there is a long latent period of up to two weeks following infection before symptoms develop. The fungus evades host defenses [8] during the latent phase, followed by a rapid switch to necrotrophy immediately prior to symptom expression 12–20 days after penetration [5], [9]–[10]. Such a switch from biotrophic to necrotrophic growth at the end of a long latent period is an unusual characteristic shared by most fungi in the genus Mycosphaerella. Very little is known about the cause or mechanism of this lifestyle switch [9]–[10] even though Mycosphaerella is one of the largest and most economically important genera of plant-pathogenic fungi.A striking aspect of M. graminicola genetics is the presence of many dispensable chromosomes [11]. These can be lost readily in sexual progeny with no apparent effect on fitness. However, the structure and function of dispensable chromosomes are not known. Here we report the first genome of a filamentous fungus to be finished according to current standards [12]. The 21-chromosome, 39.7-Mb genome of M. graminicola revealed an apparently novel origin for dispensable chromosomes by horizontal transfer followed by extensive recombination, a possible mechanism of stealth pathogenicity and exciting new aspects of genome structure. The genome provides a finished reference for the Dothideomycetes, the largest class of ascomycete fungi, which also includes the apple scab pathogen Venturia inaequalis, the southern corn leaf blight pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus, the black Sigatoka pathogen of banana, M. fijiensis, and numerous other pathogens of almost every crop.The finished genome of M. graminicola isolate IPO323 consists of 21 complete chromosomes, telomere to telomere (Figure S2), with the exceptions of one telomere of chromosome 21 and two internal gaps of unclonable DNA that are missing from chromosome 18 (Table 1). Alignments between the 21 chromosomes and two genetic linkage maps yielded an excellent correspondence (Figure 1 and Figure S3), representing the most complete and the first finished sequence of a filamentous fungus. The next most complete genome of a filamentous fungus is that of Aspergillus fumigatus, which did not include centromere sequences and contained 11 gaps in total [13]. The complete 43,960-bp mitochondrial genome also was obtained and has been described elsewhere [14].A, Plot of GC content. Areas of low GC usually correspond to regions of repetitive DNA. B, Repetitive regions of the M. graminicola genome. C, Single-copy (red) regions of the M. graminicola genome. D, Locations of genes for proteins containing signal peptides. E, Locations of homologs involved in pathogenicity or virulence that have been experimentally verified in species pathogenic to plant, animal or human hosts. F, Approximate locations of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for pathogenicity to wheat. G, Alignments between the genomic sequence and two genetic linkage maps of crosses involving isolate IPO323. Top half, Genetic linkage map of the cross between IPO323 and the Algerian durum wheat isolate IPO95052. Bottom half, Genetic linkage map of the cross between bread wheat isolates IPO323 and IPO94269. The physical map represented by the genomic sequence is in the center. Lines connect mapped genetic markers in each linkage map to their corresponding locations on the physical map based on the sequences of the marker loci. Exceptions to the almost perfect alignment between the three maps are indicated by crossed lines, most likely due to occasional incorrect scorings of the marker alleles. Chromosome 2 was used for this illustration because no QTL mapped to chromosome 1.Comparative genome hybridizations using a whole-genome tiling array made from the genome sequence of IPO323 demonstrated striking sexually activated chromosomal plasticity in progeny isolates (Figure 2) and chromosome number polymorphisms in field isolates. For example, isolate IPO94269, a field strain from bread wheat in the Netherlands, was missing two chromosomes that were present in IPO323 (Figure 2A).A, CGH between IPO323 and the Dutch field isolate IPO94269. B, CGH between IPO323 and progeny isolate #51 from the cross between IPO323 and IPO94269. C, CGH between IPO323 and progeny isolate #2133 of the cross between IPO323 and IPO95052. D, CGH between IPO323 and Algerian field isolate IPO95052, which was isolated from and is adapted to durum (tetraploid) wheat. The genomic difference between the strains for each CGH is shown by 21 box plots, one for each chromosome of M. graminicola. The horizontal line in each box is the median log ratio of hybridization signals of the two strains; the upper and lower ends of a box represent the 25% and 75% quartiles. The whiskers extending from each box indicate 1.5 times the interquartile range, the distance between the 25% and 75% quartiles. The larger the deviation from 0, the greater the difference between the strains for a particular chromosome. Pink boxes that are significantly less than the zero line indicate missing chromosomes. The purple boxes in panel B (4 and 18) that are significantly higher than the zero line indicate chromosomes that are disomic.Sexual-driven genome plasticity was particularly evident among progeny isolates in the two mapping populations, including losses of chromosomes that were present in both parents and disomy for others [11]. For example, progeny isolate #51 of the cross between IPO323 and IPO94269 lost chromosomes 14 and 21 (Figure 2B) even though they were present in both parents. This isolate also was missing chromosome 20, which was polymorphic for presence between the parents of the cross. More surprisingly, this isolate was disomic for chromosomes 4 and 18 (Figure 2B), indicating that chromosomes can be both gained and lost during meiosis. For chromosome 18, both copies must have originated from IPO323 because no homolog was present in IPO94269. Molecular markers for chromosome 4 appeared to be heterozygous indicating that both parents contributed a copy to progeny isolate #51 (data not shown). Progeny isolate #2133 of the cross between isolates IPO323 and IPO95052 showed loss of three dispensable chromosomes (15, 18 and 21) that were present in both parents (Figure 2C), most likely due to non-disjunction during meiosis. Thus, extreme genome plasticity was manifested as chromosome number and size polymorphisms [11] that were generated during meiosis and extended to core as well as dispensable chromosomes.The whole-genome hybridizations also indicated that the core and dispensable chromosomes can be remarkably uniform for gene content, given the high capacity of the latter for change. Comparative genome hybridizations between IPO323 and IPO95052, an isolate from a field of durum wheat in Algeria, showed that they had the same complement of core and dispensable chromosomes (Figure 2D). This was surprising, because populations of the pathogen from durum wheat (a tetraploid) usually are adapted to that host and not to hexaploid bread wheat, yet the chromosomal complements of isolates from these hosts on different continents were the same.Evidence for repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), a mechanism in fungi that inactivates transposons by introducing C to T transitions in repeated sequences [15]–[16], was seen in genome-wide analyses of transition∶transversion ratios in long terminal repeat (LTR) pairs from 20 retrotransposon insertions which had 255 transitions and 6 transversions for a ratio of 42.5∶1. Similarly high transition∶transversion ratios were found in all repetitive sequences analyzed and extended to the coding regions in addition to the LTRs [17]. The reverse transcriptase coding regions from transposon families RT11 and RT15 had transition∶transversion ratios of 27.8∶1 and 25.3∶1, respectively, instead of the 1∶1 ratio expected among 6,939 mutations analyzed. This high incidence of transitions most likely reflects changes caused by RIP. The coding regions of all transposons with more than 10 copies included stop codons that prevent proper translation, indicating that they were inactivated.There were significant differences in structure and gene content between the 13 core and eight dispensable chromosomes (Table 1 and Table 2); the latter are referred to collectively as the dispensome. The dispensome constituted about 12% of the genomic DNA but contained only 6% of the genes. In contrast, the 13 core chromosomes had twice as many genes per Mb of DNA, about half as much repetitive DNA, a significantly higher G+C content, and much higher numbers of unique genes (Table 1 and Table 2). Genes in the dispensome were significantly shorter, usually were truncated relative to those on the core chromosomes (Table 2) and had dramatic differences in codon usage (Figure S4).About 59% of the genes on core chromosomes could be annotated compared to only 10% of those on the dispensome (Table 2). Some unique genes in the dispensome with intact, presumably functional reading frames, had possible paralogs on the core chromosomes (Figure S5) that appeared to be inactivated by mutations (Figure S6). A majority of the annotated dispensome genes coded for putative transcription factors or otherwise may function in gene regulation or signal transduction (Table S1). Most of the redundant genes on the dispensome were copies of genes present on core chromosomes, yet no syntenic relationships could be identified. Instead, each dispensable chromosome contained genes and repetitive sequences from all or most of the core chromosomes (Figure 3 and Figure S7) with additional unique genes of unknown origin. Sharing of genetic material applied to core chromosomes as well as the dispensome, consistent with a high level of recombination (Figure S8). Whether the primary direction of transfer is from core to dispensable chromosomes or vice versa is not known.Each chromosome is drawn to scale as a numbered bar around the outer edge of the circle, and the sequence was masked for repetitive DNA prior to analysis. Lines connect regions of 100 bp or larger that are similar between each core chromosome and the corresponding region on chromosome 14 at 1×e−5 or lower. Chromosome 14 is an amalgamation of genes from all of the core chromosomes but they are mixed together with no synteny. Genes on the other dispensable chromosomes were not included in this analysis.The dispensome contained fewer genes encoding secreted proteins such as effectors and other possible pathogenicity factors compared to the core set. Signal peptides showed no enrichment on the dispensome (Table S1) except for a few clusters overlapping with transposon-related repeats. Although mature microRNAs have not been demonstrated in fungi, they may be important regulatory molecules. In the M. graminicola genome, 418 non-overlapping loci potentially encoding pre-microRNA-like small RNA (pre-milRNA) were predicted computationally based on the RFAM database [18]. This number was similar to the 434 loci predicted in the 41-Mb genome of Neurospora crassa using the same approach. Of the 418 putative pre-milRNA loci predicted in the genome of M. graminicola, 88 (21%) are located on the 11% of the genome present as dispensome. This is about twice as much as is expected on the basis of a random distribution. Therefore, the dispensome is enriched for pre-milRNA loci.The 418 pre-milRNA loci code for 385 non-redundant pre-milRNA sequences that can give rise to distinguishable mature milRNAs. The occurrence of mature milRNAs derived from the predicted set was analyzed in a small-RNA data consisting of almost 6 million reads (Illumina platform) generated from germinated spores of M. graminicola isolate IPO323 (Table S2).Many of the non-redundant predicted milRNA sequences were represented in the RNA reads, at widely different amounts per sequence. In total, 65 of the 385 non-redundant sequences were observed 10 times or more. Two predicted sequences occurred more than a thousand times each, experimentally confirming the presence of putatively mature milRNAs derived from computationally predicted pre-milRNA sequences. In N. crassa, computationally predicted putative milRNA sequences also were confirmed experimentally [19], supporting the likelihood of their existence in M. graminicola.The origin of the dispensome of M. graminicola is not clear. The two most likely origins would be degeneration of copies of the core chromosomes or by horizontal transfer. Disomy for core chromosomes, as seen in one of the progeny isolates, could provide the origin for a dispensable chromosome. If one of the two chromosome copies became preferentially subject to RIP followed by breakage or interstitial deletions this could result in a degenerated copy of that core chromosome. However, in that case we would expect the dispensome to share large regions of synteny with specific core chromosomes, and this was not observed, which renders this explanation less likely.The large differences in codon usage between core and dispensable chromosomes could be explained by horizontal transfer or possibly by RIP. To discriminate between these hypotheses, RIP was simulated on the genes of the core chromosomes. Principal components analysis (PCA) of the simulated data set did not reduce the differences in codon bias (Figure S9A); if anything, it made them farther apart. This result was consistent whether it included only putative functional, truncated copies or entire pseudogenes after RIPping (data not shown). DeRIPping of genes on the dispensable chromosomes also did not affect the results (Figure S9B), so RIP could not explain the observed differences in codon usage between core and dispensable chromosomes. PCA of a sample of genes shared between core and dispensable chromosomes showed few differences in codon bias (Figure S9C) or amino acid composition (Figure S9D), consistent with an origin by duplication and exchange among chromosomes. This conclusion was supported when the analysis was expanded to include all genes with putative homologs on core and dispensable chromosomes (Figure S9E) even though these genes had a very different codon usage compared to the entire sets of genes on the core chromosomes (Figure S9F).To test the horizontal transfer hypothesis, additional PCAs were performed on simulated horizontal transfer data sets made by combining the genome of M. graminicola with those of two other fungi. Best non-self BLAST hits for genes on the M. graminicola dispensome most often were to fungi in the Pleosporales or Eurotiales (Table S3), so published genomes from species representing those orders were chosen for analysis. PCA of the combined genomes of M. graminicola and Stagonospora nodorum (representing the Pleosporales) gave separate, tight clusters for the core chromosomes of M. graminicola versus most of those from S. nodorum (Figure S10A). Dispensable chromosomes of M. graminicola formed a looser, distinct cluster, and a fourth cluster was comprised of M. graminicola chromosome 14 plus scaffolds 44 and 45 of S. nodorum (Figure S10A); this may indicate the existence of dispensable chromosomes in the latter species. Analysis of the combined genomes of M. graminicola plus Aspergillus fumigatus (Eurotiales) gave a similar result (Figure S10B). The separate clustering by PCA of the M. graminicola dispensome and core chromosomes is consistent with an origin by horizontal transfer, but not from either of the two species tested. PCA on the frequencies of repetitive elements also indicated a separation between core and dispensable chromosomes (Figure S11), consistent with the horizontal transfer hypothesis.A more refined test of the RIP hypothesis was performed by using the observed rates of all mutations in families of transposons with 10 or more elements to simulate mutational changes on replicated samples drawn from the core chromosomes. Observed mutation rates were calculated from aligned sequences; multicopy transposons were chosen for this analysis because they are the most likely to have been processed through the RIP machinery so will reflect the actual biases that occur in M. graminicola. Codon bias and other parameters in the mutated samples were then compared to those in the dispensome and in the original, non-mutated samples. Application of the mutational changes moved the samples drawn from the core chromosomes closer to the value observed for the dispensome, but the dispensome remained distinct except for a few of the analyses that are least likely to be affected by selection (Figure 4). This confirmed that the dispensome has been subject to RIP but that this alone was not sufficient to explain the observed pattern of codon usage.Mutation was simulated using observed frequencies of all mutations in families of transposable elements with ten or more copies, and included mutations from RIP and other processes. Mutating the samples of genes from the core chromosomes always made them more similar to the observed value for the dispensome but only rarely included the dispensome value (see panel C). This occurred primarily with codon preference and GC content by amino acid, which are the quantities that are least subject to natural selection for protein function. A, amino acid frequency using the values for the aligned sequence with the highest GC content to build the table of mutation frequencies; B, codon preference using the consensus of the aligned sequences to make the table of mutation frequencies covering only the 5′ portion of each gene; C, codon preference using the values for the aligned sequence with the highest GC content to build the table of mutation frequencies covering only the 5′ portion of each gene; D, codon usage using the values for the aligned sequence with the highest GC content to build the table of mutation frequencies but with all mutation frequencies cut in half; E, codon usage using the values for the aligned sequence with the highest GC content to build the table of mutation frequencies; and F, GC skew using the consensus of the aligned sequences to make the table of mutation frequencies. The first principal component always separated out the pre- and post-mutated chromosome samples. The locations of the observed values for the dispensome (S) are circled.Pairwise sequence comparisons between the chromosomes of M. graminicola and scaffolds of Stagonospora nodorum, another wheat pathogen in the Dothideomycetes but in a different order from Mycosphaerella, revealed multiple regions with approximately 70–90% similarity (Figure 5). However, the similarity did not extend to the dispensome, which generally was different from all of the S. nodorum scaffolds. Detailed examination showed that each region of similarity generally represents only one or a few genes in both organisms. Comparisons between the initial draft genome (version 1.0) of M. graminicola (Figure 5A) and the finished sequence (Figure 5B) revealed some misassemblies and also indicated scaffolds that ultimately were joined in the final assembly.Scaffolds/chromosomes are ordered along their respective axes according to both decreasing length and increasing number. The 6-frame translations of both genomes were compared via MUMMER 3.0 [53]. Homologous regions are plotted as dots, which are color coded for percent similarity as per the bar on the right. Amendments made in the version 2 assembly and their corresponding regions in assembly version 1 are circled in red. Version 2 chromosomes 5 (B, circle II), 7 (B, circle I) and 10 (B, circle III) were derived from joined version 1 scaffolds 7 and 17 (A, circle II), 10 and 14 (A, circle I) and 12 and 22 (A, circle III), respectively, validating the method. Observation of the mesosyntenic pattern also could be used to identify inappropriately joined scaffolds. For example, M. graminicola v2 chromosomes 6 and 16 (B, circle IV) and 12 and 21 (B, circle V) were derived from split version 1 scaffolds 4 (A, circle IV) and 9 (A, circle V), respectively. These scaffolds are characterized by an abrupt termination of the mesosyntenic block at the split point as indicated by red lines (A, circles IV and V). A total of 21 predictions was made and 14 were validated.A surprising result was that the dot-plot patterns were very different from those that characterize the macro- or microsynteny seen in other organisms when viewed at a whole-scaffold/chromosome scale. Instead of the expected diagonal lines indicating chromosomal regions with content in the same order and orientation, the dots are scattered quasi-randomly within ‘blocks’ defined by scaffold/chromosome boundaries (Figure 5). For many S. nodorum scaffolds the vast majority of dots related are shared exclusively with one or a small number of M. graminicola chromosomes. For example, there are predominant one-to-one relationships between M. graminicola version 3 chromosomes 11 and 12 with S. nodorum scaffolds 21 and 7 (Figure 5B, circle V), respectively. Similarly, M. graminicola chromosomes 5–10 each had strong relationships with 2 to 4 scaffolds of S. nodorum. We refer to this conservation of gene content but not order or orientation among chromosomes as ‘mesosynteny’. Analyses of additional genomes has shown that mesosynteny as defined here occurs among all Dothideomycetes tested and may be unique to that class of fungi (data not presented).Macrosyntenic relationships are used commonly to assist the assembly and finishing of fragmented genome sequences [20]–[23], particularly in prokaryotes. Sequences that are macrosyntenic to a long segment of a closely related genome are highly likely to be joined physically. If mesosynteny between a new genome assembly and a reference genome also may be used to suggest scaffolds that should be juxtaposed it could significantly reduce the cost and complexity of assembling and finishing genomes. To test whether mesosynteny could be used to predict scaffold or contig joins in a genomic sequence, versions 1 and 2 of the M. graminicola genome assembly were analyzed to determine whether any of the improvements in the finished genome could have been predicted bioinformatically by mesosynteny (Dataset S1).The first version of the M. graminicola genome consisted of 129 scaffolds (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Mycgr1/Mycgr1.home.html). Comparison of M. graminicola version 1 scaffolds with those of the P. nodorum genome predicted all scaffold joins made in version 2 (Figure 5, Dataset S1). Version 1 scaffolds 10 and 14 (Figure 5: group I), 7 and 17 (groups II, VII and IX), and 12 and 22 (groups III and VIII) were joined into chromosomes 7, 5 and 10, respectively. Mesosynteny also indicated both instances where version 1 scaffolds were assembled incorrectly and subsequently were split in version 2. Compared to the scaffolds of P. nodorum, M. graminicola version 1 scaffold 4 exhibited regions of mesosynteny adjacent to regions of no synteny. Corrections to the assembly made in version 2 separated these two distinct regions into separate chromosomes. Version 1 scaffolds 4 and 9 (Figure 5: groups IV/VI and V) were corrected to version 2 chromosomes 6 and 16 (Figure 5: group IV/VI) and chromosomes 12 and 21 (Figure 5: group V) respectively. Mesosynteny was remarkably successful and has great potential to assist the assembly and finishing of fungal genomes.Generally, gene families involved in cell wall degradation are expanded in fungal plant pathogens [24]–[25]. However, in M. graminicola, gene families characterized by the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme database (CAZy) [26] as plant cell wall polysaccharidases were severely reduced in size (Figure 6). According to the CAZy analysis, the genome of M. graminicola contains fewer genes for cellulose degradation than those of six other fungi with sequenced genomes including both grass pathogens and saprophytes (Table 3), and only about one-third as many genes for cell wall degradation in total compared to the other plant pathogens (Table S4). This reduction in CAZymes in M. graminicola was very visible when the putative genes were divided based on polysaccharide substrate (Table S4). In addition, genes involved in appressorium formation, which are required for pathogenesis of many plant pathogens including Magnaporthe oryzae
[27], were absent or reduced in the Mycosphaerella graminicola genome, reflecting its alternative host-penetration strategy.Genes for PCW-polysaccharidases were severely reduced in the genome of Mycosphaerella graminicola but proteases were about the same. The overall profile of the enzymes in M. graminicola was most similar to that of T. reesei than to any of the other plant pathogens. Species analyzed included the saprophytes Aspergillus nidulans (Anid), Neurospora crassa (Ncra), and Trichoderma reesei (Trees), and the plant pathogens Fusarium graminearum (Fgram), Mycosphaerella graminicola (Mgram), Magnaporthe oryzae (Moryz), and Stagonospora nodorum (Snod).To further analyze the mechanism of stealth pathogenesis, we profiled the growth on polysaccharides of M. graminicola compared to Stagonospora nodorum and Magnaporthe oryzae, two pathogens of the cereals wheat and rice, respectively, with sequenced genomes (Figure S12). Growth of M. graminicola corresponded with the CAZy annotation for a strongly reduced number of genes encoding putative xylan-degrading enzymes. Furthermore, the CAZy annotation demonstrated that M. graminicola contains a much smaller set of glycoside hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases, and carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) compared to the other two cereal pathogens (Table S5). The strong reduction of CBMs in M. graminicola suggests a different strategy in the degradation of plant cell walls compared to the other two species. The M. graminicola genome is particularly depauperate for enzymes degrading cellulose, xylan and xyloglucan compared to the other two species, so is very atypical for a cereal pathogen.A possible mechanism of stealth pathogenesis was indicated by gene families that were expanded in the genome of M. graminicola. In comparative analyses of gene families and PFAM domains with several other fungi, the most striking expansions were observed for peptidases (M3, S28, pro-kuma, M24, metalloendopeptidase, metalloproteinase) and alpha amylases (glycoside hydrolase family 13) (Tables S6 and S7). This suggests that alternative nutrition sources during the biotrophic phase of infection may be proteins which are available in the apoplast, or possibly starch from chloroplasts that are released early in the infection process [5]. Overall, these analyses revealed that the genome of M. graminicola differs significantly from those of other cereal pathogens with respect to genes involved in plant penetration as well as polysaccharide and protein degradation (Figure 6, Table 3), which most likely reflects its stealthy mode of pathogenesis.Differences in gene expression during the different stages of infection were evident from an analysis of EST sequences [9] from wheat leaves 5, 10 and 16 days after inoculation (DAI) with M. graminicola. Most genes were present at only one sampling time with little overlap, particularly between the library from the biotrophic stage of infection (5 DAI) compared to the other two (Figure S13A). Lack of overlap extended to a library from minimal medium minus nitrogen to simulate the nitrogen starvation thought to occur during infection (Figure S13B). Expression of genes for cell wall-degrading enzymes also was reduced during the biotrophic stage of infection [9], consistent with the stealth-pathogenicity hypothesis.The dispensome as defined here includes all parts of the genome that can be missing in field or progeny isolates with no obvious effects on fitness in axenic culture, on a susceptible host or during mating. For M. graminicola, this includes the eight known dispensable chromosomes in isolate IPO323 plus any others that may be discovered in the future. The core genome consists of all chromosomes that are always present in field and progeny isolates, presumably because they contain genes that are vital for survival so cannot be lost. Both core and dispensable chromosomes may be present in two or possibly more copies, but core chromosomes are never absent.The dispensome of M. graminicola is very different from the supernumerary or B chromosomes in plants and some animals. The B chromosomes of plants contain few if any genes and are composed mostly of repetitive elements assembled from the A chromosomes. They may have a negative effect on fitness [28] and appear to be maintained primarily by meiotic drive [29]. In contrast, the dispensome of M. graminicola contains many unique and redundant genes and is not maintained by meiotic drive, as individual chromosomes are lost readily during meiosis [11].Dispensable chromosomes have been reported in other fungi but they are significantly fewer and larger (from 0.7 to 4.9 Mb with an average of about 1.5 to 2.0 Mb) than those in M. graminicola (from 0.42 to 0.77 Mb) and mostly are composed of repetitive DNA with few known genes [30]. Unlike the dispensome of M. graminicola, the few genes on dispensable chromosomes in other fungi often are pathogenicity factors [31]–[33] and whole chromosomes may be transferred asexually [34]. Dispensable chromosomes in other fungi are different from the dispensome of M. graminicola except for the conditionally dispensable or lineage-specific chromosomes reported recently in Nectria haematococca (asexual stage: Fusarium solani) and other species of Fusarium [35]–[36], which also were different from core chromosomes in structure and gene content and contained numerous unique genes. However, unlike those in M. graminicola, dispensable chromosomes of Fusarium species had clear functions in ecological adaptation, were transferred more or less intact among closely related species [35] and did not show extensive recombination with core chromosomes.The high instability of the M. graminicola dispensome during meiosis and mitosis would cause it to be eliminated unless it provided a selective advantage to the pathogen at least under some conditions. The unique genes with annotations indicated possible functions in transcription or signal transduction. There also was an enrichment for predicted pre-milRNAs, which may indicate that parts of the dispensome are involved in gene regulation. Based on dispensable chromosomes in other plant pathogens, genes on the dispensome were expected to be involved with host adaptation or pathogenicity, yet so far no genes for pathogenicity or fitness of M. graminicola have been mapped to the dispensome [37]. A more interesting possibility is that the dispensome facilitates high recombination among chromosomes and could provide a repository of genes that may be advantageous under certain environmental conditions. This hypothesis should be tested by additional experimentation.A recent comparison of the M. graminicola genome with that of its closest known relative, the unnamed species S1 from wild grasses in Iran, identified probable homologs for all of the dispensome chromosomes in the sibling species except for chromosome 18 [38]. These putative homologs presumably are dispensable also in species S1, but this has not been proven and only one isolate has been sequenced. Species S1 and M. graminicola are thought to have diverged approximately 10,500 years ago [39], concomitant with the domestication of wheat as a crop. Therefore, unlike dispensable chromosomes in other fungi, the dispensome of M. graminicola appears to be relatively ancient and has survived at least one speciation event. Analyses of two recently sequenced Dothideomycetes with Mycosphaerella sexual stages, M. pini (asexual stage: Dothistroma septosporum) and M. populorum (asexual stage: Septoria musiva), showed that they contained clear homologs of all of the core chromosomes of M. graminicola, but none of their chromosomes corresponded to the dispensome (B. Dhillon and S. B. Goodwin, unpublished). Taken together, these observations indicate that the dispensome of M. graminicola most likely was acquired prior to its divergence from a common ancestor with species S1 more than 10,000 years ago, but after the split of the M.graminicola-S1 lineage from that which gave rise to M. pini and M. populorum. The mechanism for the longevity of this dispensome with no obvious effects on fitness is not known.More than half of the genes on the dispensome and almost all of the transposons also were present on core chromosomes. Moreover, there was no increase in gene numbers so a simple transfer of chromosomes from another species does not explain all of the observations. Instead, we propose a new model for the origin of dispensable chromosomes in M. graminicola by horizontal transfer followed by degeneration and extensive recombination with core chromosomes. The tight clustering of the dispensable chromosomes in the PCAs, with the possible exception of chromosome 14, indicates that they probably came from the same donor species. However, it is difficult to explain why they are so numerous. The most likely mechanism of horizontal transfer is via a sexual or somatic fusion with another species that had eight or more chromosomes, in which only a few genes were maintained on each donated chromosome. Chromosome segments that were redundant with the core set could be eliminated, leaving only those that are unique or that could confer some sort of selective advantage to the individual or to the dispensome. The fitness advantage could be transitory or occur only under certain conditions to allow those chromosomes to be dispensable, at least on an individual or population basis. Another possibility is that the numerous dispensable chromosomes are fragments from one or two larger chromosomes that were broken, acquired additional telomeres and lost content to result in their current, reduced complements of genes. High recombination within chromosomes and transfer of content between the donor and host chromosomes must have occurred to explain the observed pattern of shared genes.The recombination hypothesis is supported by degenerated copies of some unique genes that were found on core chromosomes. These most likely represent genes that were copied from core to dispensable chromosomes, after which the copy on the core chromosome became inactivated, probably by RIP. Duplication, diversification and differential gene loss were proposed recently as the origin of lineage-specific gene islands in Aspergillus fumigatus
[40], but that process seems to be very different from what occurred in M. graminicola. In A. fumigatus, large blocks of genes with synteny to other chromosomes were found, the opposite of what was seen for M. graminicola. The origin and evolution of the dispensome in M. graminicola seems to be very different from those reported for dispensable chromosomes in other fungi [35]. Unlike other fungi in which single chromosomes seem to have been transferred recently, the dispensome of M. graminicola most likely originated by ancient horizontal transfer of many chromosomes thousands of years ago. So far it is not known to be conditionally dispensable, unlike dispensable chromosomes in other fungi, which have clear roles in ecological adaptation.The mesosyntenic analyses provided a new approach that complements the use of genetic linkage maps to support whole-genome assembly. Gene content was highly conserved on syntenic chromosomes in the two distantly related species, but there was little or no conservation of gene order or orientation. The comparison of the version 1 assembly of M. graminicola with the related S. nodorum genome sequence indicated scaffolds that should be merged and others that were erroneously assembled into one scaffold. Hence, mesosynteny validated the high-density genetic analyses and may provide an additional tool for whole-genome assembly for fungi where linkage maps do not exist or cannot be generated. Groups of genes in S. nodorum that corresponded to more than one group in M. graminicola may indicate scaffolds that should be joined in S. nodorum or, more likely, may reflect chromosomal rearrangements that have occurred since the divergence of S. nodorum and M. graminicola from an ancient common ancestor.Considering their early divergence [41] relative to species within the same genus, the degree of mesosyntenic conservation between M. graminicola and S. nodorum is striking. However, it is very surprising that the synteny only applied to gene content but not order or orientation. In comparisons between other organisms, synteny plots usually yield diagonal lines even between unrelated species such as humans and cats [42]. The lack of diagonal lines in the comparisons of S. nodorum with M. graminicola indicate a high rate of shuffling of genes on chromosomal blocks that have remained constant over long periods of evolutionary time. The mechanism by which these small chromosomal rearrangements occur is not known.The greatly reduced number of cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) in the genome of M. graminicola compared with other sequenced fungal genomes might be an evolutionary adaptation to avoid detection by the host during its extended, biotrophic latent phase and thus evade plant defenses long enough to cause disease. Similar loss of CWDEs in the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria bicolor was thought to represent an adaptation to a symbiotic lifestyle [43]. Based on these results we propose a novel, biphasic mechanism of stealth pathogenesis. During penetration and early colonization, M. graminicola produces a reduced set of proteins that facilitate pathogenicity and function as effectors in other fungi. Instead of the usual carbohydrate metabolism, nutrition during the extended biotrophic phase may be by degradation of proteins rather than carbohydrates in the apoplastic fluid and intercellular spaces. The large number of proteases expressed during the early stages of the infection process supports this hypothesis. The biotrophic phase terminates by a switch to necrotrophic growth, production of specific cell wall-degrading enzymes and possibly by triggering programmed cell death [5], [9]–[10].Stealth biotrophy raises the intriguing possibility that M. graminicola and possibly other Dothideomycetes may have evolved originally as endophytes or could be evolving towards an endophytic lifestyle. The finished genome of M. graminicola provides a gold standard [12] for this class of fungi, which is the largest and most ecologically diverse group of Ascomycetes with approximately 20,000 species, classified in 11 orders and 90 families, and provides a huge advantage for comparative genomics to identify the genetic basis of highly divergent lifestyles.
Mycosphaerella graminicola isolates IPO323 and IPO94269 are Dutch field strains that were isolated in 1984 and 1994 from the wheat cultivar Arminda and an unknown cultivar, respectively. Isolate IPO95052 was isolated from a durum (tetraploid) wheat sample from Algeria. All isolates are maintained at the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (Utrecht, the Netherlands) under accession numbers CBS 115943 (IPO323), CBS 115941 (IPO94269) and CBS 115942 (IPO95052). Mycelia of each isolate were used to inoculate 200 mL of YG broth (10 g of yeast extract and 30 g of glucose per L) and were cultured until cloudy by shaking at 120 rpm at 18°C, after which the spores were lyophilized, 50 mg of lyophilised spores were placed in a 2-mL tube and ground with a Hybaid Ribolyser (model n° FP120HY-230) for 10 s at 2500 rpm with a tungsten carbide bead. DNA was extracted using the Promega Wizard Magnetic DNA Purification system for food according to instructions provided by the manufacturer.Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing of the genome of M. graminicola used three libraries with insert sizes of 2–3, 6–8, and 35–40 kb. The sequenced reads were screened for vector using cross_match, trimmed for vector and quality, and filtered to remove reads shorter than 100 bases. WGS assembly was done using Jazz, a tool developed at the JGI [44]. After excluding redundant and short scaffolds, the assembly v1.0 contained 41.2 Mb of sequence in 129 scaffolds, of which 4.0 Mb (7.5%) was in gaps (Table S8). The sequence depth derived from the assembly was 8.88±0.04.To perform finishing, the M. graminicola WGS assembly was broken down into scaffold-size pieces and each piece was reassembled with phrap. These scaffold pieces were then finished using a Phred/Phrap/Consed pipeline. Initially, all low-quality regions and gaps were targeted with computationally selected sequencing reactions completed with 4∶1 BigDye terminator: dGTP chemistry (Applied Biosystems). These automated rounds included resequencing plasmid subclones and walking on plasmid subclones or fosmids using custom primers.Following completion of the automated rounds, a trained finisher manually inspected each assembly. Further reactions were then manually selected to complete the genome. These included additional resequencing reactions and custom primer walks on plasmid subclones or fosmids as described above guided by a genetic map of more than 2,031 sequenced markers plus paired-end reads from a library of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome clones. Smaller repeats in the sequence were resolved by transposon-hopping 8-kb plasmid clones. Fosmid and BAC clones were shotgun sequenced and finished to fill large gaps, resolve larger repeats and to extend into the telomere regions.Each assembly was then validated by an independent quality assessment. This included a visual examination of subclone paired ends using Orchid (http://www-hagsc.org), and visual inspection of high-quality discrepancies and all remaining low-quality areas. All available EST resources were also placed on the assembly to ensure completeness. The finished genome consists of 39,686,251 base pairs of finished sequence with an estimated error rate of less than 1 in 100,000 base pairs. Genome contiguity is very high with a total of 21 chromosomes represented, 19 of which are complete and 20 of which are sequenced from telomere to telomere.Both draft (v1.0) and finished (v2.0) assemblies of M. graminicola were processed using the JGI annotation pipeline, which combines several gene predictors:1) putative full-length genes from EST cluster consensus sequences; 2) homology-based gene models were predicted using FGENESH+ [45] and Genewise [46] seeded by Blastx alignments against sequences from the NCBI non-redundant protein set; 3) ab initio gene predictor FGENESH [45] was trained on the set of putative full-length genes and reliable homology-based models. Genewise models were completed using scaffold data to find start and stop codons. ESTs were used to extend, verify, and complete the predicted gene models. Because multiple gene models per locus were often generated, a single representative gene model for each locus was chosen based on homology and EST support and used for further analysis. Those comprised a filtered set of gene models supported by different lines of evidence. These were further curated manually during community annotation and used for analysis.All predicted gene models were annotated using InterProScan [47] and hardware-accelerated double-affine Smith-Waterman alignments (www.timelogic.com) against the SwissProt (www.expasy.org/sprot) and other specialized databases such as KEGG [48]. Finally, KEGG hits were used to map EC numbers (http://www.expasy.org/enzyme/), and Interpro hits were used to map GO terms [49]. Predicted proteins also were annotated according to KOG [50], [51] classification.Following the machine annotation, manual validation and correction of selected gene sets was performed by more than 30 annotators through a jamboree held at the JGI facilities in Walnut Creek, California, USA. Annotators were trained by JGI staff and continue to make modifications as necessary.Potential microRNA-like small RNA (milRNAs) loci were annotated using the INFERNAL software tool and based on 454 microRNA families (covarion models) from the RFAM database version 9.1 [52]. milRNAs were predicted if their scores were higher than thresholds, defined individually for each family, in the same way as PFAM domains are predicted.Experimental validation of the predicted milRNAs was done by sequencing of an RNA library Total RNA was isolated from spores germinated on water agar of M. graminicola isolate IPO323. A small RNA library was prepared according to the protocol for Illumina sequencing; small RNAs from 16–∼50 nt were isolated from gels, sequenced with an Illumina/Solexa single read DNA 50 cycles Genome Analyzer II, and compared by BLAST search against the list of 535 predicted pre-milRNAs from the genome sequence.Assembly and annotations of the M. graminicola finished genome are available from the JGI Genome Portal at http://www.jgi.doe.gov/Mgraminicola and were deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the project accession {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""ACPE00000000"",""term_id"":""337271989"",""term_text"":""ACPE00000000""}}ACPE00000000.Whole-genome tiling microarrays were designed by choosing one 50-mer primer every 100 bases spanning the entire finished genome. The arrays were manufactured and hybridized by the Nimblegen Corporation with total DNA extracted from each field isolate.The CodonW package (http://codonw.sourceforge.net/) was used for correspondence analysis of codon usage, which mathematically is identical to principal component analysis. CodonW requires as an input a set of coding sequences, usually of individual genes. For chromosome-level analyses coding sequences from the frozen gene catalog models for each chromosomes were concatenated, forming 21 ‘superORFs’, one for each chromosome. Because partial models may introduce some potential frameshifts with internal stop codons they were removed from the analysis; this did not affect the results as their total number is low. CodonW has no graphical outputs, so they were used as inputs for scatter plots in R (http://www.r-project.org/).For M. graminicola only a similar analysis was done for repeats. RepeatScout was run on the genome to produce a set of ab initio-identified repeat sequences. From that set 81 distinct repeat sequences, each with an occurrence exceeding 20 times in the genome, were extracted. For each chromosome a vector of length 81 was calculated with the relative frequency of each repeat. A PC analysis was run on the resulting vectors using the standard principal component function pcomp in R. Separation at the repeat level means that these chromosomes have distinct evolutionary profiles not only on the protein-coding level, but also on other parts of the chromosomes, suggesting that entire chromosomes may be transferred horizontally.Dot plots were generated via MUMMER 3.0 [53] with data derived from default PROmer comparisons between the M. graminicola genome assembly versions 1 and 2 (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Mycgr3/Mycgr3.home.html) and S. nodorum SN15 assembly version 2 [54], available under GenBank accessions {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide-range"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CH445325-CH445384"",""start_term"":""CH445325"",""end_term"":""CH445384"",""start_term_id"":""62361761"",""end_term_id"":""62361702""}}CH445325-CH445384, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide-range"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CH445386-CH445394"",""start_term"":""CH445386"",""end_term"":""CH445394"",""start_term_id"":""62361700"",""end_term_id"":""62361692""}}CH445386-CH445394 and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide-range"",""attrs"":{""text"":""CH959328-CH959365"",""start_term"":""CH959328"",""end_term"":""CH959365"",""start_term_id"":""111071546"",""end_term_id"":""111071498""}}CH959328-CH959365, or {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""AAGI00000000"",""term_id"":""62183523"",""term_text"":""AAGI00000000""}}AAGI00000000. Additional comparisons and statistical analyses were made with custom-designed perl scripts.Data from the M. graminicola version 2 comparison with S. nodorum were used to test the efficacy of mesosyntenic comparisons to assist the completion of fungal genomes. The mesosynteny-based prediction of scaffold joining involved 3 stages: determining the percent coverage of scaffolds/chromosomes for each scaffold/chromosome pair (i.e., a function of the number of ‘dots’ per ‘block’); determining which scaffold/chromosome pairs were significantly related and forming groups of joined scaffolds; and filtering out background levels of similarity due to sequence redundancy and incomplete genome assemblies.Coordinates of homologous regions were obtained from PROmer coordinate outputs (MUMMER 3.0) and used to determine the percent of sequence covered by matches to a sequence from the alternate genome for each sequence pair. Where match coordinates overlapped on the sequence of interest, those matches were merged into a single feature to avoid redundancy. A perl script for conversion of PROmer coordinate outputs to a table of percent coverage is available on request.Coverage values for each M. graminicola-S. nodorum sequence pair were subject to a binomial test for significance. The threshold for significance (Psig)≥0.95 was:where x is the percent coverage, n equals 100, and p is the probability of chromosome homology.The probability of chromosome homology (p) was equal to 1/(21×19), which was derived from the number of M. graminicola chromosomes (21) and the approximate PFGE estimate of S. nodorum chromosomes (19) [55]. This is the likelihood that a given sequence pair represents related chromosomes. This model assumes that no whole-genome/chromosome duplication events have occurred previously between either fungal genome since divergence from their last common ancestor.The significance of percent coverage (Psig) was tested bidirectionally for each sequence pair (i.e., for sequence pair A–B, both coverage of sequence A by B and coverage of sequence B by A were tested). Sequence pairs were significantly related if a test in either direction was successful. A minimum length threshold of 1 kb was also imposed for both sequences. Where multiple scaffolds of M. graminicola were significantly related to the same S. nodorum scaffold, those M. graminicola scaffolds formed a ‘joined group’ of candidates for representation of the same chromosome.All possible paired combinations of M. graminicola scaffolds present within predicted joined groups were subject to filtering for high levels of background similarity as follows:The retention score is a measure of the reliability of scaffold join relationships. Joins between M. graminicola scaffold pairs with retention scores <0.25 were discarded.Annotation of carbohydrate-related enzymes was performed using the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme database (CAZy) annotation pipeline [26]. BLAST was used to compare the predicted proteins of M. graminicola to a collection of catalytic and carbohydrate-binding modules derived from CAZy. Significant hits were compared individually by BLAST to assign them to one or more CAZy families. Ambiguous family attributions were processed manually along with all identified models that presented defects (deletions, insertions, splicing issues, etc.).Growth profiling of S. nodorum and M. graminicola was on Aspergillus niger minimal medium [56]. Cultures were grown at 25 degrees for seven days after which pictures were taken for growth comparison. Carbon sources used were: glucose (Sigma); soluble starch (Difco); alpha-cellulose (Sigma); Guar Gum (Sigma, galactomannan); Oat spelt xylan (Sigma); and Apple Pectin (Sigma).Comparisons of sequence content between core and dispensable chromosomes was with Circos [57]. This tool draws ribbons connecting sequences that align in different data sets.The method and calculations for using mesosynteny to predict scaffold joins from version 1 to version 2 of the Mycosphaerella graminicola genomic sequence.(XLS)Aspects of the in vitro and in vivo lifestyle of Mycosphaerella graminicola. 1.

A unique gene on chromosome 14 and two on chromosome 18 showed excellent alignments to footprints of genes on chromosome 1. The copies on chromosome 1 matched those on the dispensable chromosomes with an expected value of 1×10−5 or better, but contained numerous stop codons indicating that they were pseudogenes and possibly could have been the progenitor copies for the intact, unique genes on dispensable chromosomes 14 and 18.

PMC3114946,Highly Efficient Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of β1–3-Linked Galactosides,False,"A novel D-galactosyl-β1–3-N-acetyl-D-hexosamine phosphorylase cloned from Bifidobacterium infantis (BiGalHexNAcP) was used with a recombinant E. coli K-12 galactokinase (GalK) for efficient one-pot two-enzyme synthesis of T antigens, galacto-N-biose (Galβ1–3GalNAc), lacto-N-biose (Galβ1–3GlcNAc), and their derivatives.β1–3-Linked galactosides such as galacto-N-biose (GNB, Galβ1–3GalNAc) and lacto-N-biose (LNB, Galβ1–3GlcNAc) are important carbohydrate structures in nature. They are themselves, or are part of, important carbohydrate epitopes involved in cell adhesion, signalling, fertilization, differentiation, development, and cancer metastasis. For example, GNB with an α-configuration at the anomeric carbon of GalNAc (Galβ1–3GalNAcα) is named Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (TF or T-antigen, Galβ1–3GalNAcαSer/Thr) disaccharide. It is the glycan of the Core 1 mucin-type O-GalNAc glycopeptides/glycoproteins and can be branched/extended to form Core 2 as well as extended Core 1 and Core 2 glycans.1 On the other hand, GNB with a β-configuration at the anomeric carbon of GalNAc (Galβ1–3GalNAcβ) is an essential part of the carbohydrate moieties of complex glycosphingolipids such as GA1, GM1, GD1, GT1, GQ1, and GP1, etc. In comparison, LNB is a common structure presented broadly in human milk oligosaccharides (e.g. lacto-N-tetraose and its sialylated/fucosylated derivatives) and in the carbohydrate moieties (e.g. type I glycans, Lewis a, sialyl Lewis a, and Lewis b antigens) of glycoproteins and glycolipids.1,2To use these β1–3-linked galactosides as probes or glycan building blocks for biological studies, GNB and LNB have been synthesized by chemical3 and enzymatic approaches using β-glycosidases4 or β1–3-galactosyltransferases5. Nevertheless, these methods have limitations. Chemical synthesis requires multiple tedious protection-deprotection and purification procedures. Glycosidase-catalyzed reactions usually result in low yields and poor regioselectivity. The formation of β1–3-linked galactosidic bonds usingβ1–3-galactosyltransferases has been proven efficient, but its application is hampered by limited access to sufficient amount of highly efficient glycosyltransferases and the required sugar nucleotide, uridine 5′-diphosphate galactose (UDP-Gal).Carbohydrate phosphorylases catalyze the reversible formation of monosaccharide-1-phosphate from an oligosaccharide or a polysaccharide and an inorganic phosphate. Their ability in catalyzing the reverse reaction has been used for the synthesis of oligosaccharides. Based on their protein sequence similarity, carbohydrate phosphorylases have been grouped into several families of glycoside hydrolases (GH13, GH65, GH94, GH112) and glycosyltransferases (GT3, GT4, GT20, GT35) in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) database (http://www.cazy.org).6 Among them, D-galactosyl-β1–3-N-acetyl-D-hexosamine phosphorylase (GalHexNAcP, EC 2.4.1.211), a member of CAZy glycoside hydrolase GH112 family, was initially reported in Bifidobacterium bifidum DSM 20082 in 1999.7 It reversibly phosphorolyzes GNB and LNB to produce α-D-galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P) and the corresponding N-acetyl-D-hexosamine. The partially purified enzyme (MW: 140 kDa)7 was used in the synthesis of Galβ1–3GlcNAcαOR containing different aglycones with low yields.8 The GalHexNAcP gene was later found in Clostridium perfringens ATCC13124, Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6, and several strains of bifidobacteria and was believed to contribute to the intestinal colonolization of the bacteria.9 The enzyme has been cloned and used with a sucrose phosphorylase, a UDP-glucose-hexose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, and a UDP-glucose 4-epimerase for one-pot four-enzyme high-yield large-scale production of LNB or GNB from sucrose and GlcNAc or GalNAc in the presence of UDP-glucose and phosphate.10Crystal structure of a recombinant GalHexNAcP from Bifidobacterium longum JCM1217 reveals a partially broken TIM barrel fold resembling a thermophilic β-galactosidase.11 Nevertheless, the acceptor substrate specificity of GalHexNAcP has not been studied in detail and its application in efficient synthesis of GNB and LNB derivatives has not been fully explored. Here, we report a highly efficient one-pot two-enzyme approach for the synthesis of diverse β1–3-linked galactosides, including T antigens, GNB, LNB, and their derivatives using a novel D-galactosyl-β1–3-N-acetyl-D-hexosamine phosphorylase cloned from Bifidobacterium infantis (BiGalHexNAcP) and a recombinant galactokinase (GalK) cloned from E. coli K-12.12To obtain BiGalHexNAcP, Blon_2174 gene (GenBank {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""NC_011593"",""term_id"":""213690928"",""term_text"":""NC_011593""}}NC_011593) was amplified from the genomic DNA of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 1569713 by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET15b vector. Optimal expression of the recombinant N-His6-tagged protein (MW: 86.5 kDa) was achieved by incubating E. coli Origami™ B(DE3) cells containing desired plasmids at 25°C for 18–20 hours with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) after the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) (0.1 mM). Ni2+-NTA column purification using an AKTA FPLC system yielded 55 mg pure protein per liter cell culture.As shown in Scheme 1, the synthesis of GNB, LNB, and their derivatives was carried out using a one-pot two-enzyme system containing BiGalHexNAcP and a recombinant E. coli GalK. GalK catalyzed the formation of α-D-Gal-1-P from inexpensive D-Gal in the presence of ATP. The in situ generated α-D-Gal-1-P was used as the donor substrate by the phosphorylase to form diverseβ1–3-linked galactosides. Excess amounts of D-Gal and ATP (1.2 or 1.5 equiv.) were used to drive the reaction towards disaccharide formation.Synthetic scheme for one-pot two-enzyme synthesis of β1–3-linked galactosides. GalK, E. coli K-12 galactokinase; BiGalHexNAcP, Bifidobacterium infantis D-galactosyl-β1–3-N-acetyl-D-hexosamine phosphorylase.HPLC-based pH profile study of BiGalHexNAcP revealed that its catalytic activity was optimum in a relatively narrow pH range of 5.0 to 6.5. Extremely low activity was observed when the pH of the reaction reached 7.0 or higher (see Supporting Information). For GalK, it prefered pH higher than 7.0 for optimum activity, showed medium activity at pH 6.5 and low activity at pH lower than 6.5. Therefore, pH 6.5 was chosen for the one-pot two-enzyme reactions. The reactions were carried out at 37°C for 48 hours. Products were purified using the combination of size exclusion chromatography and silica gel chromatography.As shown in Table 1, BiGalHexNAcP exhibits promiscuous acceptor substrate specificity and has comparable levels of activity toward GlcNAc and GalNAc-based structures. For example, free GlcNAc (1) and GalNAc (11), their β-glycosides (2 and 12 respectively) and α-glycosides (3 and 13 respectively) are superb acceptors for BiGalHexNAcP to produce LNB (21–23) and GNB (31–33) disaccharides in exellent 92–96% yields. Apparently, the configurations of the C-4 hydroxyl group and the anomeric center of the N-acetyl hexosamine do not affect the activity of BiGalHexNAcP.One-pot two-enzyme synthesis of β1–3-linked galactosides from Gal, ATP, and N-acetyl-hexosamine (HexNAc) derivatives using GalK and BiGalHexNAcP.Similarly, N-acetyl group derivatization with small acyl groups or derivatives does not affect the BiGalHexNAcP activity signicantly. For example, GlcNTFA 4 and GalNTFA 14 with an N-trifluoroacetyl group or GlcNAcN3 5 and GalNAcN3 15 with an N-azidoacetyl group in the hexosamines are excellent acceptors to produce disaccharides 24–25 and 34–35 in 91–94% yields. However, bigger N-acyl groups differentiated glucosamine and galactosamine-based acceptors. For example, GlcNPr 6 and GlcNBu 7 with an N-propyl and an N-butyl group, respectively, at glucosamine are good acceptors for BiGalHexNAcP to synthesize disaccharides 26 and 27 in 86% and 78% yields, respectively. The synthetic yield decreases moderately as the size of the N-acyl group on the glucosamine increases. In contrast, the corresponding galactosamine derivative GalNPr 16 leads to disaccharide 36 in a moderate 69% yield while GalNBu 17 is not a suitable acceptor for BiGalHexNAcP. A bulky N-benzoyl group prevents both glucosamine and galactosamine derivatives (8 and 18) from being suitable BiGalHexNAcP acceptors. Quite interestingly, GlcN3 9 and GalN3 19, the C2 derivatives of GlcNAc and GalNAc with the N-acetyl group being replaced by a relatively small azido group (-N3), are not tolerable acceptors.BiGalHexNAcP also shows good tolerance towards C6-modification. Both 6-deoxy-GlcNAc (GlcNAc6Deoxy) 10 and 6-azido-6-deoxy-GlcNAc (GlcNAc6N3) 20 are very good acceptors for the enzyme to synthesize disaccharides 30 and 40 in high yields (84 and 87%, respectively).The BiGalHexNAcP and the one-pot two-enzyme system have also been successfully applied in the efficient synthesis of biologically important T antigens Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-Ser and Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-Thr. As shown in Scheme 2, incubating GalNAcα1-O-Ser 41 or GalNAcα1-O-Thr 42 with Gal and ATP in the presence of GalK and BiGalHexNAcP sucessfully produced the desired disaccharide products 43 and 44 in excellent 92% and 91% yields, respectively.One-pot two-enzyme synthesis of T-antigen Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-O-Ser/Thr.In summary, taking advantage of the acceptor substrate promiscuity of BiGalHexNAcP, we have developed a highly efficient one-pot two-enzyme approach for the synthesis of diverseβ1–3-linked galactosides. Compared to galactosyltransferase-catalyzed approaches, the BiGalHexNAcP-catalyzed reactions do not require the use, in situ generation, or regeneration of expensive sugar nucleotide, and thus are more efficient and simplified systems for producing galactosides. We believe that this synthetic route will contribute greatly to obtaining and elucidating the important roles of β1–3-galactosides as well as β1–3-galactoside-containing glycans and glycoconjugates.This work was supported by NIH grants R01GM076360, U01CA128442 (to X.

PMC3130646,Transcriptomic analysis of Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 cellulose fermentation,False,"The ability of Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain to hydrolyze cellulose and ferment the degradation products directly to ethanol and other metabolic byproducts makes it an attractive candidate for consolidated bioprocessing of cellulosic biomass to biofuels. In this study, whole-genome microarrays were used to investigate the expression of C. thermocellum mRNA during growth on crystalline cellulose in controlled replicate batch fermentations.A time-series analysis of gene expression revealed changes in transcript levels of ~40% of genes (~1300 out of 3198 ORFs encoded in the genome) during transition from early-exponential to late-stationary phase. K-means clustering of genes with statistically significant changes in transcript levels identified six distinct clusters of temporal expression. Broadly, genes involved in energy production, translation, glycolysis and amino acid, nucleotide and coenzyme metabolism displayed a decreasing trend in gene expression as cells entered stationary phase. In comparison, genes involved in cell structure and motility, chemotaxis, signal transduction and transcription showed an increasing trend in gene expression. Hierarchical clustering of cellulosome-related genes highlighted temporal changes in composition of this multi-enzyme complex during batch growth on crystalline cellulose, with increased expression of several genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes involved in degradation of non-cellulosic substrates in stationary phase.Overall, the results suggest that under low substrate availability, growth slows due to decreased metabolic potential and C. thermocellum alters its gene expression to (i) modulate the composition of cellulosomes that are released into the environment with an increased proportion of enzymes than can efficiently degrade plant polysaccharides other than cellulose, (ii) enhance signal transduction and chemotaxis mechanisms perhaps to sense the oligosaccharide hydrolysis products, and nutrient gradients generated through the action of cell-free cellulosomes and, (iii) increase cellular motility for potentially orienting the cells' movement towards positive environmental signals leading to nutrient sources. Such a coordinated cellular strategy would increase its chances of survival in natural ecosystems where feast and famine conditions are frequently encountered.Among cellulolytic microorganisms, the anaerobic, thermophilic, Gram-positive bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum displays one of the fastest growth rates on crystalline cellulose [1,2]. This native cellulolytic organism encodes a repertoire of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) for degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides, which are assembled in large enzyme complexes, termed cellulosomes, on the cell surface [3,4]. C. thermocellum is thus capable of both deconstructing crystalline cellulose into oligomeric cello-oligosaccharides and fermenting the hydrolysis products directly to ethanol and other organic acids, consequently minimizing or eliminating the need for external addition of non-native hydrolytic enzymes. Elimination of a separate cellulase-production step is economically advantageous for industrial cellulosic ethanol production processes [5,6]. C. thermocellum is therefore an attractive candidate microorganism for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels.Several past studies have investigated the expression and regulatory nature of approximately two dozen selected genes encoding cellulosomal catalytic and structural components in C. thermocellum [7-12]. Dror et al. reported growth-rate dependent regulation of cellulosomal endoglucanases (celB, celD, celG) and the major processive endoglucanase celS [7,9]. A growth-rate dependent variation of mRNA levels was also reported for the cellulosome scaffoldin genes cipA and the anchor genes olpB and orf2p but not sdbA [8]. In continuous cultures studies, Zhang and Lynd, using an ELISA method, suggested cellulase synthesis in C. thermocellum to be regulated by a catabolite repression type mechanism [12]. Sparling, Levin and colleagues have investigated the gene expression and enzymatic activities of several proteins involved in pyruvate metabolism and fermentation [13,14].A draft assembly of the C. thermocellum genome sequence became available in 2003, which was subsequently completed and the genome was closed in 2006. This paved the way for whole-genome gene and protein expression studies. We previously reported the construction and evaluation of a whole genome oligo-nucleotide microarray with probes representing ~95% of the open reading frames based on the draft assembly of the C. thermocellum genome sequence [15]. Microarrays are invaluable research tools that provide comprehensive information on the underlying molecular mechanisms for cellular behavior, states and transcriptional regulation. In this study, microarray technology was used to investigate the temporal changes in gene expression associated with fermentation of crystalline cellulose by C. thermocellum.Overall, the gene expression patterns revealed a coordinated response by C. thermocellum to conditions of altering substrate availability during cellulose batch fermentations. C. thermocellum modulates the composition of cellulosomes released into the environment in stationary phase and enhances signal transduction, chemotaxis mechanisms probably for sensing of substrate gradients resulting from the action of cell-free cellulosomes. C. thermocellum also increases expression of genes involved in cellular motility function, potentially to orient the movement of cells towards available nutrient sources in the environment. Such a coordinated cellular strategy should increase its chances of survival under conditions akin to feast and famine that are frequently encountered in natural ecosystems. To our knowledge, this is the first study looking at the transcriptional response of C. thermocellum at a global level and provides the foundation for future research using natural biomass as growth substrates.C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain was a gift from Prof. Herb Strobel at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY. Batch fermentations were conducted in 3 L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2 L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1 g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58°C and 300 rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5 g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3 hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20 hrs) 5 g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.Well-mixed 2 mL aliquots of cultures were harvested at regular intervals and centrifuged quickly to separate into pellet and supernatant samples for protein analysis of pellet fractions and HPLC analysis of extracellular metabolites, respectively. Cell growth was monitored based on increase in protein content within the total solids present in the pellet fraction, including the Avicel® substrate [16]. Briefly, the solid pellet was washed with de-ionized water and the cells were lysed using 0.2N NaOH/1% w/v SDS solution, cell debris were pelleted and removed, and protein concentration in the clear supernatant was estimated using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL). Metabolite analysis was performed using a LaChrom Elite system (Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) equipped with a refractive index detector (Model L-2490). Metabolites were separated at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min in 5 mM H2SO4 using an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA).Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30 mL culture in 50 mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4°C for 10-15 mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1 mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1 mL) was added to a 2 mL tube containing 1 mL of 0.1 mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250°C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500 rpm for 1 min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8 mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200 μL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500 μL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1 mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100 μL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. The 6 hr time-point RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16 hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [17] and microarray slides were scanned in ScanArray Express scanner (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA).Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [15]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis. Signals were quantified in ImaGene version 6.0 (BioDiscovery Inc., El Segundo, CA) and statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6 hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value < 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. Genes significantly up- or down-regulated in at least one time-point comparison were analyzed in TIGR MeV 4.5 software [18] to identify similar temporal trends in gene expression using average-linkage hierarchical or K-means clustering methods.In this study, we investigated the global changes in gene expression associated with fermentation of crystalline cellulose by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum. In order to achieve this, we conducted duplicate 2 L batch fermentations of C. thermocellum on 5 g/L of crystalline cellulose (Avicel®) and took a series of six time-point samples ranging from early-exponential to late-stationary phase of cell growth. Cell growth was monitored based on total cellular protein content in the solid pellet fraction which continued to increase until ~12 h when cells entered stationary phase (Figure ​(Figure1).1). No visible residual Avicel® was found at the end of the fermentation. Metabolite analysis revealed an inversion of acetate-to-ethanol molar ratios over the course of the fermentation, with higher molar levels of acetate than ethanol in the beginning of the fermentation, but the ratio decreased to ~0.7 towards the end of the fermentation (Figure ​(Figure1).1). Unlike earlier reports, no detectable levels of lactate or formate were identified in the fermentations, possibly due to differences in culture conditions. For instance, while lactate and formate were readily detected in batch experiments using Balch tubes with no pH control [19,20], they were formed at very low rates in controlled fermentations in bioreactors with pH control [21]. Moreover, these metabolites may not have been detected in this study possibly due to differences in the detection method (refractive index vs conductivity detector) used in HPLC measurements.Fermentation growth and metabolite production plots. Pellet protein-based growth and metabolite curves for duplicate Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 fermentations on 5 g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel®). Arrows in the upper panel indicate culture sampling points for microarray-based gene expression analysis. Acetate and ethanol data in the lower panel are shown in closed and open symbols, respectively.Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets and the reverse transcribed cDNA was hybridized to oligo-arrays containing duplicated probes representing ~90% of the annotated ORFs in C. thermocellum ATCC27405 genome. Dual-channel dye swap experimental design was used to analyze the time-course of gene expression during cellulose fermentation using the 6 hr sample as the reference, to which all other samples were compared. The entire microarray dataset has been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, [22]) database under accession number {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE29554"",""term_id"":""29554""}}GSE29554 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc={""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE29554"",""term_id"":""29554""}}GSE29554). Data analysis revealed over ~1300 genes that were differentially expressed with statistical significance in at least one time point comparison. This represents ~40% of 3198 ORFs in C. thermocellum showing significant changes in gene expression over the course of cellulose fermentation. Gene expression ratios estimated by microarray methods displayed high correlation with those measured by quantitative RT-PCR, for five representative genes across two different time-points, with an R-value of 0.92 (Additional file 1). Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis of sample datasets revealed clustering of the 6 h exponential sample distinctly from the rest of the time points. Among these were three branches corresponding to late exponential phase (8, 10 h), transition to stationary phase at 12 h and late stationary phase samples (14, 16 h) (data not shown).K-means clustering algorithms were used to group the 967 differentially expressed genes (Additional file 2), excluding 321 genes encoding hypothetical and proteins of unknown function (Additional file 3), into six distinct clusters based on the similarity of their temporal expression profiles (Figure ​(Figure2).2). The six clusters broadly represented mirror-images of three different temporal patterns in gene expression, namely (i) genes which show significant continually increasing or decreasing trends in expression over the entire course of the fermentation (Clusters C1 and C2, respectively), (ii) genes which show a moderate increase or decrease in expression during exponential growth until reaching stationary phase around 12 h but do not change thereafter (C3 and C4, respectively) and (iii) genes which show increase or decrease in expression levels, in particular in late stationary phase at 14, 16 h (C5 and C6, respectively) [Figure ​[Figure2;2; Additional file 2].Temporal expression-based clustering of genes differentially expressed during cellulose fermentation. K-means clustering of genes that were differentially expressed in time-course analysis of transcript level changes during Avicel® fermentation by Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405. Total of 967 genes (excluding 321 genes encoding hypothetical and proteins of unknown function) were clustered into 6 bins based on Euclidean distance using the TIGR MeV® 4.0 software.Genes within each cluster were further classified as per their Clusters-of-Orthologous-Groups (COG) based cellular function and the percentage distribution of genes within each cluster among the different COG categories is shown in Figure ​Figure3.3. The majority of genes in clusters C2, C4 and C6, demonstrated to have moderate to significant decrease in expression in various growth phases during the course of cellulose fermentation, belonged to COG categories with cellular functions related with energy production (COG category C), amino acid (E), nucleotide (F) transport and metabolism, glycolysis (G), coenzyme metabolism (H) and translation, ribosomal structure (J). On the other hand, majority of genes that exhibited increasing trend in gene expression, grouped in clusters C1, C3 and C5, were involved in cellular functions related with cell motility (COG category N; flagellar-, pili-related genes), signal transduction (T), carbohydrate metabolism (G; primarily cellulosome-related genes), transcriptional regulation (K) and DNA recombination including phage-related defense mechanisms (L).Functional distribution of differentially expressed genes within clusters. Calorimetric representation of the percentage distribution of genes, within each of the clusters identified (see Figure 2), across the different Clusters-of-Orthologous-Groups (COG) cellular functional categories. Clusters (C2, C4, C6) and (C1, C3, C5) are clusters in which the genes displayed a decreasing or increasing trend in expression, respectively, in various growth phases during Avicel® fermentation by Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405.The operon structure prediction for C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 by DOOR database ([23]; http://csbl1.bmb.uga.edu/OperonDB/) was used to estimate the correlation for co-regulation of genes in contiguous regions of the genome within predicted operons. Overall there was significant correlation between the total number of genes and the number of genes differentially expressed in a predicted operon that exhibited co-regulated patterns in expression with either concerted increase (9 operons, R-value 0.97) or decrease (30 operons, R-value 0.81-0.96) in transcript levels (data not shown). Examples included two large predicted operons, Cthe0480-0496 (17 ORFs) and Cthe2908-2928 (21 ORFs), in which 14 and 13 genes were differentially expressed, respectively. The former operon, containing several genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis, pili assembly, chemotaxis and signal transduction, displayed an increasing trend in expression while the latter operon, containing genes encoding several large and small ribosomal subunit proteins, showed a progressively decreasing trend in expression over the course of cellulose fermentation.In general, genes involved in the glycolysis pathway for conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) either had no change in expression or displayed decreased expression during stationary phase of growth and belonged to clusters C2, C4 and C6 (Figure ​(Figure4,4, Additional file 4: Expression of genes upstream of PEP). Both copies of phosphofructokinase (Cthe0347 and Cthe1261), a key regulated enzyme in the Embden-Meyerhoff pathway, showed 1.5-2 fold lowered expression in stationary phase (Figure ​(Figure4).4). C. thermocellum has multiple homologues of several metabolic enzymes encoded in the genome, including seven copies of phosphoglycerate mutase involved in the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate. Among these, Cthe0140 had maximal expression throughout the fermentation, Cthe1292 and Cthe0946 displayed regulated expression, while the other four copies displayed relatively minimal expression during cellulose fermentation (Figure ​(Figure44).Expression of genes involved in cellodextrin transport and catabolism during cellulose fermentation.

Heat plot representation of transcript expression [as Log2 (array signal intensity)] for genes (known and putative) involved in cellodextrin transport and hydrolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, glycolytic conversion of glucose to pyruvate and anaerobic fermentation of pyruvate to organic acids (formate, lactate, acetate) and ethanol, over the course of Avicel® fermentation by Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405. Cellulosome schematic is an adaptation of the image from the U.S. Department of Energy Genome Programs website image gallery (http://genomics.energy.gov; [40]);one black circle - Cthe0506 is pfl-activating enzyme; two black circles - Cthe0423 encodes a bi-functional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme involved in direct conversion of acetyl-CoA to ethanol; open diamond - Microarray data is not available.The pentose phosphate pathway is important for production and supply of key intermediates involved in the synthesis of nucleotides and aromatic amino acids. The C. thermocellum genome encodes several enzymes in the non-oxidative branch of the Pentose Phosphate (PP) pathway including ribulose-5-P isomerase (Cthe2597) and ribulose-5-P epimerase (Cthe0576) (Figure ​(Figure4,4, Additional file 4). During cellulose fermentation, the epimerase gene was downregulated by up to 2-fold in stationary phase, while the isomerase gene was expressed at high levels throughout the course of the fermentation. C. thermocellum also has two pairs of contiguous genes encoding transketolases (Cthe2443-44 and Cthe2704-05) which catalyze several reactions in the PP pathway, of which only the Cthe2704-05 pair shows maximal expression during cellulose fermentation (Figure ​(Figure4).4). Sequence homology-based annotation has however not revealed a transaldolase in C. thermocellum.Similar to glycolytic enzymes, a majority of the genes involved in conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate and mixed-acid fermentation of pyruvate to various organic acids and ethanol were downregulated during stationary phase of C. thermocellum growth on cellulose (Figure ​(Figure4,4, Additional file 5: Expression of genes downstream of PEP). Several Gram-positive organisms, including representatives in the Clostridial species such as C. phytofermentans and C. cellulolyticum, encode genes for pyruvate phosphate kinase, which catalyzes the conversion of PEP to pyruvate, but genome annotation has not identified a homologous gene in C. thermocellum. An ORF recently suggested as a putative pyruvate kinase homologue, Cthe1955 [24], had relatively minimal expression during cellulose fermentation (Figure ​(Figure4).4). C. thermocellum however has two copies of the gene encoding pyruvate phosphate dikinase (Cthe1253 and Cthe1308), which catalyzes the reverse reaction for conversion of pyruvate to PEP. This enzyme is suggested to play an anabolic role in gluconeogenesis and consistent with this, Cthe1253 is upregulated in stationary phase during growth on cellulose. Sparling and colleagues have proposed an alternate route for conversion of PEP to pyruvate via oxaloacetate and malate (Figure ​(Figure4;4; Sparling, personal communication). Genes encoding all three enzymes in this alternative route, the gluconeogenic PEP carboxykinase (Cthe2874), malate dehydrogenase (Cthe0345), and malic enzyme (Cthe0344), were expressed at high levels, suggesting that this putative pathway is active in C. thermocellum during growth on cellulose.C. thermocellum contains two clusters of genes (Cthe2390-2393 and Cthe2794-2797) encoding the gamma, delta, alpha and beta subunits, respectively, of the thiamine-pyrophosphate (TPP) dependent pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR) which catalyzes the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. While all the genes in the Cthe2390-2393 cluster displayed maximal expression during cellulose fermentation, only a single gene in the Cthe2794-2797 cluster, encoding the TPP-binding beta subunit of the POR protein complex (Cthe2797), had high transcript levels which decreased in stationary phase (Figure ​(Figure4).4). This is in contrast to studies by Sparling and colleagues who reported expression of Cthe2794-97 transcripts by RT-PCR during log phase of growth on alpha-cellulose with only weak expression of the Cthe2390-93 cluster [13]. However, the observed trends in gene expression may be due to differences in culture conditions between the two studies. While qPCR analysis was done with batch cultures in Balch tubes with no pH control [13], microarray analysis in this study was conducted with samples from controlled fermentations in bioreactors with pH control.C. thermocellum encodes several genes involved in the mixed-acid fermentation pathways for conversion of pyruvate to organic acids (lactate, formate, acetate) and ethanol (Additional file 5, Expression of genes downstream of PEP). These include two putative lactate dehydrogenase genes (ldh; Cthe0345, Cthe1053) involved in conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Previous studies have reported detecting LDH activity in cell extracts of C. thermocellum [14,25,26] and RT-PCR analysis has shown expression of both ldh genes during cellulose batch and continuous fermentations [11,13]. LDH, Cthe1053, cloned and expressed in E. coli, has been functionally characterized and demonstrated to oxidize pyruvate to lactate [27]. In this study, the Cthe1053 gene displayed low expression and lactate was not detected during cellulose fermentation. Although another gene annotated as ldh (Cthe0345) was expressed at high levels, this may be related to the participation of the encoded enzyme as a malate dehydrogenase in the alternate route for conversion of PEP to pyruvate, as discussed earlier (Figure ​(Figure4).4). Pyruvate formate lyase (pfl) catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to formate, along with the formation of acetyl-CoA. Sparling et al, reported formate synthesis in C. thermocellum via this pathway with detection of transcripts for pfl (Cthe0505) and the pfl activating enzyme (Cthe0506) by RT-PCR [13]. In this study, two out of four putative pfl activating enzymes (Cthe0506, Cthe0647) were expressed at relatively high levels during cellulose fermentation (Additional file 5; data not available for pfl, Cthe0505). However, formate was not detectable in the culture supernatant consistent with other previous reports [25,28].Acetyl-CoA is further catabolized to acetate with generation of ATP or to ethanol with reoxidation of NADH. C. thermocellum encodes an NADH-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldH, Cthe2238), which catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetaldehyde, and several iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenases (Cthe0101, Cthe0394 [adhY] and Cthe2579 [adhZ]) for alcohol synthesis from acetaldehyde; also encoded is a bi-functional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (Cthe0423, adhE) which catalyzes the direct conversion of acetyl-CoA to ethanol (Figure ​(Figure4).4). AdhE has been proposed to be a key enzyme for ethanol synthesis in C. thermocellum and transcription of adhE, adhY and adhZ has been confirmed by RT-PCR analysis in cellobiose and cellulose cultures of C. thermocellum [11,19]. In this study, the aldH gene showed increased expression during stationary phase while the three adh genes, Cthe0394, Che0423 and Cthe0101, were actively expressed during cellulose batch fermentation with the latter showing decreased expression in stationary phase (Figure ​(Figure4,4, Additional file 5).Acetyl-CoA is indirectly converted to acetate via acetyl-phosphate through the action of two enzymes, encoded by the contiguous genes, phosphotransacetylase (pta, Cthe1029) and acetate kinase (ack, Cthe1028), with the generation of one ATP per acetate molecule. The reverse reaction for direct conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA utilizes ATP and is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs, Cthe0551). Previous studies have confirmed the expression of acetate kinase through RT-PCR [11] and enzyme activity measurements [25]. In this study, both pta and ack genes were expressed at low levels which further decreased in stationary phase; whereas, the acs gene was expressed at relatively higher levels over the entire course of the fermentation (Figure ​(Figure4,4, Additional file 5). The observed gene expression patterns are consistent with our metabolite analysis of the fermentation medium, which showed decreasing acetate-to-ethanol molar ratios during entry into stationary phase (Figure ​(Figure1).1). Several genes involved in conversion of pyruvate to other intermediate metabolites such as α-ketoglutarate, which is a building block for amino acid and nucleic acid biosynthesis, also showed high level of expression during active growth but lowered levels in stationary phase (Additional file 5), possibly due to reduced metabolic need under slow growth and nutrient-limited conditions.Overall, the genes involved in maintaining the intracellular redox conditions and cellular energy production systems belonged to clusters C2, C4 and C6 and were downregulated with decreasing growth rate over the course of cellulose batch fermentation (Additional file 6, Expression of genes involved with energy generation and redox balance).C. thermocellum uses the hydrogenase-mediated pathway for production of molecular hydrogen to dispose the excess reducing equivalents generated during carbohydrate catabolism. Putative hydrogenases encoded in the C. thermocellum genome include, (i) Ferredoxin-dependent Ech-type NiFe-hydrogenase (Cthe3013-3024), (ii) two NADH-dependent Fe-only hydrogenases (Cthe0338-0343 and Cthe0426-0430) and (iii) NADPH-dependent Fe-only hydrogenase (Cthe3003-3004) [13,14]. Ech hydrogenase and NADH:Ferredoxin oxidoreductase (rnf, Cthe2430-2435) complexes reoxidize the ferredoxin reduced during POR catalyzed conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (Figure ​(Figure5).5). In the process, the complexes pump H+/Na+ ions across the cell membrane and create proton gradients for powering ATP synthesis by ATP synthase and H+/Na+ transporting ATPase complexes encoded in genomic regions, Cthe2602-2609 and Cthe2262-2269, respectively. Carera et al. [13] demonstrated transcription of representative genes in these hydrogenase complexes using RT-PCR and Rydzak et al. [14] reported detecting activities from all three classes of hydrogenases during growth on cellobiose. In this study, we observed significant expression of genes encoding NADH-, and NADPH-dependent hydrogenases and relatively lower expression of Ech hydrogenase during active growth phase of cellulose fermentation. Expression of hydrogenase and ATP synthase genes was downregulated by up to 2.5-fold in stationary phase with the exception of the hypD (Cthe3014) gene, encoding the hydrogenase formation protein, which exhibited a 3-fold increase in expression (Figure ​(Figure5;5; Additional file 6). Genes involved in maintaining cellular reduction-oxidation status have been demonstrated to be important metabolic engineering targets for increasing solvent yields in thermophilic anaerobes [29]. A recent genome-scale metabolic model of C. thermocellum predicted a 15-fold increase in maximum ethanol production resulting from deletion of hydrogenase gene, Cthe3003 [24].Expression of genes involved in maintaining cellular REDOX status. Heat plot representation of transcript expression [as Log2 (array signal intensity)] for genes (known and putative) involved in cellular reduction and oxidation reactions, co-factor recycling, hydrogen production and ATP synthesis, over the course of Avicel® fermentation by Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405; open diamond - Microarray data is not available.In C. thermocellum, cellulases and other polysaccharide degrading enzymes are assembled together in large protein complexes, termed the cellulosome, on the cell-surface. The cellulosome complex has a primary scaffoldin protein, CipA, containing 9 type-I cohesin-modules and catalytic subunits, each containing a complementary type-I dockerin module, interact strongly with the cohesin module for assembly onto the scaffoldin. CipA with bound enzymes is in turn attached to the cell surface via interaction between the CipA-borne type-II dockerin and type-II cohesins of the cell wall anchor proteins. During growth on insoluble substrates, the cells are tightly attached to the substrate via the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) borne by CipA and many catalytic subunits of the cellulosomes forming a cell-cellulosome-carbohydrate complex.C. thermocellum genome has revealed the presence of more than 70 catalytic subunits containing type-I dockerin and 8 non-catalytic structural components ([30]; Additional file 7, Expression of cellulosomal and non-cellulosomal CAZyme genes). Recent studies have provided evidence for the functional expression of more than 65 cellulosome components in C. thermocellum at the protein level. Quantitative proteomic analysis of cellulosomes isolated from C. thermocellum cultures grown on different carbon sources revealed a substrate-dependent regulation of catalytic subunit distribution in cellulosomes [16,31]. In this study, during growth of C. thermocellum on crystalline cellulose, a temporally regulated pattern of changes in cellulosomal composition was observed at the transcript level (Figure ​(Figure6,6, Additional file 7). Among 20 catalytic subunit genes with the highest expression at transcript-level (this study) and protein-level (previous study, [16]), 12 genes were common suggesting significant correlation between the two measurements (data not shown). Cellulosomal and other CAZyme genes were primarily grouped in clusters C1, C3 and C5 which showed upregulated expression during different phases of cellulose fermentation (Figures ​(Figures2,2, ​,33).Cellulosomal genes differentially expressed during cellulose fermentation. Heat plot representation of Log2 (Differential Expression Ratio) and hierarchical clustering of cellulosomal genes showing statistically significant differences in transcript expression over the course of Avicel® fermentation by Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405. Domain key: GH = Glycoside Hydrolase, CE = Carbohydrate Esterase, PL = Polysaccharide Lyase, CBM = Carbohydrate Binding Module, Unk = unknown, based on the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (http://www.cazy.org; [41])Structural cellulosome components include the scaffoldin CipA (Cthe3077) and seven anchor proteins, five containing type-II cohesins (Cthe1307/SdbA, Cthe 3078/OlpB, Cthe3079/Orf2p, Cthe0735 and Cthe0736) and two containing type-I cohesin (Cthe3080/OlpA, Cthe0452). Among these, genes encoding CipA, Orf2p, OlpB and OlpA exhibited maximal expression during cellulose fermentation (Additional file 7). Expression of orf2p increased by up to 2-fold over the course of the batch fermentation in agreement with Dror et al. who reported an inverse correlation between growth rate and mRNA levels of the anchor genes, olpB, orf2p and the scaffoldin cipA [8]. However, in this study, expression levels of cipA did not change significantly during batch growth and olpB displayed a moderate decrease in expression in stationary phase (Figure ​(Figure6,6, Additional file 7).Catalytic cellulosome subunits display a wide range of hydrolytic capabilities including endo-, exo-glucanases, hemicellulases, and pectinases, among other enzymatic activities [3]. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes revealed increased expression of several catalytic components over the course of cellulose fermentation (Figure ​(Figure6).6). In agreement with an earlier study reporting a growth rate dependent regulation of the endoglucanases belonging to GH5 (celB, celG) and GH9 (celD) families [9], expression of these genes increased with decreasing growth rate, with peak expression at 12 or 14h into the fermentation. However, the celS GH48 family processive exoglucanase, also reported to be growth-rate regulated [7], showed a statistically insignificant increase in expression over time (Figure ​(Figure6,6, Additional file 7). In addition to the cellulosomal enzymes, C. thermocellum genome encodes sequences for 35 non-cellulosomal CAZymes (no dockerin domain; Additional file 7), which were also differentially expressed during cellulose fermentation (Figure ​(Figure7).7). For example, members of the GH94 family, involved in intracellular phosphorolytic cleavage of cellodextrin and cellobiose, were downregulated as substrate availability decreased over the course of the fermentation. Whereas, two non-cellulosomal enzymes encoded by contiguous genes, Cthe1256-1257, exhibited increased expression by up to 4-fold in stationary phase.Non-cellulosomal genes differentially expressed during cellulose fermentation. Heat plot representation of Log2 (Differential Expression Ratio) and hierarchical clustering of non-cellulosomal CAZyme genes showing statistically significant differences in transcript expression over the course of Avicel® fermentation by Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405. Domain key: GH = Glycoside Hydrolase, CE = Carbohydrate Esterase, PL = Polysaccharide Lyase, CBM = Carbohydrate Binding Module, Unk = unknown, based on the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (http://www.cazy.org; [41])Newcomb and Wu [32] characterized a LacI family transcriptional regulator, GlyR3 (Cthe2808), in C. thermocellum that was shown to regulate the expression of two non-cellulosomal CAZymes, a GH16 family lichinase (licA, Cthe2809) and a GH5 family cellulase (celC, Cthe2807), all encoded together in the putative celC operon, Cthe2807-2809. During cellulose fermentation, genes in this operon displayed relatively little expression in exponential phase but their transcript levels continually increased with maximal expression of >3-fold in stationary phase (Figure ​(Figure7,7, Additional file 7). Mishra et al. also observed a similar expression pattern during cellobiose fermentation in which celC transcripts were detected exclusively in early stationary phase after cessation of growth [10]. Differential expression of the operon in the absence of laminaribiose, the identified GlyR3 inducer [32], suggests that other cellulose-derived oligosaccharides may also act as inducers or other regulatory mechanisms may be involved.Recent evidence suggests the possible role of membrane-associated anti-sigma factors in extracellular carbohydrate-sensing and CAZyme gene regulation in C. thermocellum. Kahel-Raifer et al. identified several putative bicistronic operons in the C. thermocellum genome, each operon encoding an RsgI-like anti-σ factor and a putative alternative sigma factor σI (SigI) and proposed a regulatory model, wherein RsgI senses the presence of biomass components in the extracellular medium via its CBM domain while SigI mediates the intracellular activation of appropriate CAZyme genes that are necessary for hydrolysis of the polysaccharide substrate, in response to the transmitted signal [33]. In this study, three of the σI encoding genes (Cthe0058, Cthe0268, Cthe0403) that are associated with anti-σI -like genes bearing cellulose-binding CBM3 domains were all upregulated, with Cthe0268 showing ~5-fold increased expression, during later stages of the cellulose fermentation (Additional file 8: Expression of genes involved in carbohydrate sensing and CAZyme regulation). The observed pattern in expression of CBM3-related σI genes, i.e., their increased expression in stationary phase, seems to differ from the regulatory model proposed by Kahel-Raifer et al., who suggested induced expression of sigma factor in the presence of the polysaccharide substrate [33]. This is probably explained by the presence of residual Avicel in the stationary phase or perhaps suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms, such as growth rate, in the regulation of sigI genes. However, several genes encoding GH9 family cellulases (Cthe0043/CelN, Cthe0413/CbhA, Cthe0543/CelF, Cthe0745/CelW, Cthe2812/CelT etc.) were also upregulated with peak expression in early-to-late stationary phase (Additional file 7) and are potentially part of SigI regulon in C. thermocellum.Several of the cellulosomal CAZymes with significant upregulated expression in later stages of fermentation belonged to GH families with hydrolytic capabilities specializing in degradation of non-cellulolytic substrates - for example, GH26 family mannanases (Cthe0032, manA/Cthe2811), GH74 family xyloglucanase (xghA/Cthe1398), Family 11 pectate lyase (Cthe0246), GH10 and GH11 family xylanases (xynY/Cthe0912, xynA-U/Cthe2972), bi-functional CelH (Cthe1472) containing GH5 and GH26 domains etc. (Figure ​(Figure6,6, Additional file 7). Given that C. thermocellum releases the cellulosomes in stationary phase [34], it is likely that the increased expression of non-cellulolytic GH family enzymes during the latter part of growth is aimed towards enriching this population of enzymes in the free cellulosomes to aid in exposing the preferred substrate of cellulose from untapped resources in the cellular vicinity. Increase in expression of the two serine protease inhibitor components (Cthe0190, Cthe0191) may serve to protect the free cellulosomes from proteolytic degradation.Ten percent of the ORFs in the C. thermocellum genome encode proteins that are involved in transport of oligosaccharides, amino acids, inorganic and metal ions, co-factors etc. C. thermocellum has been reported to use ABC-type systems for transport of oligosaccharides derived from cellulose hydrolysis [35]. Recently, Shoham and colleagues characterized several ABC sugar binding proteins in C. thermocellum (CbpA, Cthe0393; CbpB, Cthe1020; CbpC, Cthe2128; CbpD, Cthe2446) based on their affinity to glucose and G2-G5 cello-oligosaccharides [36]. In this study, genes in contiguous regions (Cthe0391-0393 and Cthe1019-1020) encoding CbpA and CbpB proteins with binding affinities to G3 and G2-G5 beta-1,4-glycans, respectively, and Cthe1862, encoding another sugar binding protein of unknown specificity, were expressed at high levels throughout the course of cellulose fermentation (Figure ​(Figure4).4). This observation is consistent with the study by Zhang and Lynd demonstrating the preference of C. thermocellum for importing 4-glucose-unit chains during growth on cellulose. The bioenergetic implications of importing long cellodextrins are two-fold, (i) from reduced cost of transport as only one-ATP molecule is needed per transport event irrespective of the chain length and (ii) additional energetic advantage from phosphorolytic cleavage of the imported oligosaccharides [37].The majority of genes involved in flagellar- and pili-based cell motility and chemotaxis-based signal transduction mechanisms displayed an increasing trend in expression over the course of cellulose fermentation. Approximately, 81% of all differentially expressed (DE) genes belonging to COG category N (motility-related) and 64% of all DE genes belonging to COG category T (signal transduction) were grouped to clusters C1, C3 and C5, which contain genes showing increased expression in various stages of growth (Figures ​(Figures2,2, ​,3).3). In C. thermocellum, many of the genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis/assembly and two-component signal transduction are clustered in a genomic region containing ORFs ranging from Cthe0462-0496. Several genes in this region, within putative operons Cthe0462-0464 (all 3 genes) and Cthe0480-0496 (14 out of 17 genes), were coordinately upregulated during cellulose fermentation. Many genes in another genomic region, Cthe1100-1107, encoding fimbrial assembly and type II secretion system proteins, also showed increased expression by up to 3-fold during growth. These results suggest potentially increased motility of C. thermocellum during later stages of the fermentation. This is in contrast to reports of decreased expression of flagellar and chemotaxis genes in solventogenic members of the clostridia, C. beijerinckii [38] and C. acetobutylicum [39] during shift from acidogenic to solventogenic phase or at the onset of sporulation, respectively. In C. thermocellum, upregulated expression of motility- and chemotaxis-related genes under conditions of low substrate availability, suggest a cellular strategy oriented towards enhancing the ability of cells to sense the environment and appropriately respond to the ambient signals through activation of the cellular motility systems.Due to its native cellulolytic capability and ability to ferment cellulose hydrolysis products directly to ethanol, Clostridium thermocellum is an attractive candidate microorganism for consolidate bioprocessing of plant biomass to biofuels. Understanding the microbial physiology associated with cellulase synthesis, cellulose degradation, and cellular growth is vital to identifying genetic targets for manipulation and strain improvement. In this study, we probed C. thermocellum gene expression during the course of cellulose fermentation using whole genome microarray technology. Time course analysis of gene expression coupled with clustering of genes with similar temporal patterns in expression revealed an overall decrease in metabolic potential of the organism over the course of the fermentation. Several genes involved in energy production, translation, glycolysis and amino acid, nucleotide and coenzyme metabolism displayed a progressively decreasing trend in gene expression. In comparison, genes involved in cell structure and motility, chemotaxis, signal transduction, transcription and cellulosomal genes displayed an increasing trend in gene expression.While growth-rate related changes in cell growth and metabolism genes have been well documented, the increasing trend in expression of CAZyme genes, especially when the overall energy and protein synthesis capacity of the cells is at its minimal throughput in the stationary phase is rather surprising. This might denote a cellular strategy to channel the available resources towards the cellulolytic machinery, thereby increasing its chances of finding new sources of nutrition. During active growth, the cellulosome complex is tightly adhered to the cell surface and also to the solid substrate forming a tri-complex between cells, cellulosome and cellulose. But, when growth begins to slow-down, C. thermocellum is known to release the cellulosomes into the culture medium [34], perhaps through sensing the decreasing supply of oligosaccharides. The released cellulosomes could then act as 'deployed soldiers in the battlefield,' whereby they are free to diffuse and 'hunt' for alternate sources of nutrients in the environment. Increasing the expression of non-cellulolytic enzymes and thus modulating the composition of the released cellulosomes would enhance the chances for successfully 'un-wrapping' the preferred substrate of cellulose from other plant polysaccharides such as hemicellulose and pectin. However, it is not yet known if there are distinct differences in the composition of the attached vs the detached cellulosomes in C. thermocellum and warrants further study.In conjunction with changes in potential composition of cellulosome and its release, increase in motility and signal transduction capability of the cells in stationary phase further highlights the evolution of this organism to feast and famine conditions in nature. If we assume that the cells release the cellulosomes in search of alternate nutrient sources, then it would be advantageous to correspondingly enhance the cells' ability to sense the oligomeric degradation products resulting from the activity of cellulosomes, although such mechanisms are currently unknown in this organism. Similarly, altering gene expression to improve cellular motility systems would help in appropriately orienting the cells' movement towards the nutrient gradient of interest. Hence the observed increase in expression of flagellar genes and chemotaxis genes is likely linked to adaptation and survival under famine conditions. Relatively little is understood about nutrient sensing mechanisms and the genes that are regulated in response to such senses in C. thermocellum. To our knowledge, this is the first global whole cell gene expression study in C. thermocellum, which enhances the current understanding of C. thermocellum physiological changes during cellulose fermentation and also lays the foundation for future studies with natural biomass.BR, SDB and JRM conceived and designed the study; CKM carried out the growth studies; MR carried out the metabolite analysis; BR conducted the fermentations, carried out the microarray studies, statistical data analysis and drafted the manuscript with input from JRM and SDB.

PMC3133124,"Evidence that WapB Is a 1,2-Glucosyltransferase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Involved in Lipopolysaccharide Outer Core Biosynthesis▿†",False,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen infecting debilitated individuals. One of the major virulence factors expressed by P. aeruginosa is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is composed of lipid A, core oligosaccharide (OS), and O-antigen polysaccharide. The core OS is divided into inner and outer regions. Although the structure of the outer core OS has been elucidated, the functions and mechanisms of the glycosyltransferases involved in core OS biogenesis are currently unknown. Here, we show that a previously uncharacterized gene, pa1014, is involved in outer core biosynthesis, and we propose to rename this gene wapB. We constructed a chromosomal mutant, wapB::Gm, in a PAO1 (O5 serotype) strain background. Characterization of the LPS from the mutant by Western immunoblotting showed a lack of reactivity to PAO1 outer core-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) 5c-101. The chemical structure of the core OS of the wapB mutant was elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry techniques and revealed that the core OS of the wapB mutant lacked the terminal β-1,2-linked-d-glucose residue. Complementation of the mutant with wapB in trans restored the core structure to one that is identical to that of the wild type. Eleven of the 20 P. aeruginosa International Antigenic Typing Scheme (IATS) serotypes produce LPSs that lack the terminal d-glucose residue (GlcIV). Interestingly, expressing wapB in each of these 11 serotypes modifies each of their outer core OS structures, which became reactive to MAb 5c-101 in Western immunoblotting, suggesting the presence of a terminal d-glucose in these core OS structures. Our results strongly suggested that wapB encodes a 1,2-glucosyltransferase.Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ubiquitous in the environment and generally regarded as a saprophyte, but it is also an important opportunistic human and animal pathogen (34). This bacterium can cause a variety of infections including some unusual ones, such as green nail syndrome associated with the use of community pools (17) and keratitis associated with the use of contact lenses (37), but mainly it infects compromised individuals, such as AIDS patients and those with burn wounds and cystic fibrosis (CF). For CF patients, P. aeruginosa is the major cause of morbidity and mortality (11, 32). P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium and possesses lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a major constituent of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. LPS also serves as one of its major virulence factors (7, 30). Due to its proximity in the bacterial outer envelope, LPS plays crucial roles in maintaining structural integrity and interacting with the environment. P. aeruginosa LPS is composed of three distinct regions: (i) lipid A, the endotoxic moiety that anchors the LPS molecule in the outer membrane; (ii) the core oligosaccharide (OS); and (iii) the long-chain O polysaccharides (or O antigen) that consist of different repeated sugar units. These features segregate P. aeruginosa strains into 20 International Antigenic Typing Scheme (IATS) serotypes.The core oligosaccharide (OS) can be divided into inner and outer regions. The inner core is conserved among Gram-negative bacteria and is composed of two 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) and two l-glycero-d-manno-heptose (ld-Hep) residues. The outer core region is more species specific, and in the case of P. aeruginosa, it contains one l-rhamnose (l-Rha) and one N-(l-alanyl)-d-galactosamine and either three or four d-glucose (d-Glc) residues. A single P. aeruginosa cell simultaneously produces two distinct core OS glycoforms. The first glycoform is capped, meaning that it is covalently attached to O antigen, while the second, uncapped core is devoid of O antigen. Besides the presence or absence of an O antigen, the two core glycoforms differ in the outer core region, particularly in the position and linkage of L-Rha, and in the presence/absence of a terminal Glc residue (GlcIV) (Fig. 1). The basic core OS structure is conserved among different P. aeruginosa strains; however, variations can be observed in the presence of GlcIV in uncapped outer core and noncarbohydrate substituents (such as phosphorylation of Hep residues or acetylation on certain sugar residues of the core). Immunochemical data produced by our group (9) and the structural elucidation of core OS reported by Bystrova et al. (2) revealed that only 9 out of the 20 IATS serotypes (O2, O5, O7, O8, O10, O16, O18, O19, and O20) reacted with outer core-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) 5c-101, and the elucidated core OS structures of these serotypes possess terminal GlcIV. Although the chemical structures of the core OS of the wild-type PAO1 strain and the IATS serotypes (2) have been elucidated, knowledge of how outer core residues are transferred to synthesize the core is lacking. We reported earlier that MigA and WapR are two putative rhamnosyltransferases associated with outer core OS biosynthesis, and these two enzymes share 35% identity. Analysis of LPS from migA::Gm and wapR::Gm mutants suggested that WapR is the α-1,3-rhamnosyltransferase that adds the l-Rha residue to the core, which then becomes the proper acceptor for the attachment of O antigen, whereas MigA is the α-1,6-rhamnosyltransferase required for the assembly of the uncapped core glycoform (26). Other putative outer core glycosyltransferases are WapH and WapG, potentially transferring GlcII and GalN, respectively. However, their functions remain hypothetical since the LPS structure of a wapH mutant has not been determined, and a wapG mutant could not be constructed even though various strategies were used (23). Apparently, wapG is an essential gene, and mutation in this gene is lethal. Based on homology to MigA and WapR, we hypothesized that the product of the uncharacterized pa1014 gene is also involved in outer core OS biosynthesis. To conform to the widely accepted LPS gene nomenclature and be consistent with other genes associated with core OS biosynthesis as wap* genes (18, 27), we propose to name pa1014 as wapB. We have constructed a chromosomal wapB::Gm mutant in the PAO1 strain (O5 serotype) background, and LPS prepared from this mutant was characterized by Western immunoblotting, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry (MS). The outer core OS of the mutant lacked a terminal 1,2-linked GlcIV residue, suggesting that WapB is a 1,2-glucosyltransferase. We further substantiated this by showing that expression of WapB in all 11 Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotypes lacking the terminal GlcIV residue confers a Glc substitution on their outer core OS structures that is recognized by the outer core-specific monoclonal antibody 5c-101. This indicated that WapB can be functional in all P. aeruginosa serotypes.Structures of the two distinct outer core OSs that are simultaneously produced by a single P. aeruginosa PAO1 cell. (A) Uncapped core OS is devoid of O antigen and contains an α-1,6-linked l-Rha and 1, 2-linked d-GlcIV. (B) Capped core OS is has a substitution of O polysaccharide through an α-1,3-linked l-Rha. GalN, galactosamine; Ala, alanine; Rha, rhamnose; Glc, glucose. Putative glycosyltransferases MigA, WapR, and WapB required for transfer of RhaA, RhaB, and GlcIV, respectively, are depicted by arrowheads (adapted from references 18 and 26).The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Bacterial strains were grown in lysogeny broth (LB; also commonly known as Luria-Bertani medium) (Invitrogen) at 37°C. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: for Escherichia coli strains, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 15 μg/ml gentamicin, and 15 μg/ml tetracycline; and for P. aeruginosa strains, 300 μg/ml carbenicillin, 150 μg/ml gentamicin, and 90 μg/ml tetracycline.Bacterial strains and plasmids usedPrimers were prepared by Sigma Genosys. PCR was performed according to the KOD hot start procedure (Novagen). Restriction enzymes, Klenow fragment, and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England BioLabs. All enzymes were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Chemically competent E. coli DH5α cells were prepared using the rubidium chloride method outlined by New England BioLabs (24). Constructs were routinely transformed into P. aeruginosa strains using the benchtop method (6). Nucleotide sequences of all constructs were verified by the Laboratory Services Division at the University of Guelph (Guelph, Ontario, Canada).A chromosomal mutant of wapB was constructed by a gene replacement strategy using the aac(3) gene cassette encoding aminoglycoside acetyltransferase that confers resistance to gentamicin (Gm), as described by Schweizer and Hoang (28). Specifically, the wapB gene was amplified from the genome of P. aeruginosa PAO1 with the following primers: 14MF, GGGTGGTCGTCCCGCTCTG, and 14MR, CAGGGCGAGGCACTGAAGGAG. The amplified gene was inserted into the HincII site of pUC18 to obtain plasmid pUCwapB. A Flp recognition target (FRT)-Gmr-FRT cassette excised from the plasmid pPS856 (16) using SacI was blunt ended with Klenow fragment (NEB). This fragment was then inserted into the unique HincII site of the gene wapB in plasmid pUCwapB. The replacement vector pEXwapB Gm was constructed by insertion of the disrupted allele wapB::Gm into the SphI and XmaI sites of the plasmid pEX18AP (16). The pEXwapB Gm vector was then conjugated from E. coli SM10 to P. aeruginosa PAO1 according the method described by de Lorenzo and Timmis (10). Single recombination mutants were selected on Difco Pseudomonas isolation agar (BD Biosciences) with 300 μg/ml of carbenicillin. These mutants were then streaked on LB agar with gentamicin and 7% sucrose to select for bacteria that had undergone double recombination. PCR was performed to confirm that allelic exchange between the chromosomal wild-type wapB and the wapB::Gm had occurred.Construction of a complementation vector. The wapB gene was PCR amplified by the primer pair wapB_F/Xba (CTTCTAGACTTCCGATTTTCTGTCCTTCGAGC) and wapB_R/HindIII (CAGAAGCTTTCATCGACCCTCGACGCCGGTACC), and PAO1 genomic DNA was used as a template. The PCR product and pUCP26 vector were digested with XbaI and HindIII and ligated overnight at 16°C. The ligation was transformed into E. coli cells, and the transformants were selected on tetracycline plates.LPSs from the wild-type and mutant bacteria were prepared by the SDS and proteinase K method described by Hitchcock and Brown (15). The LPS samples were resolved by electrophoresis in Tricine-SDS-PAGE gels as described by Maskell (22). The LPS banding patterns were visualized by the ultrafast silver staining method (13). In the Western immunoblotting procedure, LPS was transferred onto BioTrace NT nitrocellulose membranes (Pall), and the blots were probed with MAb 5c-101 (outer core specific), 5c-7-4 (inner core specific), N1F10 (A band O antigen specific), MF15-4 (B band O antigen specific), and 5c-18-19 (specific for the core OS substituted with one unit of the O antigen [core-plus-one]) (8). The secondary antibody used was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G at a dilution of 1:2,000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The blots were developed using standard protocols by incubation with nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (NBT/BCIP) (1).Large-scale LPS preparations were obtained by the hot aqueous phenol method as described previously (35).LPS samples (80 mg each) in polypropylene vials were dissolved in 4 M KOH (4 ml each), kept overnight at 120°C, and neutralized with 2 M HCl. Precipitated material was removed by centrifugation, and deacylated material was isolated by gel chromatography on a Biogel P10 column (2.5 by 60 cm).LPS (50 mg) was dissolved in anhydrous hydrazine (1 ml) and kept at 50°C for 1 h, poured into 50 ml of water, dialyzed, and freeze-dried.Isolation of the O,N-deacylated core-lipid A backbone of the LPS was performed on a Sephadex G50 column. This column does not allow fine separation between the glycoforms of the core OS, and all glycoforms were collected together (one broad peak). However, NMR spectroscopy is sufficiently sensitive for studying a mixture of the various forms of OS molecules, provided there is not too much signal overlap. This approach has been used in recent studies to distinguish between two different core OS structures (26). NMR experiments were carried out on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz (1H) spectrometer with a 5-mm gradient probe at 25°C with an acetone internal reference (2.225 ppm for 1H and 31.45 ppm for 13C) using standard pulse sequences: double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQCOSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY; mixing time, 120 ms), rotation-frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY; mixing time, 500 ms), 1H-13C heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC; 100-ms long-range transfer delay). Acquisition time (AQ) was kept at 0.8 to 1 s for H-H correlations and at 0.25 s for HSQC; 256 increments were acquired for t1.Capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis was performed using a 4000 Q-Trap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/Sciex, Concord, Ontario, Canada) via a CE-MS interface with a 90-cm length of bare fused-silica capillary using 15 mM ammonium acetate in deionized water, pH 7.0. A sheath solution (isopropanol-methanol at 2:1) was delivered at a flow rate of 1.5 μl/min. The orifice voltage was set at −110 V.A BLAST search in the P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome revealed that an uncharacterized gene, pa1014, which we propose to be renamed wapB, encodes a protein that shares a relatively high sequence identity to MigA (58%) and WapR (33%), two putative rhamnosyltransferases required for outer core biosynthesis (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). This led us to hypothesize that wapB is involved in outer core OS biosynthesis. To characterize the function of wapB, a chromosomal knockout based on gene replacement of wapB with wapB::Gm was constructed in the P. aeruginosa PAO1 background. LPS from this mutant was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and silver staining of the gel showed a banding pattern that is very similar to that of the wild-type LPS, i.e., revealing a capped core with visible high-molecular-weight O-antigen bands and lower-molecular-weight core-plus-one O-antigen repeat bands (Fig. 2A). As confirmed by Western immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies (MAb) MF15-4 (B band O-polysaccharide specific), N1F10 (A band O-polysaccharide specific), and 5c-18-19 (core-plus-one O-repeat specific) (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material), the biosynthesis of these higher-molecular-weight LPS molecules was not affected by the wapB mutation. In contrast, the core LPS of the wapB::Gm mutant exhibited faster relative mobility in SDS-PAGE than the wild type, suggesting a truncation within the core OS (Fig. 2A and B). Moreover, when LPS molecules were analyzed by immunoblotting using the outer core-specific MAb 5c-101, the core OS of the wild type was recognized by the antibody, whereas LPS of the mutant was not (Fig. 2C). The phenotype was fully restored by complementation with wapB in trans. The low-molecular-weight core LPS band from the complemented strain showed reactivity with MAb 5c-101 and relative mobility indistinguishable from that of the wild-type core-lipid A LPS band. LPS of the migA mutant, which has a deficiency in outer core biosynthesis, was used as a control to allow for the comparison of the mobilities of core LPS bands between the migA and wapB mutants. The results showed that the mobilities of the low-molecular-weight core LPS bands between these mutant strains were similar in the SDS-PAGE gels. The 16% discontinuous Tricine-SDS-PAGE gel system did not provide sufficient resolution to show the difference between the core OS of the migA mutant and that of the wapB mutant. However, the low-molecular-weight bands from both mutants migrated faster than those of the wild-type bacteria. These results support our hypothesis that WapB is required for outer core LPS biosynthesis.SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analysis of LPS from the PAO1, wapB::Gm, and complemented strains. (A) Silver-stained SDS-PAGE. (B and C) Immunoblotting analysis using inner core-specific 7-4 antibody (B) and uncapped core-specific MAb 5c-101 (C). Core of the wapB::Gm mutant showed truncation and was not detected by the 5c-101 antibody, whereas the cores of PAO1 and the complemented strain showed identical banding patterns, and both cores were recognized by 5c-101. LPS from the migA::Gm mutant was used as a control.To further determine the function of WapB, we elucidated the structure of LPS prepared from the wapB mutant and the complemented strains by using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Completely deacylated LPSs from mutant and complemented strains were prepared from the LPSs of these bacteria by KOH treatment. The products had well-resolved NMR spectra and were analyzed without further purification. A set of two-dimensional spectra (DQCOSY, TOCSY, NOESY, 1H-13C gHSQC, 1H-13C gradient HMBC [gHMBC], 1H-31P HMQC, and 1H-31P HMQC-TOCSY) was recorded for each compound and interpreted using the Topspin (Bruker) program. Spectra of the deacylated products from both strains were similar except for the absence of β-Glc (residue N) in the wapB mutant. Due to removal of this residue, the H-1 signal of the Rha (K residue) significantly shifted upfield from 5.12 ppm in the complemented strain to 4.82 ppm in the wapB mutant (Table 2 and Fig. 3). Positions of 13C signals of Rha (K residue) in the wapB mutant strain corresponded to nonsubstituted α-rhamnopyranose. Assignment of the configuration and connectivity (i.e., J/H coupling constants) for each spin system led to the structures presented in Fig. 4. NMR signals for the uncapped core of the OS1 (2519.56 atomic mass units [amu]) and OS3 (2357.5 amu) corresponded well with data published previously, with OS1 being the uncapped core of the complemented strain and OS3 being the uncapped core of the mutant (3, 20). The capped OS2 (2502.6 amu) was identical in the mutant and the complemented strains, and this mass was consistent with that of core OS with a substitution of one unit of the O antigen (also called core-plus-one O antigen LPS glycoform). The initiating sugar of the B band of the O5 serotype linked to l-Rha (Fig. 4, M residue) was β-FucN, because the acetyl group of β-FucNAc was removed by KOH treatment. Fucosamine was detected in a β-configuration as it is always observed with the monosaccharide linking O antigen to the core. When LPS was O deacylated with hydrazine, complete repeating units with two 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxymannuronic acids were present in capped glycoforms of both strains, as confirmed by MS. Data from MS analysis of the oligosaccharides are in agreement with the presented structures. The observed masses of the core-plus-one capped glycoform at 3,488.0 amu (Fig. 5A) in the mutant strain and at 3,487.6 amu (Fig. 5B) in the comple-mented are in accordance with the calculated mass for Rha1Hex3Hep2HexN3HexNNA2C12OH2P5Ala1Ac4, which is 3,486.1 amu (the amidine group was removed by the hydrazine treatment). The masses of O-deacylated uncapped glycoforms of both strains were in agreement with the structures determined by NMR. The molecular mass of uncapped glycoform of the mutant strain was 2,826.0 amu (Fig. 5A), which corresponds to chemical composition of Rha1Hex3Hep2HexN3HexNNA2C12OH2P5Ala1, whereas the uncapped core of complemented strain had a molecular mass of 2,986.9 Da (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the shift in molecular masses of the two strains corresponds to addition of one Glc residue in the complemented strain.NMR data for the outer core of OS1, OS2, and OS3NMR spectra of the wapB::Gm mutant and the complemented strain. The figure shows the overlap of fragments of TOCSY spectra of fully deacylated LPS from the mutant (black) and complemented strain (gray), showing correlations from anomeric protons. Signals of individual spin systems are connected by horizontal lines and labeled at one end by sugar residue labels shown on the structural formula. Note the absence of β-glucose (N residue) in the mutant and a large shift in position of anomeric signal of the Rha (K residue), caused by this difference between the structures of the mutant and complemented strains (arrow). Letters correspond to sugar residues depicted in Fig. 4.LPS structures derived from NMR spectroscopy of the fully deacylated LPS from the wapB::Gm mutant (A) and wapB::Gm/wapB complemented (B) strains. OS1, uncapped core oligosaccharide of the mutant; OS2*, capped (core-plus-one glycoform) oligosaccharides that are present in the mutant and the complemented strain (note that as anticipated, the two elucidated OS2 structures are identical); OS3, uncapped core oligosaccharide of the complemented strain.Mass spectrometry analysis of O-deacylated LPS from the wapB::Gm mutant (A) and wapB::Gm/wapB complemented (B) strains. Electrospray ionization mass spectra are in deconvoluted negative mode. The main peaks corresponding to the capped core OS with one O-antigen repeat (core-plus-one glycoform) and uncapped glycoforms are depicted with stars and rectangles, respectively. The shift in masses of uncapped core OS between the mutant and complemented strains corresponds to one glucose residue that was absent in the mutant. Arrows indicate the following core OS modifications: P, phosphate group; EtN, ethanolamine; PEtN, phosphoethanolamine.To summarize the above observations, based on NMR and MS analyses, both strains produced two distinct glycoforms corresponding to the capped and uncapped core OSs (Fig. 4). The outer core OS structures of the capped glycoforms, designated OS2, of the wapB::Gm mutant and the complemented strain were identical to the OS structure of PAO1 as shown previously (26). The uncapped cores of the two strains differed in the absence of terminal β-linked d-Glc (Fig. 4, N residue) in the mutant, whereas the structure of the uncapped core OS of the complemented strain was identical to the PAO1 core structures published previously (26). These structural data on LPSs from the mutant and the complemented strain strongly indicate that WapB is a 1,2-glucosyltransferase.Since not all the P. aeruginosa strains contain GlcIV in the core OS, we decided to test if wapB in a plasmid construct could be functional and able to confer the transfer of a GlcIV in the strains that lacked this terminal sugar residue in their LPSs. We chose the GlcIV-negative IATS reference strains, O1, O3, O4, O6, O9, O11, O12, O13, O14, O15, and O17, and transformed them with the plasmid pUCP26wapB. LPS prepared from each of the transformants reacted positively with MAb 5c-101 in Western immunoblotting (Fig. 6B), whereas the LPS from the wild-type strain of each of these serotypes was not recognized by the MAb (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the strength of the reactivity of MAb 5c-101 to the LPS core band of all the serotypes expressing WapB was comparable to that observed between the antibody and the complemented wapB::Gm/wapB strain. There was one exception: a weak interaction was observed between MAb 5c-101 and the LPS prepared from serotype O6 expressing wapB in trans. At present, we do not have an explanation for this anomaly. Nevertheless, these data showed that WapB was able to modify the LPS core of all the serotypes lacking the terminal d-GlcIV residue. Interestingly, a search for wapB genes in sequenced P. aeruginosa genomes of the serotypable strains PA14 and PA7 revealed that the genome of PA14, a GlcIV-positive strain, contains the wapB gene in the same location as observed in PAO1, whereas wapB is absent from the genome of PA7, a GlcIV-negative strain. This presence and absence of wapB in PA14 and PA7 genomes, respectively, is in good agreement with the serotype identities of PA14 (O10; GlcIV positive) and PA7 (O12; GlcIV negative).Immunoblotting analysis of LPS from GlcIV-negative strains expressing WapB and corresponding wild-type Glc IV-negative strains. The reference strains of P. aeruginosa serotypes IATS O1, O3, O4, O6, O9, O11, O12, O13, O14, O15, and O17 were transformed with pUCP26wapB, and immunoblots were probed with uncapped core-specific MAb 5c-101. LPSs of wild-type reference strains were not recognized by 5c-101 (A), whereas LPS from transformants were recognized (B). PAO1 and the complemented strain wapB::Gm/wapB were used as controls.In this report, we showed that the uncharacterized gene pa1014 (annotated as wapB) of P. aeruginosa PAO1 is required for transferring the β-1,2-linked d-GlcIV to the outer core OS. This residue was not present in the LPS core structure of the wapB::Gm mutant as determined by NMR. Since the only difference in the core LPSs between the mutant and complemented strains was the absence of GlcIV in the mutant core OS, the evidence suggested that WapB is a putative β-1,2-linkage-specific glucosyltransferase. LPS from the wapB::Gm mutant was not recognized by MAb 5c-101, whereas adding wapB in trans in the mutant restored reactivity to the antibody. Thus, our results have verified that the MAb 5c-101 epitope includes GlcIV of the outer uncapped core, as hypothesized earlier by our group (9). There are still two other Glc residues (GlcI and GlcIII) in the outer core OS that are transferred by unidentified enzymes; therefore, other unknown glucosyltransferases are involved in outer core biosynthesis. This is consistent with what has been reported for the biosynthesis of the E. coli and Salmonella outer core OSs, where each Glc residue with unique linkage is transferred by a different enzyme (reviewed in reference 36).The P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome contains a gene cluster (PA4996-PA5012) encoding proteins involved in core OS biosynthesis. At present, many of the genes in this cluster have not been fully characterized to determine their roles in core OS biosynthesis (18). A putative glycosyltransferase, PA5001, is localized in this cluster, and it might be required for the addition of GlcIII (as proposed by King and coauthors [18]). Our group has recently reported that the encoded product of the ssg gene, a homologue of PA5001, in Pseudomonas alkylphenolia is a putative glycosyltransferase that is important for both LPS and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis (31). In terms of having the last outer core glucosyltransferase gene located outside the core OS biosynthesis locus, there is precedent to this observation since a gene encoding the putative 1,6-rhamnosyltransferase, MigA, is also localized outside the core cluster. In other Pseudomonas species whose genomes have been sequenced, wapB homologues could not be detected. However, other genes sharing a higher level of homology to migA than to wapB were observed. This observation correlates well with the elucidated core OS structures of Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Pseudomonas fluorescens, which do not contain β-1,2-linked Glc residues (19, 21, 40). Hence, WapB is apparently unique in P. aeruginosa; however, it is intriguing that not all the strains in this species produce the terminal GlcIV residue in the outer core. Transforming serotype type strains lacking GlcIV in the outer core with plasmid DNA carrying wapB has led to a change in their core OS structures, as assayed by the reactivity to MAb 5c-101 in Western immunoblotting. The weakest reactivity between the core LPS and this MAb was observed in serotype O6 expressing wapB in trans. The outer core structure of the O6 strain has been elucidated, and apart from the absence of GlcIV, it possesses no other apparent structural differences from the outer core OS of PAO1 (4). Hence, we speculate that WapB was not able to effectively transfer Glc to the O6 core acceptor because of the presence of nonsugar modifications, for instance, O-acetylation that may be lost during the sample preparation procedures prior to structural analyses (19). As reported earlier, in some P. aeruginosa strains, core OSs are nonstoichiometrically O acetylated, and most O-acetyl groups were located on the terminal l-RhaA of the uncapped glycoform (2), which may suggest that the core of the O6 strain is highly O acetylated on the l-RhaA, which would prevent the core from being glucosylated by WapB.Interestingly, the core OSs have been shown to play an active role in pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, especially in the interaction of the bacterium with epithelial and corneal cells (12, 25, 38, 39). The specific core residues of uncapped or capped core OSs that serve as ligands for interaction with cell receptors have not been identified. Nevertheless, the tissue culture or animal experiments suggested that even though the core OS is a short polymer, it is likely not completely covered by a long-chain O antigen at the cell surface, thus allowing core OS to interact with environment. This observation may be a reason why P. aeruginosa simultaneously produces two glycoforms, one of which is not substituted by O polysaccharides, which allows more core OS to be available for interactions with not only cells but also the environment.WapB is the closest homologue of MigA, the uncapped outer core rhamnosyltransferase. Strikingly, MigA shares more identity with WapB, a putative glucosyltransferase, than with the other outer core rhamnosyltransferase (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). All three homologues belong to the same inverting glycosyltransferase (GT-2) family (CAZy database [5]) and may have similar enzymatic mechanisms. In future experiments, it will be necessary to develop an enzymatic assay in order to determine the enzymatic mechanism of WapB as a 1,2-glucosyltransferase.In conclusion, we have provided genetic and chemical structure evidence to demonstrate that wapB is required for the addition of GlcIV to the proximal location in the uncapped outer core OS of P. aeruginosa PAO1. We characterized the core OS structure of the wapB knockout mutant by Western immunoblotting and NMR and MS analyses. The mutant core OS lacked the terminal β-1,2-linked d-GlcIV, indicating that WapB is a 1,2-glucosyltransferase. Although not all the serotypes of P. aeruginosa produce an uncapped core OS with the terminal GlcIV, expressing wapB in trans in these serotypes can confer reactivity to MAb 5c-101, which strongly suggests addition of GlcIV onto their outer core structures.This work was supported by an operating grant from Cystic Fibrosis Canada (CFC).

",False,"In microbial communities, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), also called the extracellular matrix, provide the spatial organization and structural stability during biofilm development. One of the major components of EPS is protein, but it is not clear what specific functions these proteins contribute to the extracellular matrix or to microbial physiology. To investigate this in biofilms from an extremely acidic environment, we used shotgun proteomics analyses to identify proteins associated with EPS in biofilms at two developmental stages, designated DS1 and DS2. The proteome composition of the EPS was significantly different from that of the cell fraction, with more than 80% of the cellular proteins underrepresented or undetectable in EPS. In contrast, predicted periplasmic, outer membrane, and extracellular proteins were overrepresented by 3- to 7-fold in EPS. Also, EPS proteins were more basic by ∼2 pH units on average and about half the length. When categorized by predicted function, proteins involved in motility, defense, cell envelope, and unknown functions were enriched in EPS. Chaperones, such as histone-like DNA binding protein and cold shock protein, were overrepresented in EPS. Enzymes, such as protein peptidases, disulfide-isomerases, and those associated with cell wall and polysaccharide metabolism, were also detected. Two of these enzymes, identified as β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and cellulase, were confirmed in the EPS fraction by enzymatic activity assays. Compared to the differences between EPS and cellular fractions, the relative differences in the EPS proteomes between DS1 and DS2 were smaller and consistent with expected physiological changes during biofilm development.The acid mine drainage (AMD) environment presents an extreme challenge for most forms of life on Earth. However, several microorganisms thrive in this environment and play an important role in AMD generation (15). These microorganisms live as microbial communities that form pellicle biofilms on the surfaces of AMD pools and streams (11). Biofilms are composed mostly of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), also known as the extracellular matrix, a major structural component that provides spatial organization and stability to the microbial community.We previously characterized the EPS compositions of two AMD biofilms, designated developmental stage 1 and 2 biofilms (DS1 and DS2) (28), collected from the Richmond Mine at Iron Mountain in Redding, CA (34, 44). Protein is the third most abundant component in the EPS, behind carbohydrates and heavy metals (28). Previous molecular characterization of these AMD microbial community populations (10) indicated that the DS1 biofilm was dominated by Leptospirillum group II, which accounted for 90% of the population, and that there were minor amounts of Leptospirillum group III (3%) and archaea (7%). In comparison, the thicker DS2 biofilm was comprised of a more diverse community, including Leptospirillum group II (43%), Leptospirillum group III (28%), and archaea (29%). However, it remains a considerable challenge to provide a complete biochemical profile of the EPS, and little is known about the function of the proteins present, which is essential for understanding the biofilm physiology and how changes in protein composition affect community organization and development.EPS-associated proteins have been identified from many microorganisms, indicating that various proteins with essential functions are present (17, 40, 41, 51). For example, over 200 proteins have been found in the EPS of Haemophilus influenzae (21), with the most frequently identified proteins being those involved in cell motility and secretion, ribosomal proteins, and proteins of unknown function. Over 500 proteins were identified in the EPS of an Escherichia coli culture, whose functions are related mostly to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways and cell wall and membrane biogenesis (17). Several extracellular or outer membrane proteins involved in the defense response or cell adhesion have been found in the EPS of several microorganisms (9, 37, 41, 51). Examples include flagella, porins, lipoproteins, root adhesins, immunodominant antigens, and superoxide dismutase. Furthermore, several extracellular carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were found for Aspergillus oryzae (40); proteins with lipoprotein secretion signals, such as metalloproteases, were found in the EPS fibrils of Myxococcus xanthus (9).In addition to these EPS proteome studies, numerous studies have reported differential expression of cellular proteins in biofilm compared to the planktonic growth state, providing a base profile of protein expression specifically important for biofilm growth. Various proteins relating to flagella, ABC transporters, chaperones, cell adhesion, and the oxidative stress response were upregulated during the biofilm growth stage (14, 30).The objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the functions of proteins residing in the extracellular matrices of biofilms growing in an AMD environment. Given the extreme acidity and high level of heavy metals that these proteins encounter, we anticipated that the EPS proteome would be dramatically different from those of nonextremophiles. Using an environmental proteomics approach, we identified and compared proteins present in the extracellular matrices of two biofilms at different developmental stages, providing insights into EPS proteome dynamics and potential biological functions.Biofilms were collected in May and August 2007 from the surfaces of AMD pools at the “AB Muck” location within the Richmond Mine, at Iron Mountain in Redding, CA (15). Visual examination and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated that the sample harvested in August represented a mid-developmental-stage thin biofilm (developmental stage 1 biofilm [DS1]); the sample harvested in May represented a later-growth-stage, thicker biofilm (developmental stage 2 biofilm [DS2]) (10, 28). The EPS was extracted according to procedures described previously (28). Briefly, biofilm samples were frozen on dry ice upon sampling, and the frozen samples were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 5,000 × g at 4°C for 60 min to remove residual AMD solution trapped in the biofilm. The supernatant, designated the “AMD solution” was saved. The pelleted biofilm was resuspended in 30 ml of cold sulfuric acid solution (0.2 M sulfuric acid, pH 1.1), which resembles the acid mine drainage solution in the sampling site where these biofilms grow. The biofilm matrix containing EPS was then disrupted using a glass hand-held homogenizer (Wheaton Science Products, Millville, NJ). The cell suspension was stirred on ice for 2 h before centrifugation again at 10,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min to remove residual cells and debris. The resulting pellet, designated the “cellular fraction,” was saved, and the supernatant containing EPS was precipitated with 15 volumes of 100% cold ethanol and stored at −20°C overnight. The low quantity of lipid present in the DS1 supernatant suggested that substantial cell lysis did not occur during sample preparation (28). EPS was then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min and resuspended in 20 ml water using the homogenizer. The cellular fraction was washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.76 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4) and resuspended in diluted (1:10) BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) in PBS. The suspension was kept on ice and sonicated (Misonix, Farmingdale, NY; 50% intensity, 6 cycles of 30 s on and 30 s off). Proteins from the extracted EPS, the AMD solution, and the cellular fraction were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (28), and the TCA precipitates were washed three times in cold methanol, air dried at room temperature, and frozen at −80°C until liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses.TCA precipitates from extracted EPS were used for enzymatic activity assays. Briefly, the washed TCA precipitate of proteins extracted from DS2 EPS was resuspended in 50 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0. A protein concentration of 1 mg/ml was used for all the assays. β-N-Acetylglucosaminidase was measured by hydrolysis of the artificial substrate 4-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (NP-GlcNAc) (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO). Cellulase activity was measured using three different substrates, i.e., cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, and the fluorescent substrate resorufin cellobioside (MarkerGene, Eugene, OR), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose were used at 0.2% and mixed with EPS protein at a 1:1 (vol/vol) ratio. Samples were then incubated in the dark overnight (∼12 h) at 37°C or on ice for the controls. After incubation, glucose was measured using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid as described by Miller et al. (36). β-N-Acetylglucosaminidase activity was determined by absorption measurements at 405 nm. Cellulase activity with resorufin cellobioside was determined by fluorescence measurement (560-nm excitation and 590-nm emission wavelengths). Optical density and fluorescence measurements were read with a spectrophotometric plate reader (Synergy HT; BioTek, Winooski, VT).Each protein fraction was denatured and reduced in a solution of 6 M guanidine and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.6) for 1 h with shaking at 60°C. The solution was then diluted 6-fold with 50 mM Tris buffer containing 10 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.6), and proteins were digested using 1:100 (wt/wt) sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Insoluble cellular material was removed by centrifugation (2,000 × g for 10 min). Peptides were desalted offline by C18 solid-phase extraction (Waters, Milford, MA), concentrated, filtered, and aliquoted as described previously (56). Three technical replicates of each fraction were analyzed by two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D-LC-MS/MS) on an LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) as described elsewhere (10, 23, 59). In brief, chromatographic separation of the tryptic peptides was conducted over a 24-h period of increasing (0 to 500 mM) pulses of ammonium acetate followed by a 2-h gradient from aqueous to organic solvent. The LTQ was operated in a data-dependent manner as follows: full scans at 30K resolution were acquired in the Orbitrap, followed by five data-dependent MS/MS spectra acquired in the LTQ; two microscans were averaged for both full and MS/MS scans, and dynamic exclusion was set at one.The resulting MS/MS spectra were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm (60) against a composite community database, Biofilm_AMD_CoreDB_04232008.fasta, available at http://compbio.ornl.gov/amd_gtl_ms_results/databases/ (12). This database contains proteins derived from the 5-way (53) and UBA (34) community genomic data sets. The proteomics search database contained the curated predicted proteins of Leptospirillum group II 5-way CG type (2,596 proteins) (48), Leptospirillum group II UBA type (2,629 proteins) (23, 34), Leptospirillum group III (2,695 proteins) (23), unassigned Leptospirillum (49 proteins), G-plasma (1,445 proteins), Ferroplasma acidarmanus types I and II (1,628 and 2,409 proteins, respectively, plus 512 proteins from a laboratory isolate) (1), unassigned bacterial and archaeal proteins (1,227 proteins) (53), and common contaminants such as keratin and trypsin (36 proteins). The output data files were then filtered and sorted with the DTASelect algorithm (44) using parameters reported previously to give a false-discovery rate of <5% (34, 44, 52). The high-accuracy mass measurements of the LTQ-Orbitrap allowed better than ±10 ppm for ∼80 to 85% of identified peptides.All MS data, including spectral counts, sequence counts, sequence coverage, and normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) (34, 44, 52) values, as well as links to all identified spectra can be found at: http://compbio.ornl.gov/amd_eps/.Because the AMD reference database contains some protein variants with very similar peptide sequences, we removed those protein variants with nearly identical patterns of spectral counts across all replicates. Spectral counts were then normalized to sum to 100,000 in each replicate to enable comparisons across samples. To test which proteins had significantly different abundances in DS1 and DS2, we used a normal approximation to the difference of binomial proportions, and performed a two-tailed test with a Bonferroni correction to account for the large number of proteins tested (46).We used a combination of various publically available algorithms to assign a predicted subcellular localization for each of the 3,426 nonredundant proteins found in EPS, AMD solution, and the cellular fraction. We used TMHMM v2.0 (33) and SCAMPI (4) to predict transmembrane domains and SignalP 3.0 (19) to find signal peptides indicative of proteins secreted out of the cytosol (see also reference 20). As SignalP does not provide a predictor for archaeal signal peptides, we ran the archaeal proteins through the Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and eukaryotic predictors and kept only those predictions on which all three agreed, as recommended by Nielsen et al. (38). We used BOMP (5) to predict outer membrane proteins, as well as PsortB v.3.0 (22), which provides one of the widest ranges of subcellular locations, including cytoplasmic, cytoplasmic membrane, periplasmic, outer membrane, and extracellular. Lastly, we used Subloc v1.0 (26) for those proteins not predicted to be membrane associated by any of the previous methods. Since Subloc tended to overpredict periplasmic and extracellular localizations for a number of abundant ribosomal proteins (24) with noted inconsistencies in subcellular localization predictions by different prediction tools, all annotated ribosomal proteins were assigned to the cytoplasm. Due to the application of these multiple predictors, a small number of proteins (117 out of 3,426) were assigned to two locations, in which case they were counted in both for the purposes of the statistics and figures presented here.We used the November 2008 release of PRIAM (7), modified for nucleotide queries using the “-p F” flag of RPSBLAST, to assign the four-digit Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers, at an E value of <1e−10. We also used BLASTX to search for homologs (at an E value of <1e−20) against 87,000 enzyme sequences in a local copy of the CAZy and FOLy databases (6). We used the best BLASTX hit for each sequence read to assign protein family memberships and the best BLASTX hit against the 6,367 CAZy and FOLy enzymes that have independently validated EC numbers to assign a putative EC number. If the existing functional annotation, PRIAM search, and CAZy search resulted in more than one EC number, we used the existing annotation where available; otherwise we let the best CAZy hit take priority over PRIAM. The Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) assignment for each protein sequence was determined by performing RPSBLAST against the NCBI COG database using an E value threshold of 0.00001. The top hit was used for the assignment.Proteins associated with EPS were identified in biofilms DS1 and DS2 and compared to those in the cellular fraction and in some cases to those in the AMD solution (the liquid that was trapped in the biofilm matrix when samples were collected). Based on proteome sequence coverage, we found that proteins from Leptospirillum group II are dominant (∼90%) in both the cellular and EPS fractions of DS1 and DS2. Nevertheless, EPS proteins are substantially different from those in the cellular fraction, with ∼80% of the proteins detected in the cellular fraction underrepresented or undetectable in the EPS. In contrast, proteins with special characteristics in regard to isoelectric point, size, subcellular localization, and function are overrepresented in the EPS compared to the cellular fraction, and these are the focus of our analyses. In total, 1,351 nonredundant proteins were identified in the EPS proteome (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), of which the top 20 account for about half of the EPS proteome based on MS/MS spectral counts (Table 1). In the following sections, first we focus on the difference between the EPS and cellular fractions, averaged between DS1 and DS2, and then in the final section we revisit the relatively smaller differences in EPS proteomes between DS1 and DS2.Top 20 proteins identified in the EPS of DS1 and DS2 biofilms based on spectral countsProteins with higher isoelectric points (pI) are more abundant in EPS than in the cellular fraction. Leptospirillum group II, the dominant species in DS1 and DS2 biofilms living at a pH of ∼1 (2), has an entire proteomic profile that is shifted approximately one pH unit higher than those of common neutrophilic microbes (57). We consistently observed an average predicted pI of 8.5 for EPS proteins, compared to 6.8 for the cellular fraction. Examples of proteins with unusually high pI values that are abundant in EPS include putative flagellins (pI 9.76), histone-like DNA binding proteins (pI 10.66), peptidoglycan binding domain-containing proteins (pI 10.92), and a protein of unknown function (pI 11.66) (Table 2).Top 15 highly abundant proteins with isoelectric points of greater than 9.0 present in EPS and AMD solutionThe pI distribution of EPS proteins displays a distinctive bimodal shape (Fig. 1), with 31% of the proteome at pI 5 to 7 and 56% at pI 9 to 11. In contrast, the majority of the proteins in the cellular fraction have pIs of between 5 and 7. The EPS proteins also showed a small but significant increase around pI 10.7, while few cellular proteins have pI values above 9.7.Distribution of isoelectric point (pI) by protein abundance for proteins from the EPS and cellular fractions of DS1 and DS2 biofilms.In keeping with their high pI values, many EPS proteins are predicted to be located on or outside the cell envelope, exposed to the highly acidic AMD environment. While predicted cytoplasmic proteins are dominant in the cellular fraction (78%), more than half of the total spectral counts of EPS proteins consist of predicted periplasmic proteins and proteins of unknown localization (Fig. 2). Also, a greater increase of the predicted extracellular proteins in EPS (7%) and AMD solution (3%) than in the cellular fraction (1%) was observed. There was a 3-fold increase in proteins with one or more transmembrane domains in EPS compared to the cellular fraction and a 4- to 5-fold increase in proteins with a signal sequence (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Additionally, proteins in the EPS are relatively smaller, with a weighted average of ∼25 kDa, compared to ∼45 kDa for proteins from the cellular fraction.Comparison of relative abundances of proteins in EPS and cellular fractions that are predicted to reside in various subcellular locations, Cyt, cytoplasmic; IM, inner membrane; Per, periplasmic; OM, outer membrane; Ext, extracellular; Unknown, unknown location.Proteins identified in EPS were categorized according to their biological function using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins (COG) database (50). Of the 25 COG categories, 22 have representations in the biofilm proteome, with category J (translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis) the most abundant across all fractions (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Functions related to amino acids (E), energy production and conversion (C), transcription (K), and chaperones (O) decreased by 2-fold or greater in EPS compared to the cellular fraction. In contrast, a 2-fold or greater increase was observed in EPS proteins related to motility (N), cell envelope (M), replication, recombination and repair (L), and inorganic ion transport and metabolism (P), most of which resemble those previously identified in the EPS of other microbial systems (9, 37, 41, 51).In addition, proteins of unknown function and proteins with no designated COG family are also overrepresented in EPS, indicating that these novel proteins may function in adaptation to the extreme environment.Because polysaccharides are a major component in the EPS of these biofilms (28), carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) are likely to play an important role in synthesis, modification, and degradation of EPS. Putative CAZymes were identified in the EPS proteome by comparison of protein sequences against a library of sequences from all the entries present in the CAZy database (6). Given that enzymes (whose EC numbers are given in Table S1 in the supplemental material) in general are present in low abundance in EPS, most of the CAZy homologs identified are also found in low abundance and are not enriched in EPS by substantial amounts (Table 3). In this regard, we discuss CAZymes for identification purposes only, and information on relative abundance is not emphasized.List of carbohydrate-active enzymes in the EPS proteomes of DS1 and DS2 biofilmsMany of the CAZymes present are likely to be involved in EPS degradation (Table 3). Two such examples are β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and cellulase. β-N-Acetylhexosaminidase is an outer-membrane-associated lipoprotein that often degrades complex oligosaccharides (31). Cellulase may act in recycling of extracellular polysaccharides for nutrients or in biofilm dissolution. Indeed, several lines of evidence have suggested the presence of cellulosic polysaccharide in the EPS of DS1 and DS2 biofilms (28). Additionally, cellulase appears to be more abundant in the EPS of DS2 than in that of DS1, suggesting a higher demand of this protein at later biofilm developmental stages.We further experimentally tested and confirmed that proteins extracted from DS2 EPS exhibit both β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and cellulase activities, suggesting that these enzymes are active in EPS (Table 4). It is worth noting that cellulase activity was detected only with carboxymethylcellulose as a substrate and not with cellulose or the fluorescent substrate resorufin cellobioside (data not shown), which is indicative of a low level of endocellulase activity that works poorly on crystalline cellulose or cellobioside substrates. This is also consistent with the finding of amorphous-phase extracellular polysaccharides present in biofilm matrix (28). The optimal pH is about 5 for both β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and cellulase activities (Table 4), although a lower optimal pH of enzyme activity is expected for EPS proteomes extracted from microbial communities that live at a pH of ∼1. Nevertheless, the optimal pH of these enzymes is consistent with that of two previously described c-type cytochromes isolated from the extracellular fraction of this AMD community (27, 49).Enzymatic activities of proteins extracted from DS2 EPS at different pHsIn addition to the CAZymes related enzymes listed in Table 3, a protein annotated as “putative glycosyl hydrolase, BNR repeat” is also present in high abundance (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). BNR repeats are known to occur frequently in secreted proteins and in proteins that act on or interact with polysaccharides (8, 45). Given its lack of homology with any of the known enzymes in the CAZy database, we suspect that this protein may represent a novel glycosyl hydrolase.Compared to the differences between EPS and the cellular fractions, the relative differences in the EPS fraction between DS1 and DS2 biofilms are smaller (Table 5; see Table S2 in the supplemental material). Proteins related to cell motility (N), intracellular trafficking and secretion (U), and secondary metabolites (Q) are 2-fold or more lower in DS2 EPS than in DS1. In contrast, proteins involved in transcription (K), replication, recombination, and repair (L), defense mechanisms (V), lipid transport and metabolism (I), and cell wall biogenesis (M) are a 2-fold or more higher in DS2 EPS than in DS1.Top 20 proteins that are differentially represented in the EPS proteomes of DS1 and DS2Proteins overrepresented in DS1 include putative ribosomal proteins, flagellar proteins, isocitrate dehydrogenase, rubrerythrin, and a putative phage shock protein. Proteins overrepresented in DS2 include c-type cytochromes, cold shock proteins, a putative histone-like DNA binding protein, and proteins of unknown function (Table 5; see Table S2 in the supplemental material). The most conspicuous change observed in DS2 is the decrease in abundance of flagellum-related proteins, a classical group of cell surface proteins involved in attachment during biofilm formation in many microorganisms (30). In the AMD pellicle biofilms, flagella are likely to be important for the initial cell-to-cell attachment, but the decreased expression in DS2 suggests that flagella are of less importance in fully developed biofilms. It is also noteworthy that the abundance of flagellum-related proteins in these AMD biofilms increased again in very late developmental stages (36a), suggesting a role for flagella during biofilm dissemination.Besides the expected periplasmic and membrane proteins present in EPS, a large number of cytoplasmic proteins were also detected, such as ribosomal proteins. Proteins that are abundant in EPS may result from high expression, high levels of protein secretion, cell lysis, or shedding of protein-containing membrane vesicles during cell growth (3). Based on the relative abundance of the nonclassical secretory proteins present in both EPS and cellular fractions, we estimate that up to 9 to 14% of the EPS proteome consists of cellular contamination. The low quantity of lipid present in the EPS of DS1 biofilm suggests that substantial cell lysis did not occur during our sample preparation (28); thus, non-extracellular protein contamination in EPS is likely due to the presence of cellular debris from cell lysis occurring naturally in the community.Nevertheless, a large number of proteins with special functions relevant to the AMD environment were identified (Table 1; see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The presence of a highly abundant cold shock protein is one of the least expected. Despite the fact that heat shock proteins are commonly upregulated under biofilm growth conditions (17, 51), to our knowledge there is only one report so far on the upregulation of a cold shock protein in non-AMD biofilms (14). We initially suspected that freezing of biofilms on dry ice after sample collection could have induced its expression. However, the same protein was found in abundance even when samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen right after sampling, where the amount of time during freezing is probably too short to induce the expression of a large quantity of protein (V. J. Denef, personal communication). Although this protein found in EPS has homology to the bacterial CspC cold shock proteins involved in transcription, we postulate that its actual function in the biofilm matrix is to protect and stabilize nucleic acids as chaperones (43), unrelated to a cold shock response.The abundance of EPS proteins involved in defense mechanisms may reflect a protection strategy of the AMD microbial community. Given the high concentration of heavy metals in the AMD environment (15), heavy-metal-induced hydrogen peroxide production is likely to occur (29, 39). Consistently, several proteins related to superoxide dismutase (SOD) are present in high abundance in EPS, including chaperones, EF-Tu, rubrerythrin, peroxiredoxin, cytochrome c peroxidase, and phage shock protein A, many of which have previously been identified in the EPS of other microorganisms (9, 37, 41, 51). Another example of a protective protein identified in EPS is UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Also known as UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, it appears to have a dual function in both trehalose metabolism (16) and thermotolerance and osmotolerance in stationary-phase E. coli and Bacillus subtilis (25, 55). Consistently, another trehalose-acting enzyme, trehalose-phosphatase, was also identified through CAZy analysis (Table 3), indicating that trehalose may be an important component in the EPS of the AMD community. Trehalose is a nonreducing disaccharide and is highly resistant to heat and extreme pH (47). In trehalose-producing organisms, such as Leptospirillum rubarum of the AMD community (23) and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans (42), this compound may serve as an energy reserve, a buffer against stresses, or a protein stabilizer (13, 18, 58).Histone-like DNA binding protein is one of the most abundant proteins in EPS (Table 1). A direct role for this class of DNA binding proteins in EPS has not been reported; normally these proteins bind tightly with chromosomal DNA in the nucleotide structure. The importance of extracellular DNA as a structural component of biofilm in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recently reported, and this has subsequently been demonstrated in a variety of bacterial species (35). Indeed, we have detected the presence of extracellular DNA in the EPS of DS1 (∼5% [dry weight]) and DS2 (∼2% [dry weight]) (28). DNA is extremely sensitive to reactive oxygen species, and specific and nonspecific DNA binding proteins have previously been detected in the EPS of E. coli biofilms (17). We speculate that the histone-like DNA binding protein binds to extracellular DNA in the EPS of the AMD biofilms and acts to support or organize biofilm structure, although we cannot rule out other possibilities. Histone-like DNA binding proteins may also play a regulatory role in the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides (32), or the high abundance of this protein may be related to an increase in protein export (54).In summary, AMD biofilms were found to produce a unique profile of EPS proteins, with enrichment of novel proteins that are likely required for adaptation to this extreme environment. Future biochemical characterization and functional analysis of the EPS proteome will increase our understanding of the ecophysiology of the AMD microbial community.Funding for this study was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, from the Genomics Sciences Program, grant DE-FG02-05ER64134.

PMC3147823,Virulence Gene Pool Detected in Bovine Group C Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae Isolates by Use of a Group A S. pyogenes Virulence Microarray ▿,False,"A custom-designed microarray containing 220 virulence genes of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]) was used to test group C Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (GCS) field strains causing bovine mastitis and group C or group G Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (GCS/GGS) isolates from human infections, with the latter being used for comparative purposes, for the presence of virulence genes. All bovine and all human isolates carried a fraction of the 220 genes (23% and 39%, respectively). The virulence genes encoding streptolysin S, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the plasminogen-binding M-like protein PAM, and the collagen-like protein SclB were detected in the majority of both bovine and human isolates (94 to 100%). Virulence factors, usually carried by human beta-hemolytic streptococcal pathogens, such as streptokinase, laminin-binding protein, and the C5a peptidase precursor, were detected in all human isolates but not in bovine isolates. Additionally, GAS bacteriophage-associated virulence genes encoding superantigens, DNase, and/or streptodornase were detected in bovine isolates (72%) but not in the human isolates. Determinants located in non-bacteriophage-related mobile elements, such as the gene encoding R28, were detected in all bovine and human isolates. Several virulence genes, including genes of bacteriophage origin, were shown to be expressed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Phylogenetic analysis of superantigen gene sequences revealed a high level (>98%) of identity among genes of bovine GCS, of the horse pathogen Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, and of the human pathogen GAS. Our findings indicate that alpha-hemolytic bovine GCS, an important mastitis pathogen and considered to be a nonhuman pathogen, carries important virulence factors responsible for virulence and pathogenesis in humans.Alpha-hemolytic Lancefield group C Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (GCS) is a pathogen frequently associated with clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, a disease that causes major economic losses in the dairy industry (51, 67). Virulence determinants have been identified for this pathogen, such as surface proteins which specifically interact with plasma or extracellular matrix proteins of the host, such as alpha-2-macroglobulin, plasminogen, albumin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, vitronectin, and collagen (30, 35, 46, 64), and genes coding for proteins assumed to play a role in mastitis, such as the alpha-2-macroglobulin-, immunoglobulin G-, or immunoglobulin A-binding protein Mig (25, 55); the alpha 2-macroglobulin- or immunoglobulin G-binding protein Mag (24); and a fibrinogen-binding M-like protein (65).Recently, S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae was reported to be associated with toxic shock-like syndrome in cattle (9), suppurative polyarthritis in lambs (28), bacteremia in dogs (66), and systemic granulomatous inflammatory disease and severe septicemia in fish (16) and in ascending upper limb cellulitis in humans in contact with raw fish (27). The presence of the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin G gene (spegg) and streptolysin S structural gene (sagA), which have been associated with invasive disease in the exclusively human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]), has been documented for fish isolates of S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (1). We have previously reported the presence of GAS phage-carried virulence genes among alpha-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae isolates from bovine mastitis, namely, the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin genes speK, speC, speL, and speM; the phage DNase I gene spd1; and other genes encoding antimicrobial resistance determinants located on mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (47). So far, no more information is available regarding the presence of GAS virulence genes among S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae strains, and nothing is known regarding the presence of GAS prophages in S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae. However, the exchange of lysogenic phages among GAS and other human and animal species, particularly group C Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (a pathogen that colonizes and infects humans with a clinical spectrum of diseases resembling those caused by GAS), Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (exclusively horse pathogen), and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus (a zoonotic pathogen) isolates, was previously reported (19, 68).The aim of the present work was to use a microarray of genes encoding GAS virulence factors (41) to have a better insight into the virulence gene pool (encoded or not by mobile genetic elements) shared between GAS and alpha-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae isolates associated with bovine mastitis in comparison with beta-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates associated with human disease.A total of 18 alpha-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae field isolates of Lancefield group C (GCS), one of the causative agents of bovine subclinical mastitis in dairy herds in Portugal, were used in the present study. Detailed information regarding these field isolates, including identification and molecular typing data, was described previously (47). In addition, six nonduplicated beta-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates of Lancefield group G (group G Streptococcus [GGS]) (n = 5) and group C (GCS) (n = 1) collected in Portugal, causing pharyngitis (n = 5) and invasive disease (n = 1) in humans, were included in the study for the purpose of comparison. The identification of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates was based on colony morphology, hemolysis in blood agar plates, and Lancefield grouping using the Streptex kit (Remel Europe Ltd., Dartford, England) and PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene and sequencing (71).We have included two invasive GCS alpha-hemolytic S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae strains in the study, which were analyzed for the detection of selected virulence genes by PCR only (see below). One of these strains was associated with toxic shock-like syndrome in cattle (9). The other strain caused ascending upper limb cellulitis in humans in contact with raw fish (27). The latter strain was previously identified (27) by PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA and sodA genes and sequencing (GenBank accession numbers {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""EU693902"",""term_id"":""189086670""}}EU693902 and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""EU719068"",""term_id"":""189397225""}}EU719068, respectively). We confirmed the identification of the strain associated with the toxic shock-like syndrome in cattle by PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA (71) and sodA (1) genes and sequencing. Sequences were analyzed by using the BioEdit sequence alignment editor (17) and compared with sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (Bethesda, MD) by using the BLAST alignment tool (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST).A description of the bovine S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae GCS field strains (n = 18), including typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), was reported previously (47). The typing of the human S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis GGS/GCS isolates (n = 6) by PFGE was carried out in this study as described previously for the bovine pathogen Streptococcus uberis (48). SmaI-digested DNA banding patterns obtained by PFGE were analyzed visually according to previously established criteria (61).The microarray was described previously (41) and was used with minor modifications. In brief, the array consists of 70-mer oligonucleotides from the conserved regions of all “classical” GAS virulence factors and orthologues of virulence factors found in other bacterial species as well as putative virulence genes present in the M1, M3, and M18 genomes. In total, 220 virulence factor/extracellular protein genes, 10 housekeeping genes (positive controls), and 10 negative controls were randomly spotted in six locations on the chip.Genomic DNA was extracted by using zirconicum beads in combination with the Qiagen DNeasy kit. Genomic DNA was partially digested with AluI, yielding fragments of between 500 and 1,000 bp, and labeled with biotin. The labeled DNA was purified (PCR purification kit; Qiagen), and the labeling efficiency was verified by gel electrophoresis. Array hybridization was performed at 42°C for 16 h, followed by incubation with streptavidin-Cy5 using a SlideBooster SB800 instrument (Advalytix). Fluorescence signals were obtained with a DNA microarray scanner (G2565CA; Agilent Technologies) at a 633-nm excitation wavelength and quantified by using ImaGene software (BioDiscovery).The raw data were corrected for background and transformed to a log scale. A two-component normal-mixture model (39) was fitted to the corrected data by a maximum likelihood method adapted from the mclust package (12). A discriminant function was calculated to represent the propensity of a gene for being present or absent. Discriminant values were stored in a signal probability matrix and colored for presentation purposes using the following scheme: black indicates state 0 (not present), green indicates state 1 (present), and yellow indicates an indecisive measurement.In order to confirm the results obtained with the GAS array, PCR was carried out on several genes (speH, speC, speA, speL, speK, speI, speM sdn, ssa, smeZ, sla, drs, prtf2, speG, ska, dppA, lbp, scpA, emm, isp, SpyM3_1736, slo, nga, spegg, and sagA). The primer sequences, gene description, and amplification length of each reaction are described in Table 1. Samples without DNA and strains lacking (negative) or carrying (positive) specific genes were used as controls in the PCR.Genes and PCR primers used for screening of virulence determinants among group C Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and group C and G Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolatesSequences of the superantigen-encoding genes speC, speK, speL, and speM of the bovine mastitis isolates under study, with high levels of identity among them, were chosen to generate an alignment of DNA sequences of the alleles of those genes and homologous sequences deposited in the NCBI database, in particular sequences of the speC, speK, speL, and speM genes of S. pyogenes; the seeL and seeM genes of S. equi subsp. equi; the szeL and szeM genes of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus; and the sdm gene of S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae.The alignment (380 bp) was used to construct a phylogenetic tree by using MEGA, version 4, software (60). The p-distance parameter and neighbor-joining method were used. Bootstrap values were calculated from 1,000 replicates. Deduced amino acid sequences from these bovine alleles were compared with similar sequences from the NCBI database by using the BLAST alignment tool (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Sequencing was performed by STAB-Vida (Lisbon, Portugal), using the same primers used for amplification. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed by using the BioEdit sequence alignment editor (17).Determination of emm gene (coding the M protein) types was performed as described by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/M-ProteinGene_typing.htm).For RNA extraction, all isolates were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (Oxoid Limited, Basingstoke, England) supplemented with 1% yeast extract (BD, Franklin Lakes) (THY) at 37°C until the mid-exponential phase was reached (optical density [OD] at 600 nm of 0.5), and the NucleoSpin RNAII kit (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by the addition of 2 U/μl of DNase I (Applied Biosystems/Ambion). RNA quality was confirmed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and images were captured by using the Gel Doc XR system and Quantity One 1-D analysis software (Bio-Rad). To confirm that no remaining DNA was present in RNA samples, PCR assays were performed by targeting the housekeeping genes rpsL and rpsB and the genes under study, speM, speK, speL, speC, spd1, sdn, slo scpA, ska, nga, lmb, isp, dppA, emm, and SpyM3_1736, using RNA as a template. Reverse transcriptase (RT) reactions for cDNA synthesis were performed by using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, New Zealand). PCR targeting of those genes under study was carried out again by using cDNA as a template.In order to ascertain if growth curves (using the same media and conditions of growth) of six of the bovine mastitis GCS S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae isolates from the present study (chosen according to their genotype) were comparable or not, an automated growth curve analysis system (BioScreen C, Piscataway, NJ) was used as described previously (6). Briefly, these isolates were grown overnight in THY, and the cells were centrifuged in order to collect 109 CFU in the pellet. After being resuspended and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mM, pH 7.0), the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, and 1% (vol/vol) of this bacterial suspension was used to inoculate each of the wells of the BioScreen plaque containing growth media. Three different growth media were tested: THY, bovine blood serum (Probiologica), and bovine milk serum freshly prepared in the laboratory as previously described (42). The growth media were prepared at different pHs (6.0, 6.6, and 7.4), and three different incubation temperatures (37°C, 38°C, and 40°C) were tested for each growth medium, which represent different environmental conditions in the bovine udder (e.g., the body temperature of a healthy cow is around 38°C, which may rise to 40°C during a mastitis infection).Eighteen virulence genes (sagA, sla, sdn, spd1, speI, speC, speA, speB, speK, speF, speM, speH, speL, speJ, ssa, smeZ, spegg, and prtf1) were searched for by PCR (Table 1) in the two invasive GCS strains that were included in the study.Microarray data have been deposited in the public ArrayExpress database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) under accession number E-MEXP-3168.Sequence data have been deposited in GenBank under the following accession numbers: {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""JF789447"",""term_id"":""339516631""}}JF789447, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""JF789445"",""term_id"":""339516627""}}JF789445, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HQ724300"",""term_id"":""326559121""}}HQ724300, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HQ724301"",""term_id"":""326559123""}}HQ724301, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HQ724302"",""term_id"":""326559125""}}HQ724302, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HQ724303"",""term_id"":""326559127""}}HQ724303, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HQ724304"",""term_id"":""326559129""}}HQ724304, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HQ724305"",""term_id"":""326559131""}}HQ724305, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HQ696925"",""term_id"":""320526708""}}HQ696925, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""JF789444"",""term_id"":""339516625""}}JF789444, {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""JF789442"",""term_id"":""339516621""}}JF789442, and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""JF789443"",""term_id"":""339516623""}}JF789443.The identification of the bovine mastitis S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae isolates was confirmed by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing as described previously (47). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of all human GCS/GGS isolates from the present study showed 99 to 100% identity to 16S rRNA gene sequences of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis deposited in the NCBI database. Taking into account the phenotypic characteristics of the isolates together with the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we could confirm the six human beta-hemolytic GGS/GCS isolates included in this study as being S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates.The 16S rRNA and sodA gene sequences of the GCS strain associated with the toxic shock-like syndrome in cattle were deposited in the GenBank database (accession numbers {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""JF789447"",""term_id"":""339516631""}}JF789447 and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""JF789445"",""term_id"":""339516627""}}JF789445, respectively), whereas the same above-mentioned sequences of the GCS strain isolated from a case of ascending upper limb cellulitis in humans were already available (accession numbers {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""EU693902"",""term_id"":""189086670""}}EU693902 and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""EU719068"",""term_id"":""189397225""}}EU719068, respectively), as described previously (27). Both 16S rRNA and sodA gene sequences of these two strains showed 99 to 100% identity with S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae 16S rRNA and sodA gene sequences available for comparison in the NCBI database.The 18 bovine S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae isolates had 15 PFGE patterns, as shown previously (47). The six S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates had six different PFGE patterns with more than six band differences and were therefore considered unrelated according to established criteria (61).None of the 18 alpha-hemolytic group C S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae bovine isolates were typed by emm typing, since no amplification for this gene could be obtained. The emm gene types of the six human S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates were as follows: stC839 (GCS isolate; n = 1), stG485, stG480, stG6792, and stG4831 (GGS isolates; n = 5).Of the 220 GAS virulence genes on the array (41), 44 genes (20%) were present in all bovine mastitis GCS (S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae) and in all human GGS/GCS (S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis) isolates, whereas 66 genes (30%) were not present in any of the isolates tested. The remaining genes (50%) showed variable distributions among isolates of both origins. Relevant genes present in at least one isolate (bovine or human) and genes present in all the bovine isolates (with the exception of hypothetical proteins) are shown in Table 2. Nine genes (ska, dppA, lmb, scpA, emm, isp, nga, slo, and SpyM3_1736) were present in all the human isolates and absent in the bovine isolates, whereas only one gene (SpyM3_0345), encoding an uncharacterized protein, was detected in all bovine isolates and absent in all human isolates.Distribution of group A Streptococcus pyogenes virulence factors of the array in bovine mastitis group C Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae isolates and human noninvasive and invasive group C or G Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates bIf we restricted the comparison to bacteriophage genes on the array, we observed that 65% of the phage-related genes were present in at least one bovine GCS isolate, whereas 35% were detected in at least one human GCS/GGS isolate. None of the 13 bacteriophage-harbored virulence genes speC, speJ, speI, speH, ssa, mf4, slaA, speA3 speK, speL, speM, spd1, and sdn were detected in human GGS/GCS S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates, whereas at least one of the six genes speC, speK, speL, speM, spd1, and sdn was detected in 72% (n = 13) of the bovine mastitis GCS S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae isolates.Other GAS genes on the array, located in variable and recombinatory loci of the GAS genomes (40, 41), were detected in both human and bovine isolates. These include the Spy2009 gene, encoding a transposase (57), and sic (at the mga chromosomal location); the SpyM18_2055 gene, coding for an amidase (at the spa chromosomal location), malE (at the maltose chromosomal location); prtF15 and sfbI (at the fibronectin-collagen-T-antigen [FCT]-encoding region); citE (at the cit chromosomal location); and epf (at the sagA chromosomal location). Interestingly, the gene coding for the adhesin R28 carried by a putative integrative conjugative element was present in all bovine and human isolates.All PCR results confirmed the GAS microarray data (Table 2), except for the speM, speK, and speG genes. The speM and speK genes share high levels of identity among their DNA sequences, which resulted in false-positive results in the array data. In addition, it was not clear how many isolates carried the speG gene by both the array and PCR amplification results. The latter may be due to a lack of homology between the primers used and the speG gene of S. dysgalactiae (named spegg), as variants of this gene may occur (73). By using other primers (designed in this study) targeting the speM and speK genes of S. pyogenes and spegg of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (73), eight bovine isolates that carried speK, one bovine isolate that carried speM, one bovine isolate that carried speK and speM, and five human isolates that carried spegg were found.Three speK alleles (speK-1Bov, speK-2Bov, and speK-3Bov) were identified among nine bovine isolates, two speM alleles (speM-1Bov and speM-2Bov) were identified in two bovine isolates, one speC allele (speCBov) was identified in six bovine isolates, and one speL allele (speLBov) was identified in four bovine isolates (GenBank accession numbers {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HQ724300"",""term_id"":""326559121""}}HQ724300 to {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HQ724305"",""term_id"":""326559131""}}HQ724305 and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""HQ696925"",""term_id"":""320526708""}}HQ696925). The phylogenetic tree based on sequences of those alleles and of homologous sequences available in the NCBI database showed four major groups, each one comprising one of the four spe genes (speK, speM, speC, or speL) of bovine S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae isolates and of S. pyogenes, as shown in Fig. 1. The tree also shows that speM and speK diverged more recently, as these two groups showed higher identities among them than with the speL or speC groups.Phylogenetic analysis of superantigen gene sequences of bovine group C Streptococcus from the present study and of sequences of S. pyogenes, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, and S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (Bethesda, MD) database. Bovine group C Streptococcus sequences from the present study are designated in the tree in boldface type. Other sequences are designated as follows: SESE, S. equi subsp. equi (seeL and seeM); SESZ, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus (szeL and szeM); SDSD, S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (sdm); GAS, S. pyogenes (speK, speM, speL, and speC). GenBank accession numbers (for bovine alleles, seeL, seeM, szeL, szeM, and sdm) and gene ID numbers (for speK, speM, speL, and speC) are included in parentheses after the gene names.Amino acid sequences deduced from the bovine GCS alleles always showed 98 to 99% identity with the homologous GAS pyrogenic exotoxin gene sequences from the NCBI database, with the exception of bovine SpeL, which showed a higher level of identity with SeeM from S. equi subsp. equi (99%) than with SpeL from S. pyogenes (96%). In particular, and interestingly, SpeM from bovine isolates in the present study showed 99% identity with SpeM from GAS and 100% identity with Sdm from S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (sequences deposited in the NCBI database).Transcriptional analysis revealed that the bacteriophage-associated virulence genes speM, speK, speL, speC, spd1, and sdn, detected in bovine GCS isolates, were transcribed and that the virulence genes ska, dppA, lmb, scpA, emm, isp, SpyM3_1736, slo, and nga, detected only in human isolates, were also transcribed.In the present study all the strains under analysis by BioScreen reached the highest OD values when grown in bovine blood serum medium (compared to those when grown in THY and bovine milk serum) and under infection-related conditions (at 40°C), with the end of the exponential phase being achieved relatively fast (prior to 5 h of incubation). In bovine milk serum, the end of the exponential phase was achieved in most cases after 10 h of incubation, whereas in THY, growth curves reached the end of the exponential phase prior to 10 h of growth, followed by long stationary phases (no OD decrease was observed during 30 h or more of growth). Interestingly, we have observed differences in growth curves among isolates from the present study, suggesting a strain-specific mode of growth.Both strains were negative for all the genes tested (n = 18) by PCR, with the exception of the sagA gene. According to the sequences available in the NCBI database, the sagA gene of the animal strain (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""JF789442"",""term_id"":""339516621""}}JF789442) showed 95% identity either with the sagA gene of S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or with that of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. In parallel, the sagA gene of the human strain (accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""JF789443"",""term_id"":""339516623""}}JF789443) was 100% identical to the sagA gene of S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and 99% identical to the sagA gene of S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis.An array containing 220 virulence genes from S. pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]) was used to analyze the virulence gene pool among S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (group C Streptococcus [GCS]) strains, associated with bovine mastitis, and among S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (group C or group G Streptococcus [GCS/GGS]) isolates, associated with human pharyngitis and invasive disease episodes. We previously reported the presence of GAS virulence genes in bovine GCS isolates (47), which motivated us to further analyze the bovine strains in a search for the presence of other GAS virulence genes (either chromosomal or encoded by mobile genetic elements). The genes included in the array used in this study are from M1, M3, and M18 GAS genomes, of which M1 and M3 in particular are usually associated with severe disease in Europe and North America (33, 53). The results showed that the genes were unevenly distributed among isolates of different host origins. The bovine GCS and human GAS isolates shared 23% of all genes, and both the human GCS/GGS and GAS isolates shared 39% of all genes. A higher content of GAS virulence genes in human GGC/GGS isolates was expected, since both species share the same tissue niche in humans and cause similar spectra of diseases (11, 22, 58). Nevertheless, and most interestingly, none of the 13 bacteriophage virulence-related genes, all associated with GAS disease, were detected in the human GCS/GGS isolates. However, 6 of those 13 genes were detected in the bovine GCS isolates, and we have observed that these GAS phage-related genes (speK, speL, speM, speC, spd1, and sdn) present in bovine GCS are expressed in vitro, suggesting that bacteriophages may also play a role in the genetic plasticity and virulence of bovine mastitis GCS S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae isolates. Specifically, the distribution of genes among the bovine GCS isolates ranged from one phage-related gene (sdn) present in three isolates to five genes (speC-speK-speL-speM-spd1) present in one isolate. Also, the observed linkage of genes in a same bovine GBS strain, in particular speC-spd1 (from the M1 phage), speM-speL (from the M18 phage), and speK (from the M3 phage), indicates polylysogeny, similarly to what was described previously for GAS (2). However, the lack of an association of sets of genes carried by complete phage genomes in our bovine isolates strongly suggests a recombinatory mosaic nature of phages, as observed previously for GAS (2).Also interesting was the observation that “non-bacteriophage-associated” genes previously shown to be located in recombinatorial and mutational hot spots of the GAS genome and thus considered to be associated with lateral gene transfer (40, 41) were detected in both the bovine GCS and human GCS/GGS isolates from the present study (Table 2). These genes (such as prtf15, epf, citE, and sic) belong to four of the five large chromosomal regions described previously to have variable loci in the GAS genome (41). One of the chromosomal regions includes the FCT locus (63), which is considered one of the major locations of adhesins in GAS isolates. Another chromosomal region is sagA, whereas another region includes the maltose transport and cit operons. The fourth region includes the mga and spa loci.Furthermore, the gene encoding the cell surface-anchored adhesin R28, carried by putative integrative conjugative elements in GAS which resemble genetic elements of group B Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) (56), was detected in all bovine and human isolates. Also, the C5a peptidase precursor scpA gene as well as the lbp gene, encoding the laminin-binding protein, both known to be carried by a composite transposon of GBS (13), were detected in all human isolates and not in bovine isolates. Together, our data highlight the importance of MGEs mediating lateral gene transfer among different streptococcal species, including bovine GCS isolates.Genes of GAS encoding adhesins, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a putative enolase, PrtF15, R28, a putative internalin A precursor, and putative fibronectin-binding protein-like protein A (4, 10, 26, 56, 69), detected in all bovine GCS S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae isolates, strongly suggest that these might represent important virulence factors in this particular subspecies. In particular, the emm gene, encoding the antiphagocytic M protein, was not present in the bovine isolates, although 94% of these isolates carried the gene encoding PAM, a member of the M protein family.Also interestingly, streptolysin S, strongly associated with invasive disease caused by GAS and associated with the beta-hemolytic phenotype of GAS and GCS/GGS (S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis) (3, 21), was detected in all bovine isolates, which are alpha-hemolytic (a sequence of this gene from one of the bovine mastitis isolates was deposited in GenBank under accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""JF789444"",""term_id"":""339516625""}}JF789444). Furthermore, the presence of the streptolysin S gene (sagA) in alpha-hemolytic strains of group G (S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis) and group C (S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae) streptococci, from human and animal origins, respectively, was reported previously (1, 72).Bovine GCS is known to grow well in mammary secretions, either during lactation or from dry animals (44, 55), which may be necessary for survival and establishment in the specific environmental niche that is the bovine mammary gland. The results obtained in the present study by using the BioScreen suggest the environmental adaptability of the bovine GCS strains, which demonstrated the ability to grow fast in bovine blood serum and also, although with lower levels of growth, in the remaining tested media (THY and bovine milk serum).GAS genes related to housekeeping functions were also detected in the bovine isolates from the present study, such as arginine deiminase, a putative metal-binding protein of the ABC transporter, a putative phosphotransferase system (PTS) IIB component, maltose/maltodextrin-binding protein, and putative ferric uptake regulator (7, 29, 32, 49, 52).The gene encoding 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase, an enzyme of glycoside hydrolase family 1 (5) associated with the capacity for carbohydrate utilization, was detected in only 39% of the bovine isolates (and absent in all human isolates). We have observed differences in growth curves among isolates from the present study, which do not seem to correlate with the presence or absence of the 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase gene. Variable growth patterns of strains in bovine mammary secretions were previously described (44) and may be related to the presence or absence of genes associated with the capacity for carbohydrate utilization but probably not of this particular gene.In epidemiologically and genetically unrelated S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strains from human disease (pharyngitis and invasive), we detected nine genes that were not detected in the bovine isolates. Out of these nine genes, five were previously described for human S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis: lbp (encoding the adhesion Lmb, a laminin-binding protein) (62), ska (encoding the plasminogen-activating Ska-streptokinase A protein) (37), slo (encoding the cytolytic streptolysin O toxin) (54), emm (encoding the M protein), as well as scpA (encoding a C5a peptidase), with the latter two genes acting on the complement pathway of the host, inhibiting bacterial opsonization and phagocytosis (8, 20). Both the lbp and scpA genes have been found in human GBS isolates and are usually absent in bovine GBS isolates (14). These latter two genes and also ska are known to be carried by a bovine pathogen, S. uberis, although Lmb is not required for the attachment of S. uberis to host epithelial cells, and the Ska locus is devoid of plasminogen activator coding sequences (70). The four remaining genes were found for the first time, in our study, in human dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates: the nga gene (encoding a GAS extracellular enzyme NAD-glycohydrolase), associated with cytotoxicity in host cells (34); the isp gene (encoding an immunogenic secreted protein), which has an unknown function, although it is known to be expressed by GAS in the human host and generates antibody responses (38); the dppA gene (encoding a dipeptide permease complex), which is a membrane-associated transporter for dipeptides in GAS and is regulated by the multigene transcriptional regulator Mga (45); and the SpyM3_1736 gene (coding for a putative ABC transporter protein). By gene expression assays (RT-PCR), we observed that all these nine genes from GAS isolates were expressed in human GCS/GGS isolates.These observations together with the absence of these nine genes in the bovine GCS isolates from this study suggest that they may be more important in human host streptococci than in animal host streptococci.The bovine alleles were distributed in the four clades according to the S. pyogenes alleles (Fig. 1). In the speK clade, the bovine alleles are organized together and separately from the seeL and szeL genes of S. equi subsp. equi and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus and the speK gene of S. pyogenes, which was expected, since the streptococcal pathogens S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, and S. pyogenes are known to share a phage pool (19). In contrast, within the speL clade, the sequences of the seeM and szeM genes of S. equi subsp. equi and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, respectively, were organized closer to the bovine speLBov allele from the present study and separately from the speL sequence of S. pyogenes, suggesting a common phage content among the animal species. Also, considering the speC clade, we may speculate that the same or a similar phage(s) is shared between bovine S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and human S. pyogenes.The reason why the seeL and szeL sequences were not located in the speL clade and the seeM and szeM sequences were not in the speM clade may be due to incorrect nomenclature given to these genes of S. equi subsp. equi and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Therefore, seeL and szeL should be named seeK and szeK, whereas szeM and seeM should be named seeL and szeL.The bovine GCS SpeM amino acid sequence (with a length of 177 amino acid residues) showed 100% identity with the S. dysgalactiae-derived mitogen (Sdm) sequence available in the NCBI database. Sdm (encoded by the sdm gene) was the only superantigen with mitogenic activity described so far for S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (43). In agreement with our findings, the authors of that study (43) also noticed high levels of identity between sdm (from S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae) and speM of S. pyogenes. sdm and speM are probably the same gene, with different nomenclatures.Our findings underline the role of GAS phages (which are known to be shared with S. equi subsp. equi and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus) in the genetic diversity of bovine S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae strains. Additionally, it would be of interest to further search for the presence and expression of virulence factors not represented on the array, which can be either present or not in the genomes of the strains tested. Since several genome sequences of streptococcal species are available, whole-genome and transcriptome comparisons using a pair of S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae strains described in the present study (the putative zoonotic strain and the bovine mastitis strain with a large pool of GAS virulence phage-related genes) would certainly give further insights into the genomic plasticity of this pathogenic subspecies.In conclusion, the presence of GAS virulence genes, particularly genes carried by MGEs, either randomly or nonrandomly distributed among strains of bovine GCS may contribute to the increased virulence potential of these strains, namely, the possibility of dissemination to different tissues of the host and to take advantage of new niches. As we have pointed out previously, S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae should not be disregarded as an infectious agent in humans. In fact, this subspecies was associated with invasive disease in humans (27) and here was shown to carry the S. pyogenes streptolysin S gene, further suggesting that S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae is an emerging zoonotic pathogen.This study was supported by project POCTI/ESP/48407/2002 (Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, Portugal)-FEDER (Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional), PROC 60839 (Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Portugal), project reference 46 (Centro de Investigação Interdisciplinar em Sanidade Animal/Faculdade de Medicina Veterinária, Universidade Técnica de Lisboa, Portugal), and CREM (Centro de Recursos Microbiológicos, Portugal).

PMC3149947,"Cell Wall Modifications in Maize Pulvini in Response to Gravitational Stress1,[W][OA]",False,"Changes in cell wall polysaccharides, transcript abundance, metabolite profiles, and hormone concentrations were monitored in the upper and lower regions of maize (Zea mays) pulvini in response to gravistimulation, during which maize plants placed in a horizontal position returned to the vertical orientation. Heteroxylan levels increased in the lower regions of the pulvini, together with lignin, but xyloglucans and heteromannan contents decreased. The degree of substitution of heteroxylan with arabinofuranosyl residues decreased in the lower pulvini, which exhibited increased mechanical strength as the plants returned to the vertical position. Few or no changes in noncellulosic wall polysaccharides could be detected on the upper side of the pulvinus, and crystalline cellulose content remained essentially constant in both the upper and lower pulvinus. Microarray analyses showed that spatial and temporal changes in transcript profiles were consistent with the changes in wall composition that were observed in the lower regions of the pulvinus. In addition, the microarray analyses indicated that metabolic pathways leading to the biosynthesis of phytohormones were differentially activated in the upper and lower regions of the pulvinus in response to gravistimulation. Metabolite profiles and measured hormone concentrations were consistent with the microarray data, insofar as auxin, physiologically active gibberellic acid, and metabolites potentially involved in lignin biosynthesis increased in the elongating cells of the lower pulvinus.Midseason root lodging in cereals can cause considerable reductions in grain yield. Depending upon the stage of development, the lodged plants may or may not attain a vertical orientation, which is important in mitigating yield loss. Even partial recovery to the upright orientation, referred to as goose necking in plant breeding, can help minimize yield losses (Dhugga, 2007). In the work reported here, we examined changes that occur when maize (Zea mays) plants are subjected to gravitational stress through placing them in a horizontal orientation.Alterations in cell wall polysaccharide composition and architecture in response to such gravitational stresses have been studied in woody plants, where responses vary between species. In gymnosperms, gravitational forces increase cell growth in the lower region of a tree branch and result in the formation of compression wood in that region. In angiosperms gravitational responses include the formation of tension wood in the upper regions of branches. Compression wood typically has thickened secondary walls in its tracheids, and higher cellulose microfibril angles and lignin contents (Wilson and Archer, 1977). In contrast, tension wood in angiosperms is characterized by a gelatinous layer in the secondary wall, in which cellulose content increases, but cellulose microfibril angle and lignin content decrease (Wilson and Archer, 1977; Andersson-Gunnerås et al., 2006).Information on changes that occur in cell wall polysaccharides in the grasses in response to gravistimulation is more limited. Gravitropic responses are initiated in leaf sheath pulvini in festucoid grasses such as barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and oats (Avena sativa), and in both leaf sheath pulvini and culm pulvini in panicoid grasses such as maize (Brown et al., 1959). Collings et al. (1998) examined the growth dynamics and cytoskeleton organization when maize shoots were subjected to gravitational stimulation by placing them in a horizontal position. These authors reported the induction of a gradient of cell elongation in different regions of stem nodes, where maximal elongation was observed in the cells of the lowermost pulvini but where negligible cell elongation was detected in the cells of the uppermost pulvini. Differential cell elongation in the lower and upper zones of the pulvinus causes the shoots to return to the upright orientation (Kaufman et al., 1987; Collings et al., 1998).At the polysaccharide level, Montague (1995) reported that [14C]Glc was incorporated into cell wall fractions in whole oat pulvini in response either to gravistimulation or upon treatment with the phytohormone, auxin. Biosynthesis of both cellulose and wall matrix polysaccharides increased in the pulvini. Furthermore, Gibeaut et al. (1990) noted that (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan content was higher in the lower pulvini than in the upper regions of oat pulvini, which was consistent with their observations that (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan synthase activities increased in the lower regions of the pulvini.If it is accepted that cells in the lower region of the pulvinus elongate at a higher rate than those in the upper pulvinus during the reorientation of plant growth from the horizontal to the vertical position (Kaufman et al., 1987; Collings et al., 1998), then one might anticipate that differential stimulation of the upper and lower regions by auxin would be involved in this process. Long et al. (2002) suggested that there is a transient gradient of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) across maize pulvinal tissue shortly after gravitational stimulation, which would support this suggestion. Auxin-induced cell elongation is known to stimulate wall loosening agents such as β-expansins, (1,4)-β-glucanases, and xyloglucan endotransglycosylases/hydrolases (XTHs; Catalá et al., 1997; Cosgrove, 2000). The β-expansins are believed to bind to noncrystalline regions of cellulose microfibrils, where they promote cell elongation by disrupting hydrogen bonding between cellulose molecules and between cellulose and other wall polysaccharides (McQueen-Mason and Cosgrove, 1995). The (1,4)-β-glucan endohydrolases catalyze the hydrolysis of cellulosic polysaccharides, while XTHs are believed to facilitate wall expansion through their action on xyloglucans (Fry et al., 1992; Nishitani and Tominaga, 1992; Rose et al., 2002). More recently it has been proposed that XTHs might not only promote wall elongation through their action on xyloglucans, but that they might also be involved in subsequent cell wall immobilization through the covalent cross linkage of xyloglucans, cellulose, and (1,3;1,4)-β-glucans (Hrmova et al., 2007, 2009; Fry et al., 2008). Roles for (1,4)-β-glucan endohydrolases and XTHs in auxin-induced cell elongation are consistent with observations that turnover rates of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucans in grasses and of xyloglucans in dicotyledons increase in response to auxin stimulation (Cosgrove, 2000).Here, changes that occur in the pulvinus during the reorientation of maize plants from the horizontal to the vertical position have been defined. Detailed temporal and spatial changes in wall composition have been monitored using linkage analysis of wall polysaccharides and chemical analyses of lignin contents. Transcriptional activities of approximately 45,000 maize genes in the upper and lower regions of the pulvinus have been monitored through microarray analyses and changes in transcript levels were consistent with changes observed in the amounts and fine structures of major wall components. The transcriptional patterns of genes involved in the interconversion of sugar nucleotides, together with metabolite profiles, could also be reconciled with changes in the relative proportions of heteroxylans and Glc-containing wall polysaccharides, and lignin. The microarray data further suggested that the transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in phytohormone biosynthesis differentially changed in the upper and lower regions of the pulvinus, and in the cases of auxin, GAs, and abscisic acid (ABA), the transcript profiles of the biosynthetic genes were shown to correspond with the actual levels of these hormones measured in tissue extracts and with the expected biological functions of the hormones.The bending capacity of maize pulvinus during the gravitropic responses observed here varied depending on the position of the pulvinus in the plant and on the age of the plant. Thus, pulvini from node 9 to node 13, where node 1 was the lowest on the plant, were responsive to gravitational stimulation in 60- to 65-d-old maize plants (Fig. 1A; Supplemental Fig. S1), while pulvini from node 8 and below did not show signs of curvature. The thickness of the pulvinus from node 10 was 9 to 11 mm on the lowermost surface in the gravitationally stimulated maize plants, but only 3 to 4 mm on the uppermost surface; the latter was the same thickness as that measured in control plants (Fig. 1B).Gravitropic response of maize stems. A Maize plant (65-d-old) was placed on the floor at an angle of about 20° for 14 d. Pulvini from nodes 9 to 13 were responsive to gravistimulation, but pulvini below node 9 did not show signs of curvature (A). Leaves have been removed to show stem curvature more clearly. The outline of a single pulvinus from node 10 is indicated by dashed lines (B). When excised, the pulvinus is a wedge-shaped disk with thin tissue on the upper region and thick tissue on the lower region. Approximately one-third of the upper region and one-third of the lower region were collected, designated as upper and lower pulvinus, and used for cell wall polysaccharide and gene expression analysis (C). The middle part of the pulvinus was discarded.The thicknesses of the upper and lower sides of stem pulvini from node 10 were correlated with the lengths of cells in these regions. Although the lengths of cells in the pulvini varied considerably, in the lower regions of pulvini in gravistimulated maize plants most sclerenchyma cells were 400 μm or longer, while in control plants most of the sclerenchyma cells in pulvini were in the range of 150 to 250 μm in length (Supplemental Table S1). Overall, the average lengths of sclerenchyma cells from node 10 were 200, 220, and 498 μm in pulvini of controls, upper regions, and lower regions, respectively. Parenchyma cells were about 3.5-fold longer in the lower pulvini than in control pulvini (Supplemental Table S1). Thus, there was a 2.5- to 3.5-fold increase in the length of these cell types, which was consistent with the differences in length of the pulvini overall, as described above. Cell elongation in leaf sheath pulvini followed the same pattern as in stem pulvini (data not shown).In both control and gravistimulated plants, pulvini from the lower nodes on the plant had a higher resistance to puncture penetration than pulvini from the top nodes (Fig. 2). In addition, the lower pulvini in the gravistimulated plants were mechanically stronger than upper pulvini, as measured by resistance to the puncture probe (Fig. 2). The upper pulvini from nodes 9 and 10 of the gravistimulated plants showed resistance to the puncture probe that was similar to control pulvini. The increase in puncture resistance in the lower pulvini was up to 30% or more in nodes 9 and 10, compared with controls (Fig. 2). In nodes 11 and 12 puncture resistance was higher in both the lower and upper pulvini compared with the controls and it may be that these nodes, being younger and weaker than nodes 9 and 10, would need to increase strength on both sides to sustain a vertical orientation in a bent plant. The increased strength might be achieved simply through the changing shape of the pulvini or through reinforcement of their cell walls.Puncture resistance of maize stem pulvini. Maize plants (65-d-old) were placed at an angle of 20° to the horizontal for 2 weeks. Puncture resistance was tested on fresh pulvini from nodes 9 to 12, using a puncture probe. Pulvini from control plants that had not been subjected to gravistimulation were also tested.There was a substantial, statistically significant increase in lignin content of approximately 40% in the lower pulvinus of nodes 9 and 11 in gravitationally stimulated maize stalks (Fig. 3A), compared with the upper pulvinus. The increase in lignin on the upper side relative to the control was not statistically significant. There was also a significant increase in ester-linked ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid on the lower side of the pulvinus (data not shown), but whether these phenolic acids were linked with lignin or polysaccharides such as heteroxylans is not known.Lignin and crystalline cellulose contents in maize stem pulvini. Maize plants were subjected to gravitropic stimulation for 2 weeks. Cell walls were prepared for the determination of lignin (A) and crystalline cellulose (B) contents. Lignin was assayed by the modified Klason method, while crystalline cellulose was measured by acetic/nitric acid digestion. Cellulose content deduced from the linkage analysis (Table II) produced compatible results with this acid digestion method.Monosaccharide linkage analyses showed no significant difference in cellulose content in control, upper, and lower stem pulvini, as determined by levels of (1,4)-glucosyl residues in the cell wall preparations (Tables I and ​andII),II), and this was confirmed using acetic acid/nitric acid procedures (Updegraff, 1969; Fig. 3B). Similarly, no significant differences were detected in the levels of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan, pectic arabinan, or type II arabinogalactan (Table II).Maize plants were subjected to gravistimulation for 2 weeks. Pulvini from nodes 9 and 11 were harvested for determination of monosaccharide linkages (mol%). Results represent five biological replicates, each analyzed in duplicate. Values in bold are statistically significant (P < 0.05) using a Student’s t test.

Values in bold are statistically significant (P < 0.05) using a Student’s t test. AG, Arabinogalactan.However, the linkage analyses indicated that the arabinoxylan content of walls increased in the lower pulvini of both nodes, but more particularly in node 11 (Tables I and ​andII),II), where increases of about 50% were observed in total xylosyl residues in the lower pulvinus compared with values obtained for controls and upper pulvini from node 11 (Table I). This was mainly attributable to an increase in (1,4)-xylosyl residues, which represent unsubstituted backbone xylosyl residues in the polysaccharide. In pulvini from node 11, levels of both total xylosyl residues and (1,4)-linked xylosyl residues were significantly higher in the lower pulvini, compared with the upper pulvini; increases were less pronounced in node 9 where increases in both the upper and lower pulvinus were observed (Table I). Consistent with the increases in (1,4)-linked xylosyl residues, total arabinosyl residues decreased in lower pulvini from node 11 and this was at least partly attributable to a reduction in terminal arabinosyl residues (Table I). This resulted in an increase in ratio of xylosyl to arabinosyl residues from about 2.0:1 to about 3.9:1 in the lower pulvini from node 11 (Table I). As noted above, the changes in pentose sugar contents in pulvini from node 9 were not as pronounced as in pulvini from node 11, but they nevertheless moved in the same direction. It is important to note that the amounts of terminal arabinofuranosyl derivatives were generally close to the total amounts of substituted xylopyranosyl derivatives, namely the levels of (2,4)-, (3,4)-, and (2,3,4)-xylopyranosyl derivatives (Table I). The latter correspond to 2-, 3-, and (2,3)-substituted xylosyl residues of the (1,4)-xylan backbone of the polysaccharide. This indicated that most of the substituents on the xylan chain were arabinosyl residues but we acknowledge that some glucuronosyl substituents might be present.Mannosyl residues decreased in the lower pulvini from both nodes, and the analyses indicated that (1,4)-linked mannosyl residues were largely responsible for these decreases (Table I).When the linkage analysis data were used to estimate the relative abundance of different classes of polysaccharides in the walls of the upper and lower pulvini, the results indicated that levels of heteroxylans increased by about 35% in the lower regions of pulvini in node 11, and that galactoglucomannans and xyloglucans decreased by about 50% and 30%, respectively, in lower pulvini of node 11; it should be noted that the levels of galactoglucomannans and xyloglucans in the walls were relatively low (Table II). The (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan contents of the walls were also low and no significant changes occurred in the levels of this polysaccharide (Table II).In the interpretations suggested above for the data presented in Tables I and ​andII,II, it is important to emphasize that only values that are statistically significant to the P < 0.05 level, which are indicated in bold font in the tables, were considered.As noted above and shown in Table II, the major change observed in cell wall composition in the pulvini of gravistimulated maize stalks was an increase in arabinoxylan content on the lower side of the pulvini. Biosynthesis of heteroxylans requires at least three activated sugar nucleotides, namely UDP-d-glucuronate, UDP-l-arabinose (UDP-Ara), and UDP-d-Xyl (UDP-Xyl). Key enzymes in the synthesis and interconversion of sugar nucleotides for cell wall biosynthesis are UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (UGPP), UDP-Glc epimerase (UGE), UDP-Glc dehydrogenase, UDP-d-glucuronate epimerase (UGAE), UDP-Xyl synthase (UXS), and UDP-Xyl epimerase (Zhang et al., 2005; Sharples and Fry, 2007; Reiter, 2008).Microarray data analysis showed that UGPP, UGE, UGAE, and UXS genes were all up-regulated by more than 2-fold in the lower pulvini 24 h after the initiation of gravistimulation, based on the relative abundance of specific mRNAs (Table III). Eight probes on the microarray corresponded to UGPP genes. One of the UGPP genes (probe 4201585) showed a significant increase in mRNA levels in lower pulvini from both stems and leaves at 24 h (Table III; data for leaves not shown).The values are fold changes compared with control. Significant changes (>2-fold and P < 0.05) are indicated in bold. Functions of genes were analyzed according to Hayes et al. (2010) and are shown in the Annotation column with GeneBank numbers in parentheses. Note that the value of 28.8-fold for the increase in UGE transcripts in the lower pulvinus at 6 h was not significant because of large variation between replicates.One of the seven microarray probes for UXS genes (probe 4241027) detected increases of 2.2-fold and 4.1-fold in mRNA levels for the gene in lower stem pulvini at 6 and 24 h, respectively (Table III). Although there was an increase in transcript level of this gene in upper pulvini at 1 h, this had returned to control levels by 24 h (Table III). The increases in abundance of UXS gene transcripts implied increased production of UDP-Xyl and UDP-Ara.The microarray contained approximately 40 probes for cellulose synthase (CesA) genes, including ZmCesA1, ZmCesA2, ZmCesA4, ZmCesA5, ZmCesA6, ZmCesA8, ZmCesA9, ZmCesA11, and ZmCesA12. No significant differences between transcript levels in upper and lower pulvini could be detected for any of the ZmCesA genes (Supplemental Fig. S2), and this was consistent with the similar levels of cellulose in walls of the upper and lower pulvini (Table II; Fig. 3B). There were two probes on the microarray for the cellulose synthase-like CslF genes that have been implicated in (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan biosynthesis (Burton et al., 2006). Transcript levels for these CslF genes were very low and did not change significantly in any of the samples analyzed, which was consistent with the low and essentially unchanged levels of (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan in the walls (Table II). There was no probe for the CslH gene on the microarray; the CslH gene has also been implicated in (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan synthesis (Doblin et al., 2009). The CesA, CslF, and CslH genes are all members of the family glycosyltransferase2 (GT2) group of GTs (Cantarel et al., 2009; http://www.cazy.org/).More than 36 GT probes were included on the microarray and are named here according to the GT family to which they belong (Cantarel et al., 2009; http://www.cazy.org/). A family GT8 GT gene was transcribed at significantly higher levels than controls in both the upper and lower pulvini, and at different times after the imposition of the gravitational stress. In the upper pulvinus, levels of the GT8 gene transcripts decreased after 6 h (Table IV) but returned to control levels at 24 h. Three family GT61 GT genes, some of which are believed to encode β-1,2-xylosyltransferases, showed quite different changes in transcript patterns. One (probe 4304503) showed increased transcription of the corresponding gene after 24 h in both the upper and lower pulvinus, while another (probe 4308259) showed increases only in the lower pulvinus after 24 h, and after 1 h in the upper pulvinus (Table IV). Transcripts for the third family GT61 gene (probe 4285578) increased 2-fold in the lower pulvinus, but remained unchanged in the upper pulvinus (Table IV). Finally, a gene encoding a GT34 enzyme was transcribed at high levels after 1 h only, but in both the upper and lower pulvinus (Table IV).The values are fold changes compared with control. Significant changes (>2-fold and P < 0.05) are indicated in bold.As discussed above, the degree of substitution of heteroxylans with arabinofuranosyl residues decreased in walls of the lower pulvinus following gravistimulation. Arabinofuranosidases from several families of glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) catalyze the removal of α-arabinofuranosyl groups from the (1,4)-β-xylan backbone of arabinoxylans (Cantarel et al., 2009). Three probes on the microarray were annotated as arabinofuranosidase genes. Transcriptional activities of two of these genes (probes 4295907 and 4292768), both of which belong to family GH51 and are likely to be arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolases (Lee et al., 2001), did not change significantly in either the upper or lower pulvini (Table V). However, mRNA levels of the other gene (probe 4211175), which encodes a GH3 family enzyme, increased substantially in the lower pulvinus at 24 h (Table V). Thus, the changes in this transcript are consistent with the decreased arabinosyl content of the arabinoxylan in the lower pulvinus (Tables I and ​andIIII).The values are fold changes compared with control. Significant changes (>2-fold and P < 0.05) are indicated in bold.Ten features on the microarray were identified as (1,4)-β-xylan endohydrolase inhibitor genes. The mRNA level of one of these genes (probe 4291762) increased substantially in both lower and upper stem pulvini (Table V). Transcript levels of another xylanase inhibitor gene (probe 4217504) were significantly higher in the lower pulvinus at 6 h (Table V). Both genes encode xylanase inhibitors of the XIP class and belong to the GH18 family (Cantarel et al., 2009).Enzymes and nonenzymic proteins such as polysaccharide endo- and exohydrolases, XTHs, and expansins have been implicated in cell wall loosening during cell growth in plants (Catalá et al., 1997; Cosgrove, 2000; Hrmova et al., 2009). Thirteen probes were annotated as either endo- or exo-β-d-glucanase genes on the microarray. The mRNA level of a family GH9 gene (probe 4314428) increased significantly in lower stem pulvini, but not in the upper pulvinus (Supplemental Table S2). A family GH3, putative β-glucosidase gene (probe 4250320) also showed increased transcriptional activity in the lower pulvinus, but not in the upper pulvinus (Supplemental Table S2). Eleven probes were identified as GH17 (1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase genes on the microarray. One of these (probe 4297356) showed a significant increase in mRNA levels in the lower pulvinus (Supplemental Table S2). Thirty-four probes were annotated as encoding (1,3)-β-glucanase genes of the GH17 family. Two of these (probes 4240483 and 4218229) showed a significant increase in transcript levels in the lower pulvinus (Supplemental Table S2). Another two (probes 4279302 and 4302273) showed increased transcription in both lower and upper pulvini (Supplemental Table S2).Forty-one microarray probes were annotated as β-expansin genes. Four (probes 4224980, 4258316, 4259490, and 4271529) showed more than 4-fold increases in transcript levels in the lower pulvinus (Supplemental Table S3). An additional two probes with the same accession number as probe 4259490 also indicated increases in β-expansin transcripts in lower pulvini (data not shown). Another two of the putative β-expansin genes (probes 4222177 and 4280874) showed increased transcriptional activities in both lower and upper pulvini. One putative β-expansin gene (probe 4307195) showed decreased transcription activity in both the upper and lower pulvini (Supplemental Table S3).Nineteen of the microarray features encoded family GH16 XTH genes. One (probe 4278710) showed a significant increase in transcript levels in the lower pulvinus (Supplemental Table S4), while another (probe 4265553) showed increased transcriptional activity in both the lower and upper pulvini. Two probes with the same GenBank accession number were annotated as a family GH16 xyloglucan (1,4)-β-glucan endohydrolases (probe 4238076). Transcripts of this gene increased in both the lower (6 h) and upper (1 h) pulvinus (Supplemental Table S4).Microarray analyses showed that of more than 50 probes representing lignin biosynthetic genes (Supplemental Table S5), levels of mRNA for a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) gene (probe 4245740) increased significantly (P < 0.05) 1 h after the commencement of gravistimulation, in both the lower and upper pulvini (Supplemental Table S5). Transcripts for this gene remained 2.4-fold higher in the lower pulvinus at 24 h, compared with control plants, but returned to control levels in the upper pulvini during this time. Transcripts of a cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) gene (probe 4268958) increased substantially after 1 h in upper pulvini. Similarly, putative hydroxycinnamoyl transferase gene transcripts appeared to increase early after gravistimulation (probe 4229300). In each of these three cases, increases in transcript abundance was higher in the upper pulvinus (Supplemental Table S5), which can be contrasted to the actual measurements of lignin content, which showed higher levels in the lower pulvinus (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this, transcript levels for three peroxidase genes (probes 4267626, 4213200, and 4225259) increased in the lower pulvinus, usually 6 to 24 h after the initiation of gravistimulation (Supplemental Table S5).Among the genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, mRNA levels for anthranilate 5-phosphoribosyltransferase (probe 4250382) increased about 2.7-fold in lower stem pulvini at 6 h and remained high at 24 h, but did not change in the upper pulvinus (Table VI). No changes in transcription levels were found for other genes involved in auxin biosynthesis. The transcript levels of an auxin conjugate hydrolase gene (probe 4282474) increased 12- to 40-fold in both lower and upper pulvini at 1 h, but returned to control levels at 6 h (Table VI).The values are fold changes compared with control. Significant changes (>2-fold and P < 0.05) are indicated in bold.Transcripts of an ent-kaurene synthase gene (probe no. 4308055), which encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of ent-kaurene from geranylgeranyl diphosphate during GA biosynthesis (Hedden and Kamiya, 1997), increased 3- to 4-fold in both upper and lower stem pulvini 6 h after gravistimulation (Table VI). Transcript levels of a GA 20-oxidase gene (probe 4218360) increased more than 3-fold at 1 h and remained high at 24 h in the lower pulvinus (Table VI). Although the mRNA level of the GA 20-oxidase gene also increased at 1 and 6 h, it had decreased to control levels by 24 h. The increase in transcription of a GA 2-oxidase gene (probe 4235513) was more than 13-fold at 1 h and remained high at 6 h in both upper and lower stem pulvini (Table VI). However, the mRNA level decreased to control levels in the upper pulvinus but remained high in the lower pulvinus at 24 h.The microarray included probes of putative violaxanthin deepoxidase, molybdenum cofactor sulfurase, and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, which are enzymes involved in the ABA biosynthetic pathway. In addition, genes encoding ABA 8-hydroxylase and cytochrome 450 monooxygenase, which are involved in ABA catabolism, were represented on the microarray. Of these genes, mRNA of an ABA hydroxylase gene (probe 4316583) increased substantially in both upper and lower pulvini (Table VI).The transcripts of a cytokinin (CK) oxidase gene (probe 4296711) increased by more than 4-fold in both lower and upper pulvini at 6 h (Table VI), remained high in the lower pulvinus, but returned to control levels in the upper pulvinus at 24 h. Another CK oxidase gene (probe 4291827) showed increased transcription, but only in the lower pulvinus. There were no changes in transcripts of CK biosynthetic genes.As an indication of ethylene metabolism in the gravitationally stimulated pulvini, transcript levels of two 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase genes were monitored with the microarray. The mRNA levels of one of these genes (probe 4286393) was about 7-fold higher in upper than lower pulvini at 1 h (Table VI), while the mRNA level of the other ACC synthase gene (probe 4205461) was higher in lower pulvini (Table VI). When mRNA levels of two ACC oxidase genes (probes 4291681 and 4266528) were measured, both were 10-fold higher in the upper pulvinus than in the lower pulvinus (Table VI).To confirm the microarray analyses, changes in transcript levels of selected genes were monitored in upper, lower, and control pulvini by quantitative-PCR, using experimental and data normalization procedures described by Burton et al. (2004). The direction and approximate quanta of changes in transcript levels were confirmed for all genes analyzed, and some examples are presented in Supplemental Figure S2.The changes in mRNA levels described above for genes that have been implicated in the synthesis and degradation of various phytohormones suggested that temporal and spatial changes were occurring in hormone concentrations. To check this, the actual concentrations of a range of auxins, CKs, ABA, and GA were measured in tissue extracts, together with related metabolic intermediates and conjugated forms of these hormones. Ethylene was not measured in the experiments described here.Pulvinus from control maize plants contained 100 to 130 ng/g dry weight IAA, but this was almost halved after 1 h gravistimulation. However, IAA levels increased to 300 and 460 ng/g dry weight at 6 h after gravistimulation in upper and lower pulvini, respectively (Table VII). Levels of IAA conjugates including IAA-Ala, IAA-Asp, IAA-Leu, and IAA-Glu were very low, with less than 10 ng/g dry weight in the maize pulvinus (Table VII; data not shown except IAA-Glu).Hormone concentrations (ng/g DW) were measured in control (con), upper (Upp), and lower (low) pulvini at 0, 1, and 6 h. IAA-Glu, N-(indole-3-yl-acetyl)-Glu; t-ZOG, (trans) zeatin-O-glucoside; c-ZOG, (cis) zeatin-O-glucoside; nd, not detectable.Maize pulvini contained 150 to 200 ng/g dry weight ABA in control plants, while in response to gravistimulation, ABA levels decreased slightly at 1 h in the upper pulvinus and increased by 2- and 6-fold at 6 h in upper and lower pulvini, respectively (Table VII). However, high levels of ABA degradation products were also detected at 6 h in the lower pulvinus. Dihydrophaseic acid (DPA) was the major ABA metabolite in the pulvinus (Table VII). Its level was 7- to 9-fold higher than other ABA metabolites (Table VII). The levels of 7’-hydroxy ABA and 9’-hydroxy ABA were extremely low.GA4 and GA7 are active hormones derived via the non-13-hydroxylation pathway from metabolites of GA12, GA15, GA24, and GA9, while GA1 and GA3 are also active hormones, but are derived from the early 13-hydroxylation pathway in which GA53, GA44, GA19, and GA20 are intermediate metabolites (Hedden and Kamiya, 1997; Hedden and Phillips, 2000). Only GA9 and GA4 from the non-13-hydroxylation pathway were quantifiable by the hormone profiling method. Gravistimulation increased GA4 and GA9 from undetected levels to about 17 and 50 ng/g dry weight in the lower pulvinus at 6 h, respectively. All four metabolites from the early 13-hydroxylation pathway were quantified. The GA53 metabolite, which initiates the early 13-hydroxylation pathway (Hedden and Kamiya, 1997), increased in upper pulvini 6 h after gravistimulation. However, it decreased sharply in the lower pulvinus at 6 h (Table VII). Further, GA20 was undetectable in control and upper pulvini but increased to about 40 ng/g dry weight in the lower pulvinus. The levels of GA44 and GA19 did not change in the lower pulvinus after gravistimulation.The maize extracts contained substantial amounts of cis-zeatin (cZ; Veach et al., 2003), which is converted to cZ-O-glucoside (cZOG) as a storage conjugate by cZ-O-GT. The cZOG was most abundant in maize pulvini, while the level of transzeatin-O-glucoside (tZOG) was about 8-fold lower than cZOG in maize pulvini (Table VII). There were no differences in levels of tZOG and cZOG in control, upper, and the lower pulvinus. Isopentenyladenosine (iPA) and transzeatin riboside levels were very low in control, upper, and lower pulvini. Active cZ was not detected by the hormone profiling method used here.Metabolite profiles were compared in the upper and lower regions of pulvini from node 10 at 12 and 24 h after the plants were placed in the horizontal position and a summary of changes observed at 24 h is presented in Figure 4. A relatively small number of metabolites changed significantly after 12 h, including phosphorylated sugars of central metabolic pathways, Phe, and ethanolamine (Supplemental Table S6; Supplemental Fig. S3). More pronounced changes in metabolites occurred 24 h after gravistimulation, when substantial increases in Glc-6-phosphate, Fru, Tyr, Phe, Met, Cys, Ala, oxaloacetate, malate, succinate, citramalate, mannitol, and uracil were detected in lower pulvini (Fig. 4; Supplemental Table S6; Supplemental Fig. S3). These changes are consistent with, but not necessarily indicative of, increased sugar metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, increased protein biosynthesis, and increased synthesis of monolignols. It is possible that increased tricarboxylic acid cycle activity and protein synthesis would be required for the increased cell elongation observed in the lower pulvini, and that the increased Phe and Tyr levels were related to the increased lignin content in lower pulvini (Fig. 3A). The increase in inositol at 12 but not 24 h is consistent with reports by Perera et al. (1999), who showed that an initial increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate returned to base levels by 30 h after gravistimulation.Changes in metabolic levels in maize stem pulvini. Maize plants were subjected to gravistimulation for 24 h. Pulvini were collected and ground on liquid nitrogen. The metabolites were extracted and analyzed by GC-MS.In the experiments described here, maize plants in pots were subjected to gravitational stress by placing them in an essentially horizontal position. Responses to this stress were monitored for 2 weeks and the kinetics of the plant’s overall growth responses were similar to those described by Collings et al. (1998). After 2 weeks the tops of the plants had returned to the vertical orientation through differential growth of the stalk pulvini of the upper four nodes (Fig. 1, A and B). Measurements of cell length in the pulvini indicated that realignment of the plant to the vertical orientation was attributable mainly to enhanced cell elongation in the lower pulvinus, rather than to higher rates of cell division. For a more comprehensive description of the molecular changes underpinning this process, approximately one-third of the upper and lower pulvini were excised as shown in Figure 1 for analyses of cell wall polysaccharide composition, gene transcriptional patterns, metabolite profiling, and for the quantitation of phytohormone levels.Gravistimulated cell elongation in the lower region of maize pulvinus was accompanied by increased mechanical strength (Fig. 2) and substantial modifications of some cell wall components. The most noticeable changes were the increases in lignin (Fig. 3A) and arabinoxylans (Table II) in walls of the lower pulvinus. The increases in lignin content of 50% or more in the lower pulvinus (Fig. 3A) were consistent with its potential role in increasing the compressive strength of plant walls (Gindl and Teischinger, 2002; Bonawitz and Chapple, 2010), as observed in the compression wood of gymnosperms (Wilson and Archer, 1977). Heteroxylans play key structural roles in the matrix phase of cell walls from both dicots and monocots, but are especially abundant in walls of the Poaceae (Carpita, 1996; Fincher, 2009; Scheller and Ulvskov, 2010). Levels of heteroxylans increased about 35% in the lower pulvinus of gravistimulated maize plants (Table II). Cellulose, which together with arabinoxylan accounts for 70% to 80% by weight of the walls (Table II), did not change significantly in either the upper or lower pulvini of the gravistimulated maize stalks and this is consistent with the observations of Lu et al. (1992) in gravistimulated pulvini of oats. It is noteworthy that the absolute levels of cellulose assayed via the acetic acid/nitric acid method are in the range 35% to 40% by weight (Fig. 3B), while those deduced from the linkage analyses are in the range 50% to 55% by weight (Table II). The discrepancy between these values is probably attributable, in part at least, to differences in the units of expression of cellulose content. In the acetic acid/nitric acid method, cellulose is expressed as a percentage of total cell wall weight (the ethanol insoluble residue), which contains lignin, while in the linkage analysis, it is expressed as a percentage of measured monosaccharides, not including lignin. The discrepancy could also be partly attributable to different forms of cellulose. Crystalline cellulose is measured by the acetic acid/nitric acid method, while both crystalline and noncrystalline cellulose will be measured in the linkage analyses (Burton et al., 2010b). Levels of the minor components of the walls, namely the heteromannans, xyloglucans, and (1,3;1,4)-β-glucans, appeared to be similar or slightly lower in the walls of the lower pulvini of the plants (Table II).Although the genes that mediate arabinoxylan biosynthesis have not been defined unequivocally, comparative bioinformatics analyses led Mitchell et al. (2007) to conclude that genes encoding enzymes in the GT43 family encode (1,4)-β-xylan synthases that are responsible for the synthesis of the (1,4)-β-xylan backbone of the polysaccharide, GT47 family genes encode the (1,2)-α- or (1,3)-α-l-arabinosyl transferases that add arabinosyl residues to the backbone, and GT61 family genes encode feruloyl-arabinoxylan (1,2)-β-xylosyl transferases. Mortimer et al. (2010) have recently shown that the glucuronyl transferases that add α-glucuronosyl residues to the backbone of (1,4)-β-xylans are members of the GT8 family of glycosyl transferases. In the microarray analyses performed here on the straightening maize stalks, transcript abundance of genes from the GT8, GT34, and GT61 families increased in the lower pulvini, where arabinoxylan contents increased (Table IV). The GT8 family includes, in addition to the xylan α-glucuronyltransferase mentioned above, a large number of galactosyl and glucosyl transferases (http://www.cazy.org/; Cantarel et al., 2009). Similarly, the GT34 family includes galactomannan α-1,6-galactosyltransferases and xyloglucan α-1,6-xylosyltransferases (http://www.cazy.org/; Cantarel et al., 2009). Whether these particular enzymes are involved in arabinoxylan synthesis in the lower pulvini of gravistimulated maize plants is not known at this stage. It is also possible that the increases in arabinoxylan content in walls of the lower pulvinus result from decreased (1,4)-β-xylan endohydrolase activity. Although we did not detect changes in mRNAs for (1,4)-β-xylanase genes, enzyme activity was not measured but might be modulated by GH18 (1,4)-β-xylanase inhibitors of the XIP group. The transcript profiles did indicate that levels of (1,4)-β-xylanase inhibitors increased in the lower pulvinus (Table V).Perhaps the most important observations with respect to the composition of the cell walls in the pulvini were that the fine structure of the arabinoxylan changed and that the changes could be reconciled with the increased strength of the lower pulvini. More specifically, the degree of substitution of the arabinoxylan with arabinofuranosyl residues decreases markedly in the lower pulvinus, particularly in node 11 (Table I), which appears to have the highest angle of curvature (Fig. 1A). This is reflected in higher levels of (1,4)-xylosyl residues, fewer terminal arabinofuranosyl residues, and a higher Xyl:Ara ratio (Table I). There is evidence in the literature that the arabinoxylans of the Poaceae are initially synthesized in a highly substituted form, in which almost all of the backbone xylosyl residues are substituted with arabinofuranosyl residues (Reid and Wilkie, 1969; Gibeaut and Carpita, 1991; Scobbie et al., 1993; Gibeaut et al., 2005; Jung and Casler, 2006; Burton et al., 2010a). Following deposition into the wall, arabinfuranosyl residues are removed enzymatically in a manner that leaves some open, unsubstituted regions of the (1,4)-β-xylan backbone and other regions with various patterns of arabinofuranosyl substitution (Viëtor et al., 1992; Burton et al., 2010b). Enzymes that have been implicated in the removal of the arabinofuranosyl residues include family GH3 α-arabinofuranosidases and family GH51 α-arabinofuranosidases; the latter are sometimes referred to as arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolases (Harvey et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2001, 2003). Micorarray analyses confirmed that transcription of one member of the GH3 α-arabinofuranosidase gene family increased markedly in the lower pulvinus during gravitational stimulus (Table V).The removal of arabinosyl substituents from the arabinoxylan will alter the physicochemical properties of the polysaccharide and its behavior within the wall through increasing the abundance and length of unsubstituted regions of the (1,4)-β-xylan backbone. These unsubstituted regions of (1,4)-β-xylan will facilitate hydrogen bonding between neighboring arabinoxylan chains and between arabinoxylans and other wall polysaccharides, such as cellulose, (1,3;1,4)-β-glucans, and xyloglucans (Fincher, 2009). On this basis one would expect the changes observed in the fine structure of the arabinoxylan to increase the intermolecular binding in the wall and hence mechanical strength of the lower pulvinus, consistent with the puncture resistance data (Fig. 2). One might further speculate that the changes in the amount of arabinoxylan and its structure might contribute positively to the compressive strength of the wall, given that the changes occur on the lower side of the gravistimulated pulvinus and that increases in lignin are also observed in the lower pulvinus. Despite the fact that maize stalk strength is correlated with cellulose rather than lignin content (Appenzeller et al., 2004) and that cellulose-enriched tension wood is found on the upper side of tree branches (Andersson-Gunnerås et al., 2006), it was noteworthy that cellulose concentrations in walls did not change significantly in any part of the pulvinus (Fig. 3B) and no significant changes in CesA transcript levels were detected.The transcript analyses revealed changes in the activity of a number of other genes that are involved in cell wall synthesis, wall loosening and remodeling, and wall degradation. First, the microarray data suggest that transcript levels of genes encoding sugar nucleotide interconverting enzymes altered in a manner consistent with the channelling of more carbon through the sugar nucleotide pathway overall via increased transcription of the UGPP gene, and the nonreversible commitment of carbon to UDP-Xyl and UDP-Ara formation through the action of UXS. In each case these changes can be rationalized with the increases observed in the increased arabinoxylan contents in the cell walls of the lower pulvinus (Table II).Second, levels of mRNA for several β-expansin genes increased from 4- to 27-fold in the lower pulvinus (Supplemental Table S3), while mRNA for two XTH genes of the GH16 family increased 5- to 11-fold in the lower pulvinus (Supplemental Table S4). Both β-expansins and XTHs have been implicated in cell wall loosening, which would be required for differential elongation of the cells on the lower side for the plant to achieve an upright configuration (Fry et al., 1992; McQueen-Mason and Cosgrove, 1995). Changes in the degree of polymerization of wall polysaccharides have been observed in auxin-treated pea (Pisum sativum) stem (Talbott and Ray, 1992). The XTHs might also catalyze the formation of covalent linkages between different wall polysaccharides (Hrmova et al., 2007, 2009; Fry et al., 2008) and, if so, this could contribute to the increased mechanical strength of walls in the lower pulvinus, as discussed above. Levels of mRNA encoding several GH17 (1,3)-β-glucanase genes also increased, in some cases up to 27-fold, in the lower pulvinus of the gravistimulated maize plants (Supplemental Table S2). These enzymes, which are encoded by large gene families in the Poaceae (Xu et al., 1992), have several functions, including roles in wound responses and plant-pathogen interactions, but the reason these genes are up-regulated to such an extent in the lower pulvinus is not yet clear. It is of interest to note that certain β-expansin, XTH, and (1,3)-β-glucanase genes appeared to be transcribed in a highly coordinate manner in response to gravitational stress (Fig. 5).Coordinate expression of genes involved in cell wall loosening. Gene expression was analyzed using the microarray. The numbers indicate probe numbers and gene annotations are shown in parentheses. The data are expressed as the ratio of signal strength in different tissues: L/C, Lower pulvinus over control pulvinus; U/C, upper pulvus over control; L/U, lower pulvinus over upper pulvinus. Expression of all these genes were higher in lower pulvini than in upper pulvini, from both leaf sheath and stem at 24 h.The increased abundance of mRNA for GH17 (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan endohydrolases in the lower pulvinus (Supplemental Table S2) might be responsible for the decrease in (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan in the walls of the lower pulvinus, although the decrease is small in absolute terms (Table II). These enzymes are active in vegetative tissues of barley and appear to be under hormonal control (Slakeski and Fincher, 1992). The small but significant decreases in (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan content in the walls of the lower maize stalk pulvinus can be contrasted to increases in (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan content of walls in the lower leaf sheath pulvini of detached segments of oat stems (Gibeaut et al., 1990). These differences are probably attributable to significant differences in the experimental procedures used to impose the gravitational stress.The microarray results for genes involved in lignin metabolism (Supplemental Table S5) are not easily explained, because the levels of transcripts for genes encoding certain CCR and C4H enzymes increase significantly in the upper pulvinus, where lignin levels are essentially unchanged. These enzymes are involved in the synthesis of monolignol precursors of lignin and increases in their transcripts might be expected to lead to increases in lignin levels or to changes in lignin composition (Bonawitz and Chapple, 2010). Metabolite profiles do not clarify the situation, because increases in Phe are observed in both the upper and lower pulvinus, while Tyr increased only in the lower pulvinus (Fig. 4); both amino acids would be expected to feed more carbon into the monolignol biosynthetic pathways. Lignin levels increased in the lower pulvini after 2 weeks of gravistimulation (Fig. 3A) but we did not monitor lignin levels during the first 2 weeks of gravistimulation. Collings et al. (1998) reported that wall lignification does not occur in the lower stem pulvinus of gravity-induced stalk bending in maize until the pulvinus loses its capacity to bend further. Thus, actual lignin deposition may have occurred sometime after the observed changes in transcripts and metabolites discussed above.The microarray data proved to be useful as an indicator of changes in hormone concentrations in the pulvini of the maize plants examined here. Changes were observed in mRNA levels for genes that mediate phytohormones synthesis, release from conjugated forms, and degradation. When these data were cross checked against the actual levels of common hormones extracted from the upper, lower, and control pulvini, changes in transcript abundance could usually be reconciled with changes in hormone concentrations, although ethylene could not be measured in the plant material used for the microarray analyses (Tables VI and VII).Auxin (IAA) is generally associated with cell elongation (Bartel, 1997) and would therefore be expected to mediate the elongation of cells observed in the lower pulvinus. Although there were few changes in genes involved in auxin synthesis at 1 h, hydrolases that have been implicated in IAA conjugate hydrolysis (Long et al., 2002) increased substantially in both the upper and lower pulvini at 1 h, but returned to control levels at 6 h (Table VI). Maize vegetative tissues contain up to 13-times higher concentrations of esterified IAA conjugates than free IAA (Bandurski and Schulze, 1977) and the increase in IAA concentration in the lower pulvinus at 6 h presumably resulted from the action of the auxin conjugate hydrolases (Table VII). It appears there might have been a pause in auxin synthesis or redistribution in the first hour, perhaps to adapt to stress, but auxin subsequently increased as expected, more so on the lower side than the upper side of the pulvinus. One might speculate that this reflects the redistribution of auxin efflux carriers (PIN proteins) after the plants were placed in a horizontal position (Noh et al., 2003; Petrásek et al., 2006). No changes were observed in mRNA levels for the 10 PIN genes measured by the microarray.Transcript levels of the anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase gene, which is involved in auxin biosynthesis, increased about 2.7-fold in the lower pulvinus but remained essentially unchanged in the upper pulvinus (Table VI). Similarly, mRNA for two auxin response factors increased more than 2-fold in the lower pulvinus, while mRNA for the Aux/IAA protein, which suppresses the auxin response, decreased at 6 h in the lower pulvinus. Based on these data, auxin levels would be expected to be higher in the lower pulvinus at 6 h, and this was indeed observed (Table VI).In the case of ABA, which normally functions as a general growth inhibitor (Nambara and Marion-Poll, 2005), the increase in transcription of the 9 cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase gene observed in lower pulvini at 1 h would be expected to increase ABA levels. However, the increase in cytochrome P450 monooxygenase transcription in lower pulvini at 6 h would result in an increase in ABA degradation, as would the high levels of ABA 8’-hydroxylase mRNA in upper pulvini. ABA is inactivated by 7’-, 8’-, and 9’-hydroxylation pathways. The 8-hydroxylation reaction is believed to be the most important regulatory step in physiological responses to ABA, and phaseic acid (PA) and DPA are usually the most abundant ABA catabolites (Nambara and Marion-Poll, 2005). This is supported by this work, where it is clear that levels of the ABA conjugate, ABA-Glc ester (GE), remained at similar levels in all the samples (Table VII), indicating that there was little conjugation of ABA occurring in ABA turnover, and that the majority of ABA was metabolized through 8’-hydroxylation.Although there were few changes in ABA and ABA metabolites at 1 h, measured levels of ABA, PA, and DPA all increased at 6 h, especially in the lower pulvinus (Table VII). Given the inhibitory functions of ABA in cell elongation, together with the fact that ABA levels are determined by a precise balance between biosynthesis and catabolism of the hormone (Nambara and Marion-Poll, 2005), it is difficult to interpret the increased levels of ABA in the lower pulvinus (Table VII), where cell elongation is occurring at a rapid rate. One explanation of this observation relates to the conventional dogma that ABA functions as a growth inhibitor, which is not always the case. In seed development, ABA promotes deposition of storage products and Sharp and LeNoble (2002) have shown that ABA plays an important role in limiting ethylene production and further suggest that ABA might promote growth of corn seedlings through an involvement with ethylene signaling.It is also possible that the ABA concentrations observed in tissue extracts here are related to GA levels, given that ABA and GA often act as antagonists. The functions of GA are extensive, but include the promotion of stem elongation (Hedden and Kamiya, 1997). On this basis one might expect active GA levels to be higher in the elongating cells of the lower pulvinus. Transcript levels of ent-kaurene synthase, which is involved in GA12-aldehyde biosynthesis, increased in both the upper and lower pulvini, as did the levels of mRNA for a number of GA oxidases (Table VI). The GA 20-oxidase enzyme catalyzes successive oxidations of C-20 methyl groups of GAs in non-13-hydroxylation and early 13-hydroxylation pathways (Hedden and Kamiya, 1997). The non-13-hydroxylation pathway generates active GA1 and GA3, while the early 13-hydroxylation pathway produces active GA4 and GA7. However, there were also substantial increases in GA intermediates such as GA53 at 6 h (Table VII) in the upper pulvinus, but GA53 decreased significantly in the lower pulvinus. This indicated a clear difference in GA metabolism in the two regions of the straightening maize pulvini. Overall, the GA forms that increased in the lower pulvinus were GA4, GA9, and GA20 and, although these were not the most abundant forms of GA, they might be the active forms or the immediate precursors of active forms in the elongating cells of the lower pulvinus (Table VII).CKs, which generally promote cell division rather than cell elongation, were also measured in the pulvini of the maize plants. Active CKs include iPA, tZOG, cZOG, and dihydrozeatin (Sakakibara, 2006). These are synthesized by a chain of reactions catalyzed by phosphatases, adenosine kinases, and adenine phosphoribosyltransferases. CKs are inactivated by cleavage of side chains with CK oxidases and CK dehydrogenases. Given that we did not detect high levels of cell division in either the upper or lower pulvini, one might expect either decreased synthesis of the hormone or its more rapid degradation. At the transcript level, the microarray analyses showed that mRNAs for CK oxidases 2 and 3, which remove CKs, were significantly elevated in the lower pulvini at 6 h (Table VI). This would suggest a reduction on active CK levels in the lower pulvini, consistent with cell elongation without associated cell division in these regions of the gravistimulated maize stalks. Transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in CK biosynthesis, such as adenine phosphoribosyl transferase, did not appear to change significantly in the upper or lower pulvini. Despite the apparent increases in transcriptional activity of genes involved in CK degradation in the lower pulvinus (Table VI), we could not detect any significant changes in active CK levels measured in tissue extracts (Table VII).Finally, changes were detected in transcripts of ACC synthase and ACC oxidase genes normally associated with ethylene biosynthesis (Table VI), although we were not able to measure ethylene concentrations in extracts of the maize pulvini. We conclude from these data that ethylene levels might be elevated in both regions of the pulvinus, but particularly in the upper pulvinus (Peck et al., 1998). It is clear that the changes in transcript levels of these two genes occur much earlier after gravistimulation than do those associated with ABA, GA, and auxin metabolism. Ethylene has been implicated in many biological functions, including gravitropic responses and growth inhibition (Peck et al., 1998; Visser and Pierik, 2007), but its precise mode of action in the pulvinus of gravitationally stressed maize stalks cannot yet be defined in detail, although it appears it might initiate a stress response in the affected zone of the stalk. The 4- to 5-fold increase in mannitol and sorbitol is consistent with this stress on the lower side of the pulvinus.In summary, we have quantitated a significant number of changes that occur in the pulvinus of maize plants subjected to gravitational stress, and have summarized the major changes diagrammatically in Figure 6. Important cell wall modifications occur during gravistimulated cell elongation in the lower regions of stem pulvini in gravistimulated maize plants. Fine structural changes in wall arabinoxylans can be correlated with observed increases in tissue strength in the lower pulvinus, as can increases in lignin content. Microarray analyses of RNA preparations from the upper and lower pulvinus, and from control pulvini, were largely consistent with changes in wall composition. The microarray data also suggested that changes in the levels of several phytohormones were responsible for these changes in the wall, but the actual measurement of hormone levels in extracts of pulvini demonstrated the complexity of the hormone biosynthetic and degradative pathways. Thus, the assays supported previous work on the extensive cross talk that occurs within and between the complex signaling networks, and underscored the fine balance of phytohormone levels and distribution within the gravistimulated pulvinus.Summary of changes occurring in maize pulvini during gravitational stress. Hormones mediate changes in cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis and increases in stem strength in the lower maize pulvinus. Maize stems contained abundant IAA ester conjugates. An increase of IAA conjugate hydrolase (IAA con hyd) mRNA at 1 h indicated that storage IAA was mobilized upon gravistimulation, which subsequently mediated changes in several classes of cell wall metabolic gene expression. These included nucleotide sugar interconversion genes, cell wall loosening genes, GTs, and arabinofuranosidases (AF). A consequence was an increase in unsubstituted heteroxylan, lignin, and eventually stem strength. However, ethylene or the balance of ethylene with other phytohormones might play a role in an inhibition of cell wall changes and cell elongation in upper pulvinus, as indicated by the substantial increases in expression of ACC synthase (ACC syn) and ACC oxidase (ACC oxi) genes in both upper and lower pulvinus at early gravistimulation.Maize (Zea mays) plants (O9B) were grown in a glasshouse at 17°C/27°C under natural light conditions and were subjected to gravistimulation when the tip of primary cob was first visible (60–65 d from sowing) by placing on floors at approximately 20° angle. The maize plants were placed on the floor with leaves protruding from both sides. Stem pulvini were dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately for RNA, metabolite, and cell wall preparation. One-third of pulvinus from both the top and bottom regions was excised and designated as upper and lower pulvini, respectively (Fig. 1B). The central part of the pulvinus was discarded. For control plants, which were not subjected to gravistimulation, one-third of pulvinus was collected from either side of pulvinus and pooled. The central part of the disk was also discarded.Pulvini were ground on liquid nitrogen and extracted with 80% ethanol five to seven times. The ethanol-insoluble residues were extracted with acetone and methanol once each and dried in a dessicator with dried silica gel. The ethanol-insoluble residues were used for cellulose, lignin content, and polysaccharide linkage analysis. Cellulose was determined according to Updegraff (1969) with modifications as described in Burton et al. (2010b).Klason lignin was determined as described by Theander and Westerlund (1986) with the following modifications. Approximately 20 mg of the ethanol-insoluble residues of cell wall preparations (in duplicate) was hydrolyzed with 0.2 mL 12 m sulphuric acid for 1 h at 35°C, which was then diluted to 2 m and the sample heated at 121°C for 1 h. The hot acid-insoluble residue was collected on preweighed 25-mm 542 Whatman filter paper discs using a Whatman 1225 sampling manifold (Whatman Asia Pacific). The filters were washed in place with water and dried in a vacuum oven (40°C) overnight before weighing.Monosaccharide linkage analysis was performed on five biological replicates by methylation with methyl iodide in sodium hydroxide and dimethyl sulfoxide as described by Ciucanu and Kerek (1984) followed by acid hydrolysis, reduction, and acetylation as described in Sims and Bacic (1995). Monosaccharide linkages and relative polysaccharide proportions were deduced from the partially methylated alditol acetates that were separated and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described by Zhu et al. (2005).Pulvini from the uppermost and lowermost surfaces of maize stems were sectioned longitudinally and examined under a light microscope. Cell length was measured using Image-Pro Plus software (MediaCybernetics, Inc.) after calibrating with a cytometer.Maize pulvini from node 10 were ground in liquid nitrogen. Metabolites from five biological replicates were extracted and derivatized with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroaceteamide + 1% tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and analyzed by GC-MS according to Jacobs et al. (2007).The value of each compound was calculated on a weight basis relative to internal standards. The fold differences between control and upper or between control and lower pulvini were calculated relative to the appropriate time point control. Only those metabolites that were statistically significant (P < 0.05) are listed in Supplemental Table S6.Maize plants were harvested 2 weeks after the imposition of the gravitropic stress and the leaf sheath was pealed to reveal the pulvinus. A small punctual probe was mounted on the Instron 5543 single column testing system (Instron) and flexure stress at maximum load was determined with a flat-faced, tungsten puncture probe of 1-mm2 surface area and an anvil movement rate of 100 mm/min. The penetration was set to stop when the peak penetration load dropped by 30%.Maize pulvini were freeze dried and homogenized. Qualification of auxin, ABA, GA, and cytokine metabolites in maize pulvini was conducted at the Plant Biotechnology Institute of the National Research Council of Canada by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface (http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/facilities/pbi/plant-hormone.html). Deuterated forms of the hormones were used as internal standards. These included d3-DPA, d5-ABA-GE, d3-PA, d4-7′-OH-ABA, d3-neoPA, d4-ABA, d4-trans-ABA, d3-IAA-Leu, d3-IAA-Ala, d3-IAA-Asp, d3-IAA-Glu, d5-IAA, d3-dhZ, d3-dhZR, d5-Z-O-Glu, d6-iPA, and d6-2iP, and d2-GAs 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 19, 20, 24, 29, 34, 44, 51, and 53. They were either synthesized according to Abrams et al. (2003) and Zaharia et al. (2005) or purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Olchemim Ltd., and Research School of Chemistry, Australian National University. Hormones were extracted with isopropanol/water/glacial acetic acid (80:19:1, v/v), purified, and quantified according to Abrams et al. (2003).Maize pulvini were ground under liquid nitrogen and total RNA extracted with the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Polyadenylated mRNA was purified using the Illustra mRNA purification kit (GE Biosciences). Sample quality and RNA concentration were assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. The mRNA was transcribed into double-stranded cDNA, which was amplified and labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dye, all using the Agilent Low RNA linear amp kit. Biological replicates were labeled alternately using Cy3 or Cy5 to guard against dye bias. The cRNA was hybridized to Pioneer’s custom 105 k microarrays that contained 103,685 oligonucleotides for about 45,000 maize genes (Hayes et al., 2010) and the microarrays were washed according to Agilent standard protocols. The microarray chips were scanned with an Agilent G2505B DNA microarray scanner at two laser power settings (100% and 10%). The images were inspected visually for image artifacts, and feature intensities were extracted, filtered, and normalized with Agilent feature extraction software (v 9.5.1). The data were normalized using quantile normalization (BOLSTAD, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12538238). The normalized data were used to compare expression levels of genes related to cell wall and phytohormone metabolism. The microarray data have been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus under series accession number {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE26071"",""term_id"":""26071""}}GSE26071 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and platform accession number {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GPL10837"",""term_id"":""10837""}}GPL10837 (Hayes et al., 2010). Of the approximately 45,000 gene probes on the microarray, about 4.6% of those with functional annotations were related to metabolic pathways leading to sugar nucleotides, to wall polysaccharide synthesis, modification and degradation, to lignin metabolism, and to other cell wall components.The following materials are available in the online version of this article.Supplemental Figure S1.

PMC3160020,Maize opaque5 Encodes Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Synthase and Specifically Affects Galactolipids Necessary for Amyloplast and Chloroplast Function[C][W][OA],False,"The maize (Zea mays) opaque5 (o5) locus was shown to encode the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase MGD1. Null and point mutations of o5 that affect the vitreous nature of mature endosperm engendered an allelic series of lines with stepwise reductions in gene function. C18:3/C18:2 galactolipid abundance in seedling leaves was reduced proportionally, without significant effects on total galactolipid content. This alteration in polar lipid composition disrupted the organization of thylakoid membranes into granal stacks. Total galactolipid abundance in endosperm was strongly reduced in o5- mutants, causing developmental defects and changes in starch production such that the normal simple granules were replaced with compound granules separated by amyloplast membrane. Complete loss of MGD1 function in a null mutant caused kernel lethality owing to failure in both endosperm and embryo development. The data demonstrate that low-abundance galactolipids with five double bonds serve functions in plastid membranes that are not replaced by the predominant species with six double bonds. Furthermore, the data identify a function of amyloplast membranes in the development of starch granules. Finally, the specific changes in lipid composition suggest that MGD1 can distinguish the constituency of acyl groups on its diacylglycerol substrate based upon the degree of desaturation.Maize (Zea mays) mutations that cause opaque kernel phenotypes are of interest because of their effects on seed texture and nutritional quality traits. The phenotype is defined by kernels that appear opaque to transmitted light, as opposed to the partially translucent appearance of normal vitreous seeds. At least 18 opaque gene loci are known, some of which are involved in storage protein metabolism (Thompson and Larkins, 1994; Hunter et al., 2002). The opaque2 (o2) locus, for example, encodes a transcription factor that activates genes coding for α-zein proteins, thus changing the constituency of protein bodies made in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and present in mature endosperm after desiccation (Kodrzycki et al., 1989; Schmidt et al., 1990). Another example is floury1, which encodes a membrane protein involved in targeting an α-zein to the interior of protein bodies (Holding et al., 2007). Macromolecular assembly of protein bodies is highly complex (Holding and Larkins, 2009), possibly explaining why opaque loci are identified frequently. In many instances, however, the cause of the phenotype appears to be unrelated to protein composition. For example, altered starch composition conferred by waxy1 mutations causes kernel opacity (reviewed in Coe et al., 1988). Similarly, mutations of the o5 locus condition opaque kernels without notable changes in total protein content, zein versus nonzein ratio, or amino acid composition (Hunter et al., 2002).In this study, o5 was found to code for a glycosyl transferase that generates monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). MGDG and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) are the primary nonprotein components of plastid membranes, providing both structural and functional organization. Together, these galactolipids account for as much as 80% of total polar lipid content in plastids (Block et al., 1983; Dörmann and Benning, 2002; Hölzl and Dörmann, 2007). Galactolipid-based membranes are conserved features of organisms that undergo oxygenic photosynthesis, including Chloroplastida and cyanobacteria. Direct functions in photosynthesis are possible because specific galactolipids appear as ligands in three dimensional structures of photosynthetic complexes (Jordan et al., 2001; Loll et al., 2007). In addition, owing to its nonbilayer forming properties, MGDG is likely to provide membrane structure in areas of tight turns and high protein packing density (Webb and Green, 1991; Bruce, 1998; Lee, 2000; Dörmann and Benning, 2002). Nonphotosynthetic plastid membranes also contain MGDG and DGDG in high abundance, so galactolipid function is not restricted to light harvesting or electron transfer. Most higher-plant MGDG has a C18/C18 molecular structure, with an 18:3 fatty acid at both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone. Some plants also contain MGDG with C18/C16 structures (Heinz, 1977; Maréchal et al., 2000). The C18/C18 species are thought to be derived from the ER lipid assembly pathway using fatty acids exported from the plastid, whereas C18/C16 lipids arise from the organellar lipid assembly pathway (Benning, 2008).The enzyme MGDG synthase (MGD) (UDPgalactose: 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-β-d-galactosyl-transferase; EC 2.4.1.46), located in plastid envelope membranes, catalyzes transfer of a galactosyl residue from UDPgalactose to the sn-3 position of diacylglycerol (DAG) (Dörmann and Benning, 2002; Benning and Ohta, 2005). MGD activity has been studied most extensively in Arabidopsis thaliana, spinach (Spinacia oleracea), and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) (Joyard and Douce, 1987; Shimojima et al., 1997; Maréchal et al., 2000). MGD enzymes in these plants are divided into type A and type B classes based on amino acid sequences as well as enzymatic and physiological properties. The type A enzyme (MGD1) is targeted to the inner plastid envelope membrane, whereas the two type B enzymes (MGD2 and MGD3) are localized to outer envelope membranes (Maréchal et al., 2000; Awai et al., 2001). MGD1 is expressed in all plant tissues and is the most abundant form in chloroplasts, whereas MGD2 and MGD3 are detected primarily in nonphotosynthetic tissues, including flowers and roots (Awai et al., 2001; Kobayashi et al., 2004). MGD2 and MGD3 are induced by phosphate starvation, suggesting they function in specific conditions, whereas MGD1 appears to serve a general role in galactolipid biosynthesis based on its constitutive expression pattern (Awai et al., 2001; Kobayashi et al., 2004).In Arabidopsis, the hypomorphic point mutation mgd1-1 conditioned chlorotic plants that exhibit ~50% reduction in chlorophyll (Jarvis et al., 2000). MGDG content was reduced to ~42% of normal, although total leaf lipid content was similar to the wild type. Chloroplasts were underdeveloped in the mutant, with reduced numbers of starch granules. The null allele mgd1-2 conditioned a near absence of both MGDG and DGDG as well as disruption of the photosynthetic plastid membranes, leading to a loss of photosynthetic ability for the plant (Kobayashi et al., 2007). Embryo development also was impaired in mgd1-2 mutants and the seeds were white, indicating that galactolipids have an essential role in embryogenesis (Kobayashi et al., 2007). These results indicate that neither MGD2 nor MGD3 compensates for loss of MGD1 in Arabidopsis.This study characterized the effects of reducing or eliminating MGD1 function in leaves and endosperm of maize, a C4 monocot. The finding that mutations affecting MGD1 cause an opaque endosperm phenotype reveals a connection between membrane structure and storage compound metabolism in nonphotosynthetic plastids. Additionally, a hypomorphic o5- allele specifically affects abundance of minor MGDG or DGDG species with five double bonds in the two acyl groups combined. This seemingly subtle change in lipid structure, with essentially no reduction in the total galactolipid content, is physiologically significant. The data further reveal that acyl group identity can be a factor for MDG1 enzyme activity. In an o5 null mutant, as was observed in Arabidopsis, maize embryo development is aborted at an early stage, indicating that galactolipid function is essential in nonphotosynthetic and photosynthetic tissue.The mutation o5-Ref, which causes visually distinctive opaque kernel and pale green virescent seedling phenotypes (Figures 1A and ​and1B),1B), was first described by Robertson in 1967 (www.maizegdb.org). Other mutations that cause opaque kernels were subjected to complementation tests by crossing heterozygous mutants to homozygous o5-Ref plants. In three instances, ~50% of the progeny kernels were opaque, thus identifying new o5- alleles. These mutations, termed o5-PS3038, o5-5288, and o5-313328, condition various kernel and seedling phenotypes (summarized in Supplemental Table 1 online).Kernel and Seedling Phenotypes.(A) o5-Ref kernel phenotype. Mature kernels from a self-pollinated ear of an o5-Ref/+ heterozygote were photographed under reflected light (black background) or backlit by a transilluminator (white background).(B) Seedling phenotypes. Kernels of the indicated genotype were planted in the greenhouse, and seedlings were photographed 7 d after emergence.(C) o5-PS3038 kernel phenotype. A portion of a self-pollinated ear from an o5-PS3038/+ heterozygote is shown. Homozygous mutant kernels are variable in size, often shriveled, floury in texture, and carotenoid deficient.Both o5-Ref and o5-313328 condition pale-green, virescent seedlings that subsequently acquire full green color and develop apparently normally through maturity. Homozygous kernels bearing either mutation are opaque and slightly pale compared with yellow kernels of the congenic wild-type inbred W64A but germinate normally and exhibit near-normal morphology. The o5-5288 allele causes a stronger phenotype with white seedlings that fail to acquire green color and die 7 to 14 d postemergence. The kernel morphology of o5-5288 homozygotes is white and shrunken. The mutation o5-PS3038 is the most severe in this allelic group because it conditions defective kernels that fail to germinate. Mutant kernels observed on a segregating ear from a self-pollinated o5-PS3038/+ heterozygote are white and frequently severely shrunken (Figure 1C). The latter two mutations must be maintained as heterozygotes because homozygous individuals are nonviable.Another allelic combination examined in this study is the o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 compound heterozygote. Such kernels are lighter in color and slightly collapsed at the crown compared with homozygous o5-Ref kernels. Seedlings grown from these kernels remain chlorotic and die within 2 weeks of emergence (Figure 1B), similar to o5-5288 homozygotes.Transposon tagging was used to identify the o5 locus. As described previously, a Mu8 transposable element insertion was found tightly linked to the o5 locus (Yi et al., 2009). Briefly, an o5-PS3038/+ heterozygote was crossed to an o5-Ref homozygote to generate a population segregating 1:1 for o5-PS3038/o5-Ref mutant and +/o5-Ref normal offspring. As expected, approximately one-half of the kernels on such ears displayed the opaque phenotype. DNA isolated from mutant and normal seedlings was subjected to a high-throughput transposon display method called MuTA. A unique amplification product containing a Mu8 terminus and flanking genomic DNA was identified in all four o5-PS3038/o5-Ref mutant DNA samples and was absent in all four +/o5-Ref normal samples. The sequence of this product matched exactly to a published EST (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""EE189213"",""term_id"":""149107332""}}EE189213). Gene-specific primers from this sequence were used in combination with a Mu-end primer to amplify that specific Mu insertion. Forty-eight additional segregants from the cross were thus analyzed, and perfect cosegregation was observed, indicating this Mu8 insertion is linked to, and potentially causal of, the o5-PS3038 mutation (Yi et al., 2009).The genomic sequence adjacent to the Mu insertion associated with o5-PS3038 is within the locus that codes for a protein annotated as MGDG synthase type A (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""EU954700"",""term_id"":""195609975""}}EU954700), referred to here as MGD1. The transcribed region of this gene is located on chromosome 7.02 between nucleotides 117,701,235 and 117,708,502 of the B73 reference genome version 2, which as expected is near or at the inferred position of the o5 locus (Andorf et al., 2010). Mu8 is inserted into the first exon, 441 bases 3′ to the presumed initiation codon (Figure 2A). The effect of this mutation on the MGD1 mRNA level was examined by RT-PCR amplification of RNA from wild-type and mutant kernels from an ear of a self-pollinated o5-PS3038/+ heterozygote. Wild-type samples yielded an obvious amplification product when the PCR primers flanked the insertion site, whereas only a trace signal was evident in the mutant kernels (Figure 2B). Product from mutant kernels was most likely derived from pericarp tissue, which is maternal and, thus, heterozygous for a wild-type o5 allele. A primer pair located 3′ to the Mu insertion generated an obvious PCR product in both mutant and wild-type kernels. This suggests spurious transcript initiation from within the Mu element, as has been described previously for other Mu-induced mutations (Barkan and Martienssen, 1991).Characterization of the o5 Locus.(A) Locus structure. Introns are shown as solid lines, exons as boxes, and untranslated regions as gray boxes. Mutation sites are indicated. Small arrows indicate the locations of oligonucleotide primers used in RT-PCR analyses in (B) and (C). The figure is drawn to scale except for intron 7, which is ~3.1 kb. The top diagram maps the transcript that appears most frequently in EST data, and the bottom diagram maps an alternative transcript that fails to remove intron 7 and uses a different 3′ end processing site.(B) Transcript accumulation in o5-PS3038 kernels. MGD1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in wild-type (WT) and o5-PS3038/o5-PS3038 kernels (designated o5-) harvested from a segregating ear at 15 DAP. Primers locations are shown in (A). The ubiquitin (uq) gene transcript was used as a positive control. M, molecular weight standards.(C) Transcript accumulation in o5-313328 kernels. Analysis as in (B).(D) Phylogenetic relationship of MGD genes. The o5 gene product (shown as Zm MGD1) was aligned with MGD proteins from maize, rice, Arabidopsis, the moss Physcomitrella patens, and the diatom P. tricornutum. GenBank protein accession numbers are listed in Methods.The gene encoding MGD1 was examined in three other o5- allelic mutants (see Supplemental Table 1 online). MGD1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced from homozygous o5-Ref, o5-5288, and o5-313328 plants as well as from wild-type inbreds W64A, Oh43, and B73. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified that caused amino acid substitutions specifically in o5-Ref and o5-5288 mutants. In o5-Ref, a G/T transversion at nucleotide 1511 (numbering according to GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""BT042676"",""term_id"":""194707193""}}BT042676) would change the residue at position 430 from a Gly to a Cys. This Gly is invariant in MGD coding sequences among vascular plants, moss, and species as divergent as the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (see Supplemental Figure 1 online) (Botté et al., 2005). cDNA clones from o5-5288 seedlings contained two substitutions in MGD1 relative to the wild type. A G/A transition at nucleotide 504 would cause substitution of the Gly at residue 94 by Asp, and an A/G transition at nucleotide 653 changes the invariant Met codon at position 144 to a Val. Invariant residues are usually essential for protein function, indicating that the nonconservative amino acid substitutions in o5-Ref and o5-5288 are likely to impair MGD1 enzyme activity.Changes in the gene encoding MGD1 were also detected in plants carrying o5-313328 (see Supplemental Table 1 online). Homozygotes for o5-313328 did not display any differences from the wild type in the full-length MGD1 cDNA sequence; however, genomic DNA contained a deletion of 79 bp in intron 7 that was not detected in any wild-type line. RT-PCR with primers spanning the seventh intron consistently generated decreased amounts of amplification product compared with normal, whereas primers that amplified an alternatively spliced and presumably nonfunctional transcript exhibited an increased signal (Figures 2A and ​and2C).2C). This suggests that splicing of intron 7 is less efficient than normal owing to the deletion associated with o5-313328.In summary, plants carrying four independent o5- alleles were altered in the gene encoding MGD1. Together with the fact MGD1 coding sequences could not be separated from the o5 locus, the data demonstrate that o5 codes for MGD1.Genomics data (http://www.plantgdb.org and http://www.maizeGDB.org) revealed that the transcribed region of o5 spans ~7267 bp, including eight exons and seven introns (Figure 2A). The longest identified mature transcript (GenBank accession number {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""BT042676"",""term_id"":""194707193""}}BT042676) comprises 2188 bp with 1589 bp of coding sequence and noncoding regions of 223 and 374 bp at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The full-length protein product is predicted to contain 529 amino acid residues, including a 53-residue plastid transit peptide predicted by the TargetP algorithm (Emanuelsson et al., 2007). The predicted molecular mass of mature MGD1 is 51.7 kD.The full-length amino acid sequence contains a conserved glycosyl transferase (GT) domain classified as family GT28 according to the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (Cantarel et al., 2009), whose members are predicted to exhibit the conserved GT-B structural fold (Lairson et al., 2008). This structure comprises residues 151 to 482 of the full-length MGD1 sequence, so an amino terminal extension of ~98 residues is attached to the catalytic domain in the mature protein. The first half of the GT domain is further classified as an MGDG synthase domain, denoted as structure PF06925 in the Pfam database (Finn et al., 2010). Maize MGD1 is 86% identical to Arabidopsis MGD1 from residues 137 to 519 of the full-length sequence, with no gaps in the alignment. Sequence identity between maize and Arabidopsis MGD1 from residues 1 to 136 is much less but still significant, with 32% identical amino acids over 120 aligned residues, including four gaps.o5 is one of three loci in the maize genome coding for predicted MGDG synthases. The other two genes, mdg2 and mdg3, are located on chromosomes 5 and 1, respectively. MGD1 groups phylogenetically with type A MGD synthases, whereas MGD2 and MGD3 are related more closely to type B enzymes (Figure 2D). National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) annotation of the MGD2 and MGD3 genes is discrepant between maize and rice (Oryza sativa), hence, the apparent nonconcordance in the phylogeny. As a type A MGD synthase, maize MGD1 would be predicted to be expressed widely throughout the plant. This was tested by RT-PCR amplification of MGD1 mRNA from seedling shoot, root, juvenile and adult leaf tissue, tassel, ear, kernels at various developmental stages, endosperm harvested 20 d after pollination (DAP), and 20 DAP embryo. Signals were evident in all tissues tested (Figure 3A), supporting classification of MGD1 as a type A enzyme.RT-PCR Analysis of Transcript Levels.(A) Expression of MGD1 mRNA in wild-type tissues. RNA from the indicated tissues was amplified using primers specific for the MGD1 transcript. The ubiquitin (uq) or ISA2 transcripts were used as controls. M, molecular weight standards. W, no template control. Shoot and root were from seedlings. Ear tissue was from early development when the organ was ~2 mm in length. Whole kernels were analyzed at the indicated days after pollination. L2, leaf from two-leaf seedlings; L6, youngest leaf of six-leaf seedlings; L6M, mature seedling leaf defined as the outer one-third of the third leaf of six-leaf seedlings. Endosperm and embryo were from kernels harvested 20 DAP. In the top panel, primers 3 and 4 were used to amplify cDNA, and in the bottom panel, the primers were F and R. The locations of the primers are shown in Figure 2A.(B) Expression of MGD1, MGD2, and MGD3 mRNAs in wild-type and o5-Ref tissues. Total RNA from endosperm or leaf was amplified using primers specific for the indicated transcript. The ISA2 transcript provided a positive control. M, molecular weight standards; WT, wild-type inbred W64A; o5-, plants homozygous for o5-Ref; W, no template control.Polar lipids from seedling leaves and developing endosperm were characterized to test whether MGD function is altered in o5- mutants and to further define the effects of these mutations. Organic extracts were analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify and quantify individual phospholipids and galactolipids (Welti and Wang, 2004) (complete data set in Supplemental Data Set 1 online). The molar percentage of total galactosyldiacylglycerol (GDG) was ~42% in wild-type endosperm, whereas in seedlings, the GDG content was ~92% (Figure 4A). The distribution between MGDG and DGDG differed between the tissues, with monogalactosyl species constituting approximately one-third of total GDG in endosperm and two-thirds in seedling leaves (Figure 4A). The great majority of GDG in both endosperm and leaf were C18/C18 species (Figure 4B), and thus are expected to be derived from the ER assembly pathway (Benning, 2008). Among the C18/C18 GDG species, there were major differences between wild-type tissues in the degree of desaturation of the acyl groups. Endosperm contained predominantly 36:4 lipid, with ~13% 36:5 species and essentially no 36:6 lipids. Leaf tissue, conversely, contained predominantly 36:6 GDG species and very little 36:4 lipid. The 36:5 GDG content was similar in leaf and endosperm (Figure 4B).Lipid Content.(A) Galactolipid species abundance in leaf and endosperm of the wild type and o5- mutants. MGDG, DGDG, and total GDG abundance is plotted as the molar percentage of total polar lipid. Values are averages of independent biological replicates (W64A endosperm, n = 4; o5-Ref/o5-Ref endosperm, n = 5; all seedling leaf tissue, n = 3; sd ≤ 2.1%). Asterisks indicate significant differences from the wild type (P < 0.01; Student's t test). Differences between o5-Ref/o5-Ref and o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 were not observed at this level of significance.(B) Degree of desaturation in galactolipids of wild-type leaf and endosperm. Galactolipid species abundance is plotted as the molar percentage of total galactolipid. Independent replicates were as in (A) (sd ≤ 0.6%).(C) Comparison of the degree of desaturation in galactolipids of wild-type and o5- mutant leaves. Galactolipid species abundance is plotted as the molar percentage of total polar lipid. Independent replicates were as in (A) (sd ≤ 1.6% for all samples and ≤0.6% for 36:5 species). Asterisks indicate significant differences from the wild-type value, and pound signs indicate significant differences from the o5-Ref/o5-Ref value (P < 0.01; Student's t test).Total GDG content in endosperm was reduced approximately fourfold in homozygous o5-Ref mutants compared with the wild type (Figure 4A), supporting the conclusion that o5 codes for MGDG synthase. Both MGDG and DGDG abundance were reduced by the mutation. The distribution between 36:4 and 36:5 GDG was essentially unchanged in wild-type and o5-Ref endosperm (see Supplemental Data Set 1 online).In contrast with endosperm, the total GDG level in leaves was not significantly altered in o5-Ref/o5-Ref homozygotes and was only slightly reduced when one copy of o5-Ref was present along with one copy of the null allele o5-PS3038 (Figure 4A). Thus, reduced total GDG level is not likely to be the cause of the leaf phenotypes. However, significant changes were noted in the abundance of 36:5 GDG species between the wild type and mutants. The total abundance of C18/C18 GDG was the same in W64A and o5-Ref leaves; however, the mutant had approximately one-half the wild-type amount of 36:5 GDG (Figure 4C). Heteroallelic o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 leaves had one-quarter of the wild-type 36:5 GDG content. Thus, the magnitude of the effect was proportional to dosage of partially functional alleles at the o5 locus. This effect was observed for both 36:5 MGDG and 36:5 DGDG (see Supplemental Data Set 1 online).Proportionality to functional gene dosage, and accordingly to phenotypic severity, was observed only for 36:5 GDG content. Other changes in polar lipid abundance were observed; however, these were quantitatively small and did not correlate with phenotype. For example, MGDG abundance was reduced slightly but significantly in both mutant lines compared with the wild type (Figure 4A). This is not the cause of the leaf phenotypes because the total MGDG level was the same in o5-Ref/o5-Ref and o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 plants, although they display very different leaf phenotypes. Changes in phospholipid content between mutant and wild-type leaves also were observed (see Supplemental Data Set 1 online); however, these are minor species comprising in total <10% of the polar lipids. Proportionality to gene dosage or phenotype was not observed for any change in phospholipid content.The greater effect of o5- mutations on total GDG level in endosperm than leaf could be explained by a compensation mechanism in the latter tissue. One possibility is that mgd2 or mgd3 expression is induced in o5- mutant leaf tissue but not in endosperm. This was investigated by examining the levels of transcripts coding for MGD using RT-PCR. MGD1, MGD2, and MGD3 transcripts were all present in both leaf and endosperm of wild-type plants (Figure 3B). The MGD1 mRNA level was not altered in either tissue by o5-Ref, consistent with identification of that allele as a point mutation. In both leaf and endosperm, MGD2 mRNA was present at the same levels in o5-Ref mutants as in the wild type. MGD3 mRNA was strongly reduced in concentration as a result of o5-Ref in both leaf and endosperm. The reason o5-Ref would affect MGD3 expression is not clear; however, the data taken together are inconsistent with the hypothesis that increased expression of MGD2 or MGD3 mRNA is the reason that o5-Ref has relatively little effect in leaf. The possibility remains that MGD2 functions in leaf but not in endosperm, despite the fact that the mRNA is present in both tissues.Endosperm characteristics were examined to investigate the nature of the opaque kernel phenotype. Homozygous o5-Ref mutants are viable, and mature kernels appeared normal except for the loss of translucency typical of wild-type maize seed (Figure 1A). Starchy endosperm tissue at mid-development (20 DAP) was abnormal, with highly vacuolated cells containing decreased numbers of starch grains that were noticeably smaller than the wild type (Figure 5A). At maturity, starch granule size in o5-Ref endosperm was similar to the wild type, although they appeared less densely packed and often compound (Figure 5B).Endosperm Development.(A) Histological sections of immature endosperm. Wild-type and mutant kernels were collected at 15 DAP from a self-pollinated o5-PS3038/+ plant and at 20 DAP from a self-pollinated o5-Ref/+ plant. A cluster of cells in o5-PS3038/o5PS3038 endosperm largely devoid of starch grains is outlined in red.(B) Histological sections of mature endosperm. Mature kernels were collected from the plants described in (A) and either fixed for histological analysis by light microscopy or embedded, thin-sectioned, and analyzed by TEM (bottom right panel). The TEM image depicts a cell from a region of o5-PS3038/o5PS3038 endosperm devoid of starch granules (bottom left panel).Homozygous o5-PS3038 mutants exhibit a defective kernel phenotype in which the seeds are small, white, collapsed to varying degrees, and have poorly developed, floury endosperms (Figure 1C). Homozygous mutant endosperm cells at 15 DAP had greatly decreased cellular contents and displayed a variety of cytological abnormalities, such as amoeboid nuclei and undefined globular structures (Figure 5A). At maturity, starch granules were evident in many cells, although they often showed highly irregular morphologies, including a dramatic enlargement and high degree of compounding (Figure 5B). Also of note were contiguous zones of cells devoid of starch grains or other recognizable structures (Figures 5A and ​and5B).5B). These vacant zones, observed at both mid-development and maturity, were not seen in wild-type endosperm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that cells in these zones were filled with many small vesicles and other bodies of unknown composition (Figure 5B).Wild-type and mutant endosperm and starch granules were further examined by TEM (Figure 6). Normal tissue revealed characteristic simple granules surrounded individually by amyloplast envelope. The compound nature of starch in mature o5-PS3038 mutant endosperm was clearly evident in TEM, with internal membranes separating individual granules packed together within a single amyloplast. Entire compound granules were surrounded on the exterior with plastid envelope. Each particle within a single plastid displayed concentric growth rings, demonstrating compound granules derived from multiple initiation events rather than fractured simple granules. Growth rings in mutant starch grains appeared to be irregularly spaced compared with the uniform rings in wild-type granules. Mature o5-Ref/o5-Ref endosperm observed in TEM also exhibited numerous compound granules but less frequently than in the null mutant. These also were surrounded on the exterior by amyloplast envelope, with interior membranes separating individual particles (Figure 6). Most granules in o5-Ref tissue were close to the wild type in size and growth ring spacing.TEM Visualization of Mature Starch Grains in Endosperm Tissue.Kernels on self-pollinated ears of o5-Ref/+ or o5-PS3038/+ heterozygotes were harvested at maturity, fixed, thin-sectioned, and analyzed by TEM. Dark-staining areas within granules are folds that arise during sectioning. Arrows indicate amyloplast envelope or internal membrane. Bars = 0.5 μm and apply uniformly within each column. Organelles are indicated: M, mitochondria; PB, protein bodies.Embryo development was also severely affected in homozygous o5-PS3038 mutants. Longitudinal sections of developing kernels harvested 15 DAP revealed that the mutant embryos attained a relatively normal transition stage morphology but failed to progress further (Figure 7). Wild-type embryos had established an axis, shoot apical meristem, and scutellum by this point.Embryo Development.Wild-type and homozygous o5-PS3808 kernels harvested from a segregating ear at 15 DAP were collected, and longitudinal sections were prepared such that both endosperm and embryo were included. Tissue sections were stained with Safranin O and fast green. Bars apply to both images in each row.Morphological abnormalities of starch granules in o5- mutants prompted more detailed investigation of starch biosynthesis. Consistent with fewer and smaller starch granules in o5-Ref endosperm at mid-development compared with the wild type (Figure 5A), the total starch content measured at 20 DAP was significantly reduced in the mutant (P = 0.02; Table 1). Water-soluble polysaccharide was elevated in the mutant at this stage by approximately sixfold compared with the wild-type level. By contrast, at maturity when o5-Ref starch granules are generally similar in size to the wild type (Figure 5B), neither the total starch content nor the water-soluble polysaccharide level was significantly altered in the mutant (Table 1). Amylose content was the same in mature starch granules from wild-type or o5-Ref/o5-Ref endosperm (Table 1).Endosperm Carbohydrate ContentStarch and water-soluble polysaccharide (WSP) content is expressed as mg/g dry weight. Values are the mean ± sd from three biological replicates. Amylose content is expressed as the percentage of total carbohydrate in purified starch.Glucan chain length distribution in amylopectin from o5-Ref and wild-type endosperm was determined using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (Morell et al., 1998; O'Shea et al., 1998). Biological replicates of starch from kernels harvested 20 DAP showed that the measured chain length distribution was highly reproducible for both wild-type and o5-Ref homozygotes (Figure 8). Compared with B73 or W64A wild-type starch, o5-Ref starch had an elevated frequency of linear chains with degrees of polymerization in the 12 to 21 range. The chain lengths that are increased in frequency constitute the crystalline lamellae of amylopectin (Buléon et al., 1998).Amylopectin Chain Length Distribution.Total starch from the indicated genotypes was debranched with commericial isoamylase, and mole percentage of linear chains of each degree of polymerization was normalized to the total number of chains from DP5 to DP48. Plots show the difference between the mole percentage of each chain length for the two indicated lines. The designations #1, #2, etc., indicate independent biological replicates of the same genotype. For comparison between genotypes (bottom row), the average values for four independent replicates of the mutant and two independent replicates of each wild-type inbred line were compared.[See online article for color version of this figure.]The assembly state of isoamylase-type starch debranching enzymes (ISA) was analyzed because mutations affecting these enzymes change amylopectin chain length frequency in the same size range that is altered in o5-Ref mutants (Dinges et al., 2001). Three bands of ISA activity are observed in extracts of 20 DAP wild-type endosperm after native-PAGE, electrophoretic transfer to a starch-containing gel, and then staining with I2/KI (Kubo et al., 2010). Endosperm of o5-Ref kernels reproducibly exhibited a fourth band of ISA activity (Figure 9). The levels of ISA1 and ISA2 protein determined by immunoblot analysis using isoform-specific IgG fractions were the same in o5-Ref and wild-type endosperm. Multiple ISA activity bands are known to result from different assembly states of the ISA1 and ISA2 proteins in multimeric complexes in both maize and rice (Utsumi and Nakamura, 2006; Kubo et al., 2010). The data suggest that the change in membrane lipid composition caused by o5-Ref results in altered assembly of one or more of these ISA complexes.Starch Modifying Enzymes.Extracts of 20 DAP endosperm were separated by native-PAGE and analyzed by zymogram. Differential color staining in I2/KI revealed changes in starch structure owing to specific enzyme activities. Blue bands result from ISA complexes and red bands from starch branching enzymes. ISA form I is known to be an ISA1 homomeric complex, whereas forms II and III are ISA1/ISA2 heteromers. The asterisk indicates the position of an ISA activity observed reproducibly in o5-Ref endosperm that is not seen in the wild type.Further microscopy characterization of photosynthetic tissue was undertaken to investigate the nature of the pale-green or colorless seedling phenotype observed in viable o5-Ref homozygotes or seedling-lethal o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 compound heterozygotes (Figure 1B). The o5-Ref mutant leaves in cross section appear similar to the wild type with regard to the number of chloroplasts present in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. The chloroplasts appear less tightly appressed to the periphery of mutant bundle sheath cells than in the wild type (Figure 10). The number of chloroplasts present in the more severely affected o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 seedlings is noticeably reduced from the wild type, particularly in mesophyll cells.Effects of o5- Mutations on Leaf and Chloroplast Morphology.Seedling leaves were fixed and sectioned for either light microscopy or TEM. The top row shows chloroplasts as dark staining bodies that appear contiguous in the bundle sheath cells. Individual mesophyll chloroplasts visualized by TEM are shown in the bottom two rows. Bars apply uniformly within each row. WT, wild type.TEM observation of individual chloroplasts revealed defects in membrane assembly that increased in severity proportional to the reduction in 36:5 galactolipid content (Figure 10). Highly organized granal stacks of thylakoid membranes were clearly observed in chloroplasts of wild-type mesophyll cells. Chloroplasts in o5-Ref/o5-Ref mesophyll had less extensive grana, and this effect was more severe in o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 plastids where internal membrane structure appeared sparse and even less organized (Figure 10). Normal bundle sheath chloroplasts also possess an organized thylakoid membrane system although they lack grana and are the major sites of transient leaf starch accumulation. The thylakoids in chloroplasts of o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 bundle sheath cells showed decreased laminar structure, and starch grains were rare and much smaller (see Supplemental Figure 2 online).The combined genetic and biochemical analyses presented here make clear that the maize o5 gene encodes a type A MGD synthase. A specific transposon within the gene that codes for MGD1 was genetically inseparable from a defined o5- mutation. Furthermore, plants carrying any of three additional independent o5- alleles also contained specific mutant variants at the locus encoding MGD1. Accumulation of direct and indirect products of MGD1 (i.e., MGDG and DGDG, respectively) is strongly reduced in endosperm tissue in mutants carrying lesions in o5. Taken together, these data demonstrate that MGD1 defects are the causative agents of the observed phenotypes in o5- mutants.Wild-type leaf and endosperm varied considerably in galactolipid content in three aspects. First, seedling leaves contained >90% GDG as a molar percentage of total polar lipids compared with 42% of total in endosperm. Second, MGDG abundance relative to DGDG was different in the two tissues, with approximately one-third of the total GDG as monogalactosyl forms in endosperm and two-thirds in leaf. Finally, the degree of desaturation was very different. About 67% of endosperm GDG was a 36:4 species (i.e., 18:2 fatty acyl groups at both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions), and this tissue was essentially devoid of 36:6 species. By contrast, leaf comprised ~80% 36:6 species, whereas 36:4 GDG was detected at only a trace level. These endosperm characteristics are consistent with previous characterization of potato (Solanum tuberosum) amyloplast membranes, which showed DGDG in excess of MGDG, and preponderance of 18:2 fatty acids relative to 18:3 species in all galactolipids (Fishwick and Wright, 1980).Maize leaf GDG content was high relative to that reported for other plant species (e.g., 60 to 70% in Arabidopsis leaves) (Dörmann et al., 1995; Jarvis et al., 2000). This discrepancy could be explained by differences in developmental stage, inherent species characteristics, or possibly the use of mass spectrometry as the detection method in this study. Regardless, GDGs are the major polar lipids present in both maize and Arabidopsis leaves. Maize GDG has ~95% C18/C18 species thought to derive from the eukaryotic pathway of GDG biosynthesis. Previous reports indicated that maize was devoid of C18/C16 GDG species (Mongrand et al., 1998 and references therein); however, the use of mass spectrometry now reveals that a minor amount of GDG biosynthesis proceeds through the prokaryotic pathway in both maize leaves and endosperm.This study characterized the effects of disrupted MGD1 function in maize, a monocot species that uses the C4 photosynthetic pathway. The o5- alleles affected lipid content in ways that were not seen previously in analysis of mgd1 mutants in Arabidopsis (Jarvis et al., 2000; Kobayashi et al., 2007), thus providing insight into functions of specific lipid species. In mutant maize leaves, the reduction in total GDG content was much less severe than that observed in Arabidopsis, even though in both instances chlorotic phenotypes were observed. Notably, there was no significant difference in total GDG content between W64A and homozygous o5-Ref leaves. In o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 compound heterozygotes, which are severely chlorophyll deficient, the total GDG decrease was 5% of the wild-type value. This compares to a total GDG decrease of 20% in hypomorphic Arabidopsis mgd1-1 mutants. With regard to MGDG specifically, mutant maize seedlings were reduced by <11% compared with the 42% reduction seen in Arabidopsis. Thus, the data reveal that photosynthetic development can be impaired as the result of less severe and more specific changes in the GDG profile than have been observed previously.Further analysis revealed that 36:5 galactolipids are specifically required for normal chloroplast structure and function and that this requirement cannot be substituted by 36:6 species. There was clear correspondence between the level of MGD1 function and 36:5 GDG content. The o5-Ref/o5-Ref line with two copies of the hypomorphic point mutation showed 50% reduction in 36:5 GDG compared with the wild type, whereas o5-Ref/o5-PS3038, with one copy of the hypomorphic allele and one null allele, was reduced 75%. Successively greater reduction in 36:5 GDG corresponded to the increasing phenotypic severity of the two mutant lines. No other parameters of lipid content exhibited such correspondence. Taken together, the data are strong evidence that 36:5 GDG deficiency causes the photosynthetic defects.The specific reduction in 36:5 galactolipids, and not 36:6 lipids, indicates molecular recognition of acyl group structure on the DAG acceptor substrate by MGD synthase(s). Galactolipid precursors with 36 carbons in the acyl groups are provided from the ER lipid assembly pathway with alkene groups already in place, prior to conversion to DAG in the plastid and subsequent glycosylation by MGD1 (Benning, 2008). Thus, reduction in 36:5 GDG content but not 36:6 GDG most likely is explained at the level of the galactosyl transferase. The alternative is that o5- mutations affect fatty acyl desaturases in the ER, which is implausible given the enzymatic function of MGD1 and its location in the inner plastid envelope. Both MGDG and DGDG were reduced in 36:5 frequency to the same extent, suggesting that DGDG synthase activity is not affected by the desaturation state of the DAG substrate. This observation is consistent with the fact that MGDG produced by MGD1 in the inner envelope is the substrate of DGD1 and DGD2 located in the outer envelope membrane (Kobayashi et al., 2007; Benning, 2008).The relatively small change in galactolipids in o5-Ref/o5-Ref or o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 leaves could result from inherent properties of the G430C mutant MGD1 enzyme and/or by compensatory activity of another MGD synthase(s). MGD1-G430C could be altered in enzymatic rate or substrate binding but not devoid of function, so that MGDG synthesis is reduced but not eliminated. This is likely because seedlings with two copies of o5-Ref apparently attain full photosynthetic capacity, whereas those with only one copy remain chlorotic and are inviable, and because 36:5 GDG content increases with two copies of the mutant allele relative to only one copy. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that MGD1-G430C is impaired in recognition of 36:5 DAG as a substrate but not 36:6 DAG. Based on molecular modeling studies, G430 is predicted to be located within the active site of MGD1, near the sites involved in binding to both the UDPGal donor and the DAG acceptor substrate (Botté et al., 2005). Thus, perturbation of DAG substrate selection owing to the G430C mutation is plausible.The possibility also exists that MDG2 could be active in maize seedling leaves so that loss of MGD1 activity has only a small effect on total MGDG synthesis. According to this hypothesis, the MGD2 enzyme would have reduced activity toward 36:5 DAG substrates relative to 36:6 DAG. MGD2 mRNA is present in seedling leaves, at the same level in either o5- or wild-type plants. MGD3 can be ruled out as a compensating enzyme because the corresponding transcript is not detected in mutant leaves. MGD2 activity cannot fully explain the slight changes in GDG levels, however, because such compensation should occur to the same extent regardless of whether one or two copies of o5-Ref are present. Compensation clearly does not occur in Arabidopsis because an mgd1 null mutation caused essentially complete absence of GDG in seedlings even though MDG2 and MDG3 transcripts were present (Kobayashi et al., 2007). Thus, partially reduced activity of the mutant MGD1 encoded by o5-Ref is responsible for the specific lipid phenotype, at least to some extent if not entirely.The o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 seedlings exhibited altered chloroplast structure attributed to deficiency of 36:5 GDG. The observed morphological defects in the plastid are more severe than those caused by the hypomorphic allele mgd1-1 in Arabidopsis (Jarvis et al., 2000) despite much smaller changes in MGDG or total GDG content. In the dicot, the amount of thylakoid membrane was substantially decreased, although the remaining membranes formed morphologically normal granal stacks. By contrast, o5-Ref/o5-PS3038 mesophyll thylakoid membrane structure was drastically altered such that normal grana were lost. An intermediate degree of thylakoid disorganization was observed in o5-Ref/o5-Ref mesophyll, supporting the conclusion that 36:5 GDG content is the determining factor. The extensive granal stacks of mesophyll thylakoid membrane are enriched in photosystem II complexes, and assembly of these complex structures apparently requires a minimal amount of 36:5 MDGD and/or 36:5 DGDG. Formation of grana is not the only membrane process that requires 36:5 GDG, however, because loss of integrity in the internal membranes of bundle sheath chloroplasts, as well as mesophyll plastids, was evident in o5- seedlings. Mesphophyll and bundle sheath chloroplasts in C4 plants such as maize exhibit discrete structural features and carry out different biochemical functions. Bundle sheath chloroplasts lack grana and are specialized for carbon fixation in the stroma by the Calvin cycle (reviewed in Waters and Langdale, 2009). Thus, there appears to be a generalized requirement for 36:5 lipids in thylakoid membrane biogenesis that is not restricted to any particular aspect of photosynthesis.A possible explanation for the function of 36:5 GDG in chloroplasts is that they have a structural organization that differs from that of 36:6 GDG, and lipids with these different properties are necessary for proper thylakoid structure and/or assembly of protein complexes therein. Although most membrane lipids are organized in a bilayer structure, MGDG typically assumes a nonbilayer, reverse hexagonal phase organization (HII) (Cullis and de Kruijff, 1979). Such nonbilayer structures are thought to be particularly suited for tight turns in membranes and/or for packing of membrane around densely populated protein complexes (Simidjiev et al., 2000; Dörmann and Benning, 2002; Hölzl and Dörmann, 2007). Previous research showed that the extent of desaturation affects the propensity of MGDG to adopt the HII structure, such that fewer double bonds favor bilayer formation. Notably, changes from five or more double bonds to less than five can significantly affect the bilayer/HII distribution (Gounaris et al., 1983). Thus, the effects of o5- mutations on 36:5 GDG abundance may have changed the abundance and/or location of bilayer and nonbilayer structures within the thylakoids. This in turn could explain the disorganized membranes, loss of granal stacks, and reduced chlorophyll in o5- leaves.The results of this study provide strong support for the conclusion that a functional connection exists between starch biosynthesis and the structure of internal amyloplast membranes. In contrast with leaves, total GDG content was strongly reduced in endosperm of o5-Ref homozygotes, to ~25% of normal, and all species of MGDG and DGDG were significantly decreased. Two explanations for the quantitatively different effects between leaf and endosperm can be considered. First, MGD2 or MGD3 activity may compensate for loss of MGD1 in leaf, but not in endosperm. This is unlikely, however, because there are no differences in MGD2 or MGD3 mRNA levels between endosperm and leaf in the wild type or o5- mutants and because, as noted previously, o5-Ref gene dosage clearly determines significant components of the leaf lipid profile. A second explanation could again be that the mutant MGD1 protein differentially recognizes DAG substrates based on degree of desaturation. In contrast with the leaf, endosperm contains virtually no 36:6 GDG species, whereas 36:4 GDG is predominant. If MGD1-G430C is less active against 36:5 DAG than 36:6 DAG, as proposed for leaf, it might be even less active using 36:4 DAG as the substrate. This could explain why the decrease in total GDG is much more severe in endosperm than in leaf.Reduced GDG content in endosperm membranes had a clear effect on starch, which is likely the reason for the opaque kernel phenotype. At mid-development, granules were smaller in o5-Ref and o5-PS3038 homozygous endosperm than in the wild type, suggesting a delay in initiation and/or slower growth rate. Irregular growth ring spacing was observed in mutants, which could reflect altered granule growth processes or may be a consequence of distorted granule shape. Compound granules were frequent in mature mutant endosperm. In the null mutant, almost every granule was compound, and in some instances, there appeared to be 10 or more separate initiation events within the compound granules. Distinct initiation events, as opposed to fractured granules, were demonstrated by TEM observation of separate sets of concentric growth rings.Little is known about initiation of starch granules in plants in general and endosperm in particular. One clue comes from observations that granule initiation in maize, oat (Avena sativa), or barley (Hordeum vulgare) endosperm occurs in plastids containing internal thylakoids, possibly within pockets of such membranes (Buttrose, 1960; Badenhuizen, 1969). Based on such ultrastructural data, association with thylakoid-like membranes within amyloplasts has been proposed as a functional aspect of starch polymer synthesis, granule formation, and growth (Salema and Badenhuizen, 1967; Barlow and Sargent, 1978). Direct evidence addressing this hypothesis is lacking; however, this study provides some support by showing a drastic switch in granule complexity when membrane lipids are altered. In normal maize, granules are first observed in endosperm within elongated, irregularly shaped amyloplasts containing multiple starch particles. Granules grow as development proceeds, and during this period, the amyloplasts divide such that each starch particle is surrounded individually by a double membrane (Badenhuizen, 1969; Shannon et al., 2009). The switch to compound granules in endosperm reduced in GDG content could arise from changes in the amyloplast division process such that membranes are unable to completely separate the growing starch particles. In this instance, outer envelope membrane would surround multiple starch grains, separated from each other by internal plastid membrane. Compound granules are the norm in rice endosperm, where internal membrane is thought to form separate compartments within a single amyloplast, each containing an individual starch particle (Yun and Kawagoe, 2010). Growth of the particles results in a compound granule within each plastid, similar to those observed here in o5- mutants.Another interpretation is that abnormal thylakoid membrane structure could affect the temporal or spatial details of granule initiation during the early stages of amyloplast development, so that later separation into individual simple granules does not occur normally. Internal membrane structure may also influence or organize the coordinated activities of starch biosynthetic enzymes. This hypothesis is proposed as an explanation of the alteration in amylopectin fine structure observed to result from decreased GDG content (Figure 8). Amylopectin structure is determined by the combined activities of starch synthases, starch branching enzymes, and starch debranching enzymes (Myers et al., 2000; Ball and Morell, 2003; Zeeman et al., 2007). The functions of one or more of these enzymes could be affected by the structure of amyloplast thylakoids, thus resulting in alterations in granule gross morphology, initiation, growth rate, and/or fine structure. Abnormal assembly of ISA complexes in o5-Ref endosperm is consistent with this hypothesis. The specific connection between GDG content, amyloplast thylakoid structure, and starch biosynthesis currently is not known, although the data of this study indicate clearly that such a connection does exist.The possibility must be considered that lipid composition indirectly affects starch granule formation. For example, o5- mutations may impact the plastid import systems, and disrupted protein or metabolite transport could secondarily cause defects in granule production. This explanation is unlikely, however, because amyloplasts in o5-Ref mutants appear to be fully functional in terms of starch level, and mature kernels are viable without germination defects. Altered protein import into amyloplasts would have global effects on metabolism, including starch biosynthesis, and significant changes in metabolite transfer would have similarly broad effects, including decreased total starch level. Indirect effects of MGD1 deficiency owing to changes in gene expression should also be considered. As with all opaque mutants studied, numerous changes in gene expression at the level of mRNA accumulation were found in o5-Ref endosperm (Hunter et al., 2002). Several genes that could affect starch biosynthesis either directly or indirectly are included in the set of ~90 genes that were observed to have at least a twofold difference in mRNA level. Altered gene expression could result from signals derived from galacto- or phospholipid levels changed as a result of MGD1 deficiency and/or from altered metabolite levels.Plastids are known to be crucial for various developmental processes, and nearly one-third of known Arabidopsis embryo-defective mutants affect plastid genes (Hsu et al., 2010; Inaba and Ito-Inaba, 2010). The phenotypes of o5- plants bear striking parallels to maize etched1 (et1) mutants. Like o5, weak et1 alleles cause virescent seedlings that are initially pale but then become normal dark green (Sangeetha and Reddy, 1991; Scanlon et al., 1994; da Costa e Silva et al., 2004). Strong alleles cause defective endosperm development and embryo arrest, whereas heteroallelic combinations cause albino seedlings that die soon after germination. A striking aspect of et1 endosperm defects is sectors of cells devoid of starch. Like o5, the primary defects of et1 mutants appear to affect plastid function. The et1 locus encodes a zinc ribbon protein that is targeted to plastids and appears to function in transcription (da Costa e Silva et al., 2004). Thus, functionally deficient plastids, impaired through distinct mechanisms, lead to highly similar plant and kernel phenotypes in o5- and et1- mutants.Photosynthesis is thought to be critical for embryo development in many species, particularly dicots where embryos become green for much of seed development (Tschiersch et al., 2011). The physiological benefit of embryo photosynthesis is unclear, but one hypothesis is that the oxygen produced is critical to support respiration and maintain appropriate redox status in the hypoxic cellular environment of developing seeds. The ability to rescue Arabidopsis mgd1-2 null mutant embryos with exogenous Suc would suggest that photosynthetic dysfunction is primarily responsible for the embryo lethality (Kobayashi et al., 2007). However, normal embryo development and seed germination in nonphotosynthetic albino mutants of Arabidopsis and maize (Prikryl et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010) would suggest this explanation is not adequate. Furthermore, impaired photosynthesis seems an implausible explanation for the defects in o5- maize endosperm development. Cereal grains have a single layer of photosynthetic collenchyma cells in the pericarp, but the endosperm does not contain chlorophyll (Tschiersch et al., 2011). As such, on segregating ears, the homozygous o5-PS3038 mutant endosperms are surrounded by photosynthetically competent, genetically heterozygous maternal pericarp tissue, yet display defects. Therefore, a disruption of critical nonphotosynthetic plastid functions must be responsible for the mutant endosperm phenotype in maize.As mentioned, assembly and function of several photosynthetic protein complexes require specific galactolipid interactions (Liu et al., 2004; Sakurai et al., 2006; Hölzl and Dörmann, 2007; Jones, 2007; Loll et al., 2007; Domonkos et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2009). As such, it is likely that membrane composition could also affect plastid membrane protein complexes that function in processes other than photosynthesis. Plastids are centers for many metabolic processes, notably fatty acid biosynthesis (Joyard et al., 2010) and carotenoid biosynthesis (Lopez et al., 2008), which also involve integral membrane protein complexes. Several key hormones, including gibberellins (Yamaguchi, 2008), abscisic acid (Nambara and Marion-Poll, 2005), brassinosteroids (Boutté and Grebe, 2009), and cytokinins (Sakakibara, 2006), derive from plastidic isoprenoid metabolism. Perturbations in this system could readily explain the pleiotropic effects of mgd1 mutations on development as well as the observed carotenoid deficiency. Other integral membrane protein complexes include the plastid protein import machinery (Kessler and Schnell, 2009). Thus, membrane composition could potentially affect multiple critical protein complexes involved in plastid processes that are required for cellular function and plant viability. The disruption of such other functions likely results in embryo lethality of mutants entirely lacking MGD1 such as o5-PS3038.The mutations o5-PS3038, o5-5288, and o5-313328 were isolated independently from self-pollinated ears of active Mutator lines in nontargeted mutagenesis experiments. The mutations were backcrossed into the B73 and/or W64A genetic backgrounds for at least three generations, and o5-Ref was backcrossed into the same inbreds for more than five generations. Nonviable mutations were maintained in the heterozygous state, and such plants were identified as backcross parents by appearance of ~25% opaque kernels on self-pollinated ears. Plants carrying o5-Ref were maintained in the homozygous state after backcrossing.Kernels were collected from self-pollinated o5-Ref/+ or o5-PS3038/+ ears in the B73 genetic background segregating 25% homozygous mutant kernels. Controls were wild-type sibling kernels from the same segregating ears, with genotypes of either o5-/+ or +/+. Kernels from such ears were harvested at 15 or 20 DAP and used immediately for light microscopy analysis of endosperm and embryo tissue. The same tissues were used for comparison of MGD1 transcript levels between wild-type and o5-PS3038/o5-PS3038 mutant kernels. Mature kernels were used for TEM analysis.Developing kernels used for analysis of enzymes, starch structures, transcript abundance, or polar lipid content were harvested from field-grown plants at 20 DAP, immediately frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80° until use. Where indicated, endosperm and embryo tissue was separated by dissection after thawing kernels on ice. Greenhouse-grown seedlings provided leaf, root, and shoot tissue for analysis of transcript levels and leaf tissue for polar lipid quantification.Related sequences were identified in the NCBI protein database by performing a BLASTp search (Camacho et al., 2009). Selected sequences were aligned using ClustalW (Larkin et al., 2007), followed by manual editing, and the output alignment is shown in Supplemental Figure 1 online. Conserved residues in the output alignment file were shaded using the Boxshade program (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). The phylogenetic tree was produced with MEGA4 using default parameters of the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) algorithm, although neighbor joining gave an identical topology (Tamura et al., 2007).

Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen). DNase-treated total RNA (3 μg) was reverse transcribed in a 20-μL reaction with Superscript III (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primers. Genomic DNA contamination was checked by PCR using ubiquitin primers on DNase-treated RNA as a template. The cDNA synthesis reaction (1 μL) was used as template in PCR reactions with gene-specific primers. Ubiquitin primers or ISA2 primers used in control reactions were previously described (Lee et al., 2009; Kubo et al., 2010). Primer sequences for amplification of MGD1 mRNA were as follows: OP5-F, 5′-ATGCCACGAGACTGACCTCT-3′; OP5-R, 5′-TGAGGCTGAT-GGACTACACG-3′; o5-1, 5′-GATGGAAGAATGTATGGGTGCTTG-3′; o5-2, 5′-TGGGCCAAACCAGTCGGCAACT-3′; o5-3, 5′-GGAGTTCGGCGACGACTACCAG-3′; o5-4, 5′-GTGACAAGCTTATGGAACCATGTTGG-3′; o5-5, 5′-GAAGGTGCTGATCCTCATGA-3′; o5-6, 5′-GGAGTAAAACAATATCTACGATGAGTTGC-3′; o5-7, 5′-GACCGAAGGATGAGCTGCGAAGAG-3′. Primers for amplification of MGD2 mRNA were as follows: MGD2-F, 5′-CATTCCACAGCACCTCGCCTA-3′; MGD2-R, 5′-CCACGACATATGGGACGTTC-3′. Primers for amplification of MGD3 mRNA were as follows: MGD3-F, 5′-CCTACTTGTACGCCAACGA-3′; MGD3-R, 5′-CCACGACATATGGGACGTTC-3′.PCR conditions using primers o5-1 to o5-7 were 94°C for 4 min, followed by 31 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 60 s, and a final extension of 72° for 10 min. PCR conditions using primers OP5-F and OP5-R were 95°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 51°C for 30 s, 72°C for 60 s, and a final extension of 72°C for 5 min. Amplification of MGD2 mRNA used the same protocol as for the OP5-F/OP5-R pair except that the annealing temperature was 60°C and 35 cycles were performed. MGD3 mRNA was amplified using the same protocol as for the OP5-F/OP5-R pair except that the annealing temperature was 63°C. In all instances, the number of cycles was less than that necessary to reach a saturating level of signal observed as intensity of DNA bands after staining with ethidium bromide.Lipids were extracted from maize (Zea mays) seedling leaves or developing endosperm following the protocol specified by the Kansas Lipidomics Research Center for Arabidopsis leaf extractions (http://www.k-state.edu/lipid/ lipidomics/leaf-extraction.html). The abundance of specific lipids in the extracts was determined by electrospray ionization-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry according to lipid profiling protocols established by the facility (http://www.k-state.edu/lipid/lipidomics/profiling.htm). These methods detect phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidyl-ethanolamine, MGDG, DGDG, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid. Within each class defined by the head group, mass data specifically identify the total number of carbons and the total number of double bonds present in the two acyl groups combined.Methods for determination of starch quantity in mature and developing endosperm tissue, starch extraction, determination of the linear chain length distribution within amylopectin by fluorescence-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis, and determination of amylose content by Sepharose CL-2B chromatography have been previously described (Kubo et al., 2010 and references therein). Detection of ISA enzyme activities and other starch modifying enzyme activities by zymogram analysis was performed as previously described (Kubo et al., 2010).Specimens for visualization of embryo development were dissected from a self-pollinated o5-PS3038/+ ear at 15 DAP. Kernels were fixed in formalin–acetic acid–alcohol and embedded in paraffin (Berlyn and Miksche, 1976). Microtome sections of 10-μm thickness were affixed to glass microscope slides, deparaffinized in xylene, stained with Safranin O and fast green, and mounted in Permount. Leaf and endosperm specimens for histological analyses were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 3% gluteraldehyde buffered in 0.1 M cacodylate, pH 7.2. For light microscopy analyses of endosperm, samples were embedded in LR White resin and sectioned to 1 μm on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome. Sections were stained with Periodic Acid Schiff’s and methylene blue. For light microscopy analyses of leaf tissue, specimens were embedded in Spurr's resin, sectioned to 1 μm, and stained with toluidine blue. Samples for TEM were also embedded in Spurr's resin and then postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, sectioned to 80 nm, affixed to grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Histological specimens were photographed with an Olympus BX-60 microscope and a Jenoptik C-5 camera system.

PMC3163058,Glycosyltransferase structural biology and its role in the design of catalysts for glycosylation,False,"Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are ubiquitous in nature and are required for the transfer of sugars to a variety of important biomolecules. This essential enzyme family has been a focus of attention from both the perspective of a potential drug target as well as a catalyst for the development of vaccines, biopharmaceuticals and small molecule therapeutics. This review attempts to consolidate the emerging lessons from Leloir (nucleotide-dependent) GT structural biology studies and recent applications of these fundamentals toward rational engineering of glycosylation catalysts.Glycosyltransferases (GTs) mediate the regio- and stereospecific transfer of sugars from various sugar donors to a variety of important biomolecules including glycans, lipids, peptides, and small molecules [1–3]. Understanding GT function, mechanism and structure has contributed to both the development of GT inhibitors as drugs to target pathogens and human disease, as well as the use of GTs to glycodiversify molecules in the search of drug leads [4–7]. Great advances toward understanding GT genomics, catalysis and structure have occurred over the last decade [1,3,7–10]. This review emphasizes the recent advances in Leloir (nucleotide-dependent) GT structural biology and its impact on delineating and engineering GT reaction specificity.Currently, there are over 65,000 GT sequences within the Carbohydrate-Active enZyme database (CAZy, http://www.cazy.org/GlycosylTransferases.html) comprising 89 families based upon sequence similarity [11]. To date, there exist 105 GT structures in the pdb (GT-A: 41, GT-B: 57, GT-C: 2, unclassified: 6), representing 36 of the 89 CAZy GT families, most of which adopt one of two predominate structural folds (GT-A or GT-B). Sometimes described as two closely abutting domains [1], the GT-A fold is a single domain fold composed of a seven stranded β-sheet core flanked by α-helices and a small antiparallel β-sheet (β4` and β7`) bridged via a signature metal-coordinating DXD motif containing loop L4 (Figures 1a and 1c) [12]. The GT-B fold is comprised of two distinct N-terminal and C-terminal Rossmann-like domains of six or seven parallel β-sheet linked to α-helices, connected by a linker region and a interdomain cleft [1] (Figures 1b and 1d). Both the common GT-A or GT-B core can be further amended with additional domains for oligomerization [13] or membrane insertion [14–16]. In some cases, there is domain conservation within a species as exemplified by PSPG domain predominant in plant GTs [17]. Multivariate sequence analysis also predicts the existence of both GT-C and GT-D folds [18] and two recent structures have emerged of putative GT-C members - STT3 oligosaccharyltransferase and PglB [19,20].Representative glycosyltransferase global folds. (a) GT-A fold: human blood group GTA with UDP (Stick model) and Mn2+ ion with DXD signature highlighted (PDB ID: 3IOJ). (b) GT-B fold: OleD, oleandomycin glycosyltransferase with UDP and erythromycin (Stick model) with E/D-Q signature highlighted (PDB ID: 2IYF). (c) Secondary structure topology of GT-A fold. (d) Secondary structure topology of GT-B fold. Variable regions and domains for certain GTs (transmembrane domain for GT-A; tetratricopeptide unit, intervening domain for GT-B) are indicated by shaded regions. Secondary structure elements are color coded as green (helix) and magenta (β-sheet) and the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are labeled ‘N’ and ‘C’, respectively.The binding of metal ion and sugar donor to the GT-A fold is accompanied by local conformational changes of a flexible loop L3, (Figures 1a and 1c) as exemplified by loop rearrangements observed in human GTA and GTB [21,22], followed by additional flexible loop movement (loop L7`) upon the acceptor binding [12,23]. In contrast, GT-B folds often exhibit a global domain movement upon substrate binding, differing in the type and degree of motion in a catalyst-specific manner. This open to closed conformational transition (~10 to 12° shift) [24], typically brings acceptor and donor into close proximity and is also accompanied by several loop movements (N3, N5, and C1) (Figures 1b and 1d). The mycothiol GT MshA, which shows a ~97° rotational reorientation of the N-terminal domain relative to the C-terminal domain [25], stands as a notable GT-B exception in this regard.The GT-A fold sugar donor binding site is consistently found in the central β-sheet region that also contains the DXD signature in L4 (Figures 1a and 1c). In both folds, hydrogen-bonding and π-stacking interactions predominate in base recognition, as recently highlighted in the UDP-Gal-utilizing β-1,4-Gal-T7 (GT-A) [26] and the macrolide GT OleD (GT-B) [24]. While the residue at the end of β1 impacts GT-A nucleotide specificity via hydrogen bonding (Figures 1a and 1c), the conformation and length of the C3 loop (Figures 1b and 1d) stands as a key GT-B determinant for purine versus pyrimidine binding [27,28]. In some cases, π-stacking can be substituted by hydrophobic stacking interactions as recently illustrated in the chondroitin polymerase (GT-A, PDB ID: 2Z86) [29] and phosphatidylinositol mannosyltransferase (GT-B, PDB ID: 2GEJ) [27]. Binding of the core sugar nucleotide diphosphate is enabled by the DXD-coordinated cation (GT-A) or a positive charged residue such as His (OleD [24], VvGT1 [30]), Lys (WsaF [31]) or Arg (PimA [27], PimB [32]) (GT-B). While the residue directly adjacent to the strictly conserved E/D-Q (GT-B loop C5, Figures 1b and 1d) has been implicated to influence GT-B sugar C2-C4 specificity (e.g., Glu352/Gln353 in OleI, Asp330/Gln331 in OleD [24], Asp398/Gln399 in glucuronosyltransferase, 2B7 [15]), the GT-A fold lacks sugar ‘signatures’. In both folds, interactions with the donor sugar are often minimal and dominated by simple steric occlusion. Consistent with this, GTs are often sugar indiscriminant [4,33] and can even transfer non-carbohydrates such as glycerol (TagF) [34].Given the vast structural diversity of acceptors, it is not surprising that the sequences and structures of the acceptor binding regions are divergent. In the GT-A fold, the central β-sheet core of the C-terminus is topologically conserved, but significant variation in C-terminal β-strands (α/β) (GnT-I [35]), α-helices (LgtC [36] and Lgt1 [23]) and/or loops (GTA, GTB [37], β-1,4-Gal-T1 [12] and β-1,4-Gal-T7 [26]) contribute to acceptor specificity and regiospecificity. Rearrangements of the flexible loop L7` (Figures 1a and 1c), induced by metal ion and donor binding, completes the formation of acceptor molecule binding site [12].The N-terminal domain is an important feature in GT-B acceptor binding. Loops N3 and N5 (Figures 1b and 1d), which often undergo a disordered to ordered transition in the presence of ligand, and the neighboring N3 and N5 α-helices form an internal hydrophobic cavity (OleI, OleD [24], GtfD [38]) or solvent exposed pocket (GtfA [39]). In contrast, plant flavone GT (VvGT1 and UGT78G1 [30,40]) and the recent CalG1 and CalG3 structures (Figure 2) reveal a more equal engagement of both domains in acceptor coordination (N3 helices and C1, C5 loops) in a unique ‘bi-domain’ binding event. A comparison of the ‘bi-domain’ calicheamicin binding GTs (CalG1/CalG3) to the N-terminal domain calicheamicin-binding GTs (CalG2/CalG4), reveals the presence or absence of a cavity between the N3 and N5 α-helices as the key determinant for single or bi-domain binding, respectively. In addition to impacting impact acceptor specificity, these distinctions also influence reaction regiospecificity (e.g., the vancomycin GtfA and GtfD [38,39]; the calicheamicin CalG1-G4, Figure 2) and, to a lesser extent, sugar nucleotide specificity (e.g., OleD versus OleI).Structures of the four calicheamicin GTs (CalG1-G4) and the corresponding calicheamicin glycosidic bonds that they form (center). CalG1 (PDB ID: 3OTH, cyan, upper left), G2 (PDB ID: 3IAA, magenta, lower left), G3 (PDB ID: 3OTI, green, upper right), and G4 (PDB ID: 3IA7, orange, lower right). Bound substrates are shown in sphere (TDP: red, CLM: slate) and the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are labeled ‘N’ and ‘C’, respectively. CalG2 utilizes the predominate N-terminal domain binding mode while CalG3 and G1 utilize a more equivalent ‘bi-domain’ binding mode.GT reactions are also classified based upon inversion or retention of anomeric configuration (Figure 3a) but it is important to note that the given GT structural fold does not correlate to reaction stereospecificity. For GT-A-catalyzed inversion, a conserved catalytic Asp or Glu (at the end of α6, Figures 1 a and 1c) mediates the SN2 direct displacement. In the GT-B fold, a conserved Nα1 catalytic residue (Asp [38,39] or His [24,30], Figures 1b and 1d, Figure 3b) located in the interdomain cleft mediates the displacement reaction. The mechanism for retention remains somewhat controversial [1] and support for both a double displacement [41,42] or an SNi-like mechanism [43] exists. From structural studies, the lack of suitably positioned nucleophiles for double displacement in retaining GT-A (Lgt1 [24]) or GT-B folds (WsaF [31], MshA [25], PimA [27], and PimB [32]) also lends indirect support for the SNi-like mechanism. The residues on the β-face of donor molecule binding site have been implicated in substrate recognition, orientation, and reaction stereospecificity in both retaining GT-A and GT-B folds, but general structural signatures are lacking [1].(a) GT reaction mechanisms that lead to the ultimate inversion or retention of the anomeric stereocenter upon glycosyltransfer. (b) Comparison of the active sites of a representative GT-B O-GT, N-GT, and C-GT. Substrates and catalytic residues are illustrated as sticks. (CalG3, O-GT, PDB ID: 3OTI; UGT72B1, a bifunctional O/N-GT, PDB ID: 2VCE; UrdGT2, C-GT, PDB ID: 2P6P).GTs glycosylate a variety of acceptor nucleophiles including oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and carbon and, with the exception of perhaps those involved in C-glycosylation, most GTs contain the fundamental machinery for heteroatom (O-, N-, and S-) glycosylation (Figure 3b). In most, if not all, cases where a perceived nucleophile specificity has been reported, the reactivity of the nucleophile (not that of the GT catalytic machinery or structural fold) is the predominant factor influencing observed differences in substrate turnover. Consistent with this, O-, N-, and S-glycosylation by GT-B folds (e.g. OleD [4,44] and Arabidopsis thaliana UGT72B1 [45]) has been reported. The exception, C-glycosylation (exemplified by the urdamycin UrdGT2 [46]), catalyzes nucleophilic aromatic substitution which is aided by an acceptor’s ortho and/or para directing hydroxyl groups [47,48]. Based upon the structure, UrdGT2 Asp137 has been implicated in deprotonation of the ortho-directing C9 acceptor hydroxyl as the activating step in C-glycosylation (Figure 3b). Recently, two Cys-specific S-glycosyltransferases have been reported (SunS [49] and GccA [50]) and, based upon sequence analysis, these S-GTs may adopt novel folds.Sequence- or structure-guided GT engineering includes positional mutagenesis and the construction of chimeric GTs. Success in the latter case, which includes plant flavonoid, and bacterial aminoglycoside, glycopeptide, and angucycline GTs [45,51–56], typically requires a very high degree of sequence/structural homology between the GTs to be combined. This section focuses upon the engineering fundamentals of donor, aglycon and nucleophile specificity as well as the impact of GT proficiency upon engineering ‘new’ activities in the context of both the GT-A and GT-B fold. A summary of the representative GT engineering examples highlighted within this section is also provided in Table I.A summary of the representative GT-engineering studies highlighted.Given the lack of global sugar ‘signatures’, few, if any, general rules exist for engineering sugar donor specificity of either the GT-A or GT-B fold and notably, the modifications that have achieved altered donor specificity are not exclusively found within the donor-binding site. Among recent GT-A examples (Figure 4a), a Y289L mutation of galactosyltransferase (β-1,4-GalT1) enabled the transfer of both GalNAc and Gal at comparable rates and mutation of R228K of β-1,4-GalT1 showed 15-fold improved glucosyltransferase (GlcT) activity at the expense of GalT activity [12]. Studies with a β-1,3-glucuronosyltransferase (β-1,3-GlcAT) created a mutant, H308R, with broadened donor specificity toward Glc, Man and GlcNAc [57]. Among recent GT-B examples, a single R140W mutation changed the glucuronosyltransferase (GlcAT) VvGT5 to a bifunctional GlcT/GalT [58] and replacement of Gln373 with histidine of the bifunctional GlcT/GalT VvGT6 resulted in loss of VvGT6 activity toward UDP-Glc without substantial loss of GalT activity. This study also identified Gln373 and Pro19 to play important roles in the bifunctional specificity of the enzyme [58,59] (Figure 4b).Representative examples of engineering donor and acceptor specificities, iterative function and proficiency with residues invoking desired changes upon mutation highlighted. (a) GT-A donor specificity, β-1,4-GalT1, PDB ID: 1FR8. (b) GT-B donor and acceptor specificity, OleD, PDB ID: 2IYF. Highlighted residues are structurally equivalent to those in other GT-B fold GTs (OleD residues G19, V136, L170, P186, A242 and Q331 correspond to P19 of VvGT6, F148 of UGT71G1, V200 of UGT85H2, Y202 of UGT71G1, I305 of UGT85H2 and Q373 of VvGT6, respectively). (c) GT-B iterative function, OleD, PDB ID: 2IYF. Residues highlighted represent the structurally equivalent region/residues identified to be important for iterative function by domain swapping experiments between LanGT1 and LndGT1. (d) GT-B proficiency and expanded donor/acceptor promiscuity, OleD, PDB ID: 2IYF. The residues highlighted indicate amino acid residues identified to alter function via directed evolution. For panels b-d, the GT-B fold N-terminal and C-terminal domains are labeled ‘N’ and ‘C’, respectively.Given the divergent natural of acceptors and acceptor binding, general rules are also lacking for engineering acceptor specificity of either the GT-A or GT-B fold and again, the modifications that have achieved altered acceptor specificity are not exclusively found within the acceptor-binding site. Studies to alter acceptor specificity of the GT-A fold are lacking, possibly limited due to the requirement of donor binding for the formation of the acceptor binding site. Among recent GT-B examples, structure-guided mutagenesis of the legume flavonoid GT, UGT71G1, identified two mutations (F148V and Y202A, Figure 4b) which drastically changed the regioselectivity of quercetin glycosylation [60]. In another GT-B example, domain swapping studies between the landomycin LndGT1 and LanGT1 (Figure 4c), revealed that the iterative function of LanGT1 is controlled by up to 20 amino acids dispersed throughout the catalyst [54]. Similarly, studies of chimeric GTs identified amino acid region 125–239 of plant GT, UGT71E1 as crucial for the regiospecificity of trans-resveratrol glycosylation [53].Engineering aglycon nucleophile specificity has also been accomplished in the GT-B fold. Toward this goal, Brazier-Hicks et. al performed domain shuffling between two plant flavonoid GTs (UGT72B1, a bifunctional, N/O-GT, and BnUGT, an O-GT) and found that only chimeras containing residues 259–370 from UGT72B1 could support N-glucosylation. Mutation at just two positions, D312N/F315Y in BnUGT were ultimately sufficient for N-GT, while the reciprocal mutations in UGT72B1 (N312D-Y315F) decreased the N-GT function of UGT72B1 [45].Engineering either acceptor or donor binding sites can also improve rates and/or catalytic efficiency. Representative examples include mannosylglycerate synthase (GT-A fold, donor site mutation, 72-fold increase in kcat) [61], Medicago truncatula UGT85H2 (GT-B fold, donor or acceptor site mutations, up to 54-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency, Figure 4b) [62] and macrolide GT OleD (GT-B fold, donor and acceptor site mutations, up to 60-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency) [33]. Importantly, these increases in GT proficiency also often correlate to increases in GT promiscuity. Perhaps the best illustration of this phenomenon derives from the directed evolution of OleD (Figure 4d) which led to a series of more proficient variants capable of: i) utilizing 12 ‘new’ sugar donors, ii) utilizing >50 ‘new’ acceptors (most of which are drugs or drug-like molecules), iii) the glycosylation of a wide range of nucleophiles (including alcohols, amines, thiols, oximes, hydrazines, hydrazides, N-hydroxyamides, O-substituted oxyamines, and carboxylic acids), and iv) iterative glycosylation (to enable the formation of di- and trisaccharides) [4,33,63]. Thus, as GT engineering and evolution efforts continue to advance at a rapid pace, it will be important for those in the field to carefully distinguish true specificity changes from ‘new’ activities simply deriving from such global overall proficiency improvements.The unpublished work presented was supported by NIH (AI52218, CA84374 and {""type"":""entrez-nucleotide"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GM074901"",""term_id"":""222014654"",""term_text"":""GM074901""}}GM074901) and the Laura and Edward Kremers Chair in Natural Products Chemistry (J.S.T.).

PMC3272405,"Distantly-related plant and nematode core α1,3-fucosyltransferases display similar trends in structure-function relationships",False,"Here we present a comparative structure-function study of a nematode and a plant core α1,3-fucosyltransferase, based on deletion and point mutations of the coding regions of Caenorhabditis elegans FUT-1 and Arabidopsis thaliana FucTA (FUT11). In particular our results reveal a novel ‘first cluster motif’ shared by both core and Lewis-type α1,3-fucosyltransferases of the GT10 family. To evaluate the role of the conserved serine within this motif, this residue was replaced with alanine in FucTA (S218) and FUT-1 (S243). The S218A replacement completely abolished the enzyme activity of FucTA, while the S243A mutant of FUT-1 retained 20% of the ‘wild-type’ activity. Based on the results of homology modelling of FucTA, other residues potentially involved in the donor substrate binding were examined and mutations of N219 and R226 dramatically affected enzymatic activity. Finally, as both FucTA and FUT-1 were shown to be N-glycosylated, we examined the putative N-glycosylation sites. While alanine replacements at single potential N-glycosylation sites of FucTA resulted in loss of up to 80% of the activity, a triple glycosylation site mutant still retained 5%, as compared to the control. In summary, our data indicate similar trends in structure-function relationships of distantly-related enzymes which perform similar biochemical reactions and form the basis for future work aimed at understanding the structure of α1,3-fucosyltransferases in general.Fucosyltransferases are in general divided into two superfamilies according to their sequence similarities and type of linkage formed. The members of the first superfamily are α1,2-, α1,6- and protein-O-fucosyltransferases which belong to the GT11, GT37, GT23, GT65 and GT68 families according to the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database (http://www.cazy.org/; Cantarel et al. 2009). All α1,3- and α1,4-fucosyltransferases belong to the second superfamily, whether core α1,3 or Lewis-type; they are defined as being members of the GT10 family. In contrast to Lewis-type enzymes which modify glycan antennae, core α1,3-fucosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1.214) catalyse addition of L-fucose from GDP-Fuc to the reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of N-glycans; thereby, these enzymes form the core α1,3-fucose epitope which is a conserved feature of plants and invertebrates (Paschinger et al. 2009). As mammals lack this type of fucosylation, this epitope is recognised by mammalian immune systems as a foreign element; indeed, core α1,3-fucose is an epitope for IgE from the sera of many patients with insect, pollen or food allergy and for IgG directed against immunised plant and insect glycoproteins (Wilson et al. 1998; Hemmer et al. 2001).During the last two decades several studies dealt with bioinformatic analysis of protein sequences of enzymes belonging to the GT10 family. The story started with the discovery of the so-called α1,3-FucT motif (Martin et al. 1997) which was also described by Breton and colleagues as motif II, in addition to another motif called I (Breton at al. 1998; see also Figure 1). These motifs were observed during the analysis of the sequences of the human Lewis-type FucT III-VII and FucT-IX by Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA). Later a third conserved peptide motif (I/V/F)HH(R/W)(D/E)(I/V/L) was revealed and called the acceptor motif, because replacement of a single residue Trp111 to Arg within this motif of FucT-III led to the formation of the Lex epitope (α1,3-fucosylation, which requires β1,4 bound galactose to the GlcNAc) instead of the Lea epitope (α1,4-fucosylation, which requires β1,3 bound galactose to the GlcNAc) (Dupuy et al. 1999, Dupuy et al. 2002). A fourth conserved motif, located toward the N-terminus, prior to the acceptor motif, was later called motif III (Dupuy et al. 2002, Dupuy et al. 2004). Dupuy and colleagues claimed that motif III may correspond to the beginning of the catalytic domain of vertebrate α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases (Dupuy et al. 2002). As the result of a recent study in which a fifth conserved motif was found (Mollicone et al. 2009), the five motifs were renamed according to their order in the protein sequence (Figure 1A).A.

Conserved residues are represented by white letters on a black background; other significant homologies are indicated with white letters on a grey background.Recently the 3D structure of a highly C-terminally truncated form of a prokaryotic Lewis-type α1,3-fucosyltransferase (FucT) from Helicobacter pylori, a member of the GT10 family, was solved by X-ray crystallography. FucT crystals soaked with GDP-Fucose revealed the donor substrate binding site (Sun et al. 2007). It is evident from the structure that the C-terminal portion of the catalytic domain is responsible for the donor substrate binding while, as predicted for other GT10 members, the N-terminal subdomain interacts with the acceptor substrate. FucT and FucU (another Lewis-type α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologue) from Helicobacter pylori J99 share some conserved features with other GT10 members such as the α1,3-FucT motif. The main difference is that, unlike the eukaryotic GT10 members, they are not type II transmembrane proteins. Furthermore, they have a repetitive sequence on their C-terminus which is responsible for their dimerisation and membrane anchoring (Sun et al. 2007).Eukaryotic GT10 members, as type II transmembrane proteins, have a topology typical of Golgi glycosyltransferases with a so-called cytoplasmic/transmembrane/stem or CTS region followed by a globular C-terminal catalytic domain (Grabenhorst and Conradt 1999). In addition, plant core α1,3-fucosyltransferases are extended by a C-terminal region of approximately 100 residues as compared to other GT10 members. This C-terminal tail does not show similarity to any other known sequence. Core α1,3-fucosyltransferases from the invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster do not possess such a region, even though they catalyse the same or similar reaction (Fabini et al. 2001; Paschinger et al. 2004). Furthermore, consistent with their localisation within the secretory pathway, plant and invertebrate core α1,3-fucosyltransferases possess potential N-glycosylation sites, as do other eukaryotic GT10 members. It is interesting to note that GT10 members, as well as some other glycosyltransferases with this proposed topology, are sensitive to deletions at the C-terminus, while most N-terminal CTS regions are not essential for the enzymatic activity (Xu et al. 1996; Sherwood and Holmes, 1999).In the past, the structure-function relationships of especially human Lewis-type fucosyltransferases were examined; here, however, we focus on two core α1,3-fucosyltransferases from different organisms, which have subtly divergent substrate specificities (see Scheme I). Whereas the nematode enzyme (C. elegans FUT-1) accepts paucimannosidic glycans lacking non-reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues, the plant enzyme (A. thaliana FucTA) requires at least one such residue on its acceptors. Previously, both enzymes were expressed in P. pastoris as recombinant soluble forms lacking the putative cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (Wilson et al. 2001; Paschinger et al. 2004). In order to assess minimal active variants of both enzymes, the importance for catalytic activity of selected conserved residues and the role of predicted N-glycosylation sites, we extended the previous studies by preparing a series of truncation and site-directed mutants. Furthermore, our data allow us to define for the first time a putative donor binding motif also present in Lewis-type fucosyltransferases.Both possible in vivo and in vitro reactions of C. elegans and A. thaliana core α1,3-fucosyltransferases are shown; the C. elegans FUT-1 catalyses the transfer of fucose to MMF6 in vivo, but the transfer to Man5 has also been observed (see this study). On the other hand, the A. thaliana FucTA probably accepts xylosylated and non-xylosylated forms of MGn or GnGn in vivo, but can transfer to α1,6-fucosylated glycans in vitro, even though these glycans are not naturally present in plants (hence ‘reaction possible in vitro’ as opposed to ‘possible reaction in vivo’). N-glycans abbreviations are based on the complex N-glycan nomenclature of Schachter (Fabini et al. 2001) and the schematic representations for N-acetylglucosamine, fucose and mannose are those proposed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics.As previously shown, employment of the yeast α-mating factor signal sequence at the N-terminus of the untagged truncated FucTA mutant Δ1-88 (which lacks the CTS domain) resulted in secretion of the fusion protein into the P. pastoris conditioned medium (Bencúrová et al. 2003), whereas the Δ1-95 form was apparently inactive. By recloning a reading frame encoding residues 89-501 of FucTA into a redesigned version of the pPICZαC vector, a new recombinant form of FucTA with both His- and FLAG-tags at its mature N-terminus was prepared. Successful expression in P. pastoris was shown by activity tests and Western blotting with anti-FLAG; the enzyme could also be purified by nickel chelation chromatography using either Ni-NTA or HisTrap columns. The calculated Mr of this form of FucTA is approximately 49 kDa, whereas Western blotting indicates a Mr of 60-70 kDa (Figures 2A, lane REF and ​and2C,2C, lane a); the difference is probably due to glycosylation as shown by its sensitivity to PNGase F (Figure 2C, lanes a and b). Further experiments regarding truncation, putative catalytically-important residues and predicted N-glycosylation sites of FucTA were prepared using this HisFLAG-tagged form.A:
A. thaliana FucTA mutants produced in P. pastoris were analysed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (REF, ‘wild-type’ HisFLAG-tagged δ1-88; Triple, triple mutant T339A_T422A_S483A; δδ, double truncation mutant δδ1-88;388-501). Amounts of applied purified protein were normalised on the basis of Anti-FLAG ELISA.B: The relative specific enzymatic activities of truncated and single point mutated FucTA constructs. Activity of the REF (HisFLAG-tagged δ1-88) was normalised to 100% as a reference value (100 % activity corresponds to approximately 1 nmol/h/μg). Enzyme activities were evaluated by reverse phase HPLC-assisted measurement of the conversion of GnGnF6-NST-dansyl (see Scheme 1). Relative protein expression levels were estimated by Anti-FLAG ELISA.C: PNGase F treatment of FucTA and FUT-1. The reference (REF) δ1-88 form of FucTA was purified by HisTrap affinity chromatography, treated by PNGase F and analyzed by SDS PAGE (line a: purified FucTA; b: PNGase F treated FucTA). The δ1-78 form of FUT-1 was also subject to PNGase F treatment (line c: purified FUT-1; d: PNGase F treated FUT-1).D:
C. elegans FUT-1 mutants produced in P. pastoris were analysed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (δδ, δδ1-78;424-433).E: The relative specific activities of truncated and single point mutated FUT-1 constructs. Activity of the δ1-78 was used as 100% reference, which corresponds to approximately 1 nmol/h/μg. Enzyme activities were evaluated by reverse phase HPLC-assisted measurement of the conversion of MMF6-NS-dansyl (δδ, δδ1-78;424-433).An initial experiment was aimed at defining whether the last 113 residues, delineating the C-terminal subdomain unique to plant core α1,3-fucosyltransferases, are necessary for the enzyme activity. Deletion of the C-terminal subdomain of the Δ1-88 form resulted in expression of a double truncated mutant of FucTA (ΔΔ1-88;388-501: Figure 2A lane ΔΔ). Based on use of anti-FLAG ELISA to determine the relative expression levels, we observed that this deletion results in a dramatic decrease of the specific activity of the purified protein, which retains a mere 1% of the original activity of Δ1-88 (Figure 2B). Considering also the aforementioned previous results, the minimum catalytically active region of FucTA commences between residues 89 and 94, whereas the extended C-terminal region is still important for activity or stability.In addition to analysing a FLAG-tagged form of FUT-1 lacking the N-terminal 32 residues, a set of mutants of this enzyme, engineered to lack either N-terminal and/or C-terminal residues, were expressed in P. pastoris. Truncations were engineered based on the protein sequence homology of the five different α1,3-fucosyltransferases previously cloned from C. elegans (Paschinger et al. 2004) in order to estimate the boundary between the CTS and the catalytic domain. It was attempted to generate the following mutants possessing N-terminal FLAG-tags: Δ1-78, ΔΔ1-78;424-433, Δ1-95, ΔΔ1-95;424-433. However, only two of the truncated mutants Δ1-78 and ΔΔ1-78;424-433 were successfully expressed in P. pastoris and further characterised (Figures 2D and 2E).As the C-terminal region of some fucosyltransferases is essential for catalytic activity (Xu Z et al. 1996; Tanaka et al. 2001), the impact of C-terminal truncation on the catalytic activity of FUT-1 was also studied. In accordance with expectations, deletion of 10 amino acids from the C-terminus, to yield the double truncated mutant ΔΔ1-78;424-433, resulted in an almost complete loss of activity (0.2 % of the specific activity of the control Δ1-78) as well as reduced protein expression (Figures 2D and 2E). Considering all our data, it appears that residues 79-433 approximately delineate the minimal region of FUT-1 that can be expressed efficiently in an active form. Therefore, point mutations in the fut-1 open reading frame were prepared based on the truncated form Δ1-78. Two of these mutants (N194Q and T361A) affect two putative N-glycosylation sites; a proof that FUT-1 is indeed glycosylated is offered by the effect of PNGase F digestion on this enzyme (Figure 2C, lanes c and d), a result also observed when examining FUT-1 expressed in insect cells (data not shown).For an exact enzymological characterisation of recombinant FucTA (Δ1-88), a dansylated NST-GnGnF6 glycopeptide was used as a substrate in an RP-HPLC-based assay; the product eluting at 9 minutes was verified by MALDI-TOF MS/MS to have a composition consistent with a GnGnF3F6 structure, whereas this peak was absent in the control (Figure 3A). Recombinant FUT-1 (Δ1-33) also catalyses the synthesis of anti-HRP epitope in vitro, but converts MM and MMF6 glycopeptides to MMF3 and MMF3F6 respectively; therefore, it uniquely accepts paucimannosidic, rather than complex, N-glycans as substrates (Paschinger et al. 2004). Considering data suggesting that C. elegans mutants with increased levels of Man5GlcNAc2 also possess anti-HRP epitopes (specifically, the GlcNAcT-I triple mutant; Zhu et al. 2004), we reappraised whether dansylated NS-Man5 glycopeptide is a FUT-1 substrate; previously, we stated that we had not detected activity (Paschinger et al. 2004). However, when using more enzyme and longer incubation times, we could observe that Man5 was indeed fucosylated as suggested by the appearance of a peak of earlier retention time (9.5 min); the rate of transfer was around an order of magnitude less than that to MMF6. The actual transfer of fucose to the reducing-terminal GlcNAc of Man5 was demonstrated by MS/MS (Figure 3B).A:
Arabidopsis FucTA was characterised using an RP-HPLC-based assay; the dansyl-GnGnF6 substrate was converted to a product displaying an earlier elution time consistent with formation of GnGnF3F6. This product was collected and analysed by MALDI-TOF MS/MS. The loss of m/z 794.1 from the m/z 2183.1 parent ion is consistent with a concomitant loss of both, one terminal GlcNAc residue and the dansylated Asn-Ser-Thr peptide moiety (see putative fragmentation pattern); the two fucose residues are apparently linked to the same reducing-terminal GlcNAc residue as shown by consecutive fragments of m/z 1096.0, 1242.0 and 1389.0. The differences in m/z are annotated with F, H or N, indicating either a difference corresponding to a fucose (strictly, a deoxyhexose), hexose or N-acetylhexosamine residue.B: Caenorhabditis FUT-1 was characterised also in an RP-HPLC-based assay and the transfer of fucose was accompanied by a reduction in retention time as shown by the appearance of a new peak at 9.5 min in the chromatogram after incubating a dansylated Man5 glycopeptide in the presence of the enzyme, GDP-Fuc and Mg(II) ions. The product, absent when Cu(II) was included in the incubation, was analysed by LC-MS/MS with the doubly-charged species of m/z 909.0 being fragmented; the daughter ion with m/z 802.4 is consistent with the attachment of fucose to the asparagine-linked GlcNAc residue (see putative fragmentation pattern).C: Enzyme activity of FucTA (δ1-88) and FUT-1 (δ1-33) in the presence of divalent metal ions. FucTA was purified by HisTrap affinity chromatography and incubated with dansyl-NST-GnGnF6 as substrate, whereas Affigel Blue-purified FUT-1 was tested with dansyl-NS-MMF6; GDP-Fuc was used as the donor substrate either in the presence or absence of different divalent metal ions or EDTA. For both enzymes the highest enzyme activity was referred to be 100%.Using the HPLC-based assay, the optimal pH reaction for Arabidopsis FucTA (Δ1-88) was found to be between pH 6 and 7. Maximal activity at the optimal temperature (30°C) was obtained at pH 6.5 (data not shown). Similarly, the optimal pH for Caenorhabditis FUT-1 (Δ1-33) was previously found to be between pH 6.5 and 8, with a maximal activity at pH 7.5 and a temperature optimum of between 25°C and 30°C (Paschinger et al. 2004); these data were also confirmed when directly comparing FUT-1 activity in culture supernatants of yeast expressing the Δ1-33 and Δ1-78 forms (data not shown)The divalent metal ion dependency of FucTA (Δ1-88) was examined with an enzyme preparation (HisTrap purified) deprived of divalent metal ions by exhaustive dialysis against a dilute Tris buffer; activity assays were then performed in the absence and presence of 10 mM divalent metal ions. The highest relative enzyme activity was obtained in the presence of Mn(II) ions; the enzyme was also active in the presence of Mg(II), Co(II), Ni(II) and Ca(II) and exhibited ~5% activity even in the presence of 10 mM EDTA or in the absence of divalent metal ions. Zn(II) and Cu(II) ions did not activate the enzyme; on the contrary they had an inhibitory effect with activities in the range of 3% as compared to that in the presence of Mn(II) ions (Figure 3C).In the case of FUT-1, the divalent metal ion dependency was examined with an Affigel Blue purified preparation of the Δ1-33 form. Similar to previous results on either C. elegans extracts or crude Pichia supernatants (Paschinger et al. 2004), the highest activity when using MMF6 as a substrate was obtained in the presence of Mg(II) ions. Whereas Zn(II) and Cu(II) ions completely inhibited the enzyme activity, the enzyme still showed activity in the presence of EDTA or without exogenous divalent metal ions (Figure 3C). When Man5 was used as a substrate (data not shown), the level of activation by Mn(II) was consistently some 25% higher as compared to that in the presence of Mg(II).The Km values of FucTA (Δ1-88) and FUT-1 (Δ1-33) for the donor substrate were determined with a series of assays in the presence of decreasing concentration (1 mM – 0.06 mM for FucTA and 2 mM – 0.02 mM for FUT-1) of GDP-Fuc, using dansylated GnGnF6 or MMF6 as the respective acceptors. Using Hanes-Woolf plots (data not shown), the Km values for GDP-Fuc were estimated to be 0.1 mM for both enzymes; therefore, the concentration of donor substrate used in our other experiments was in excess of the Km value. Regarding the acceptor substrate, the Km of FucTA towards NST-GnGnF6 is estimated to be 15 μM; in the case of FUT-1, the Km with NS-Man5 was in the determined to be approximately 400 μM, consistent with this being a relatively poor acceptor substrate.In a comprehensive survey, we analysed protein sequences of 47 members of the GT10 family by Clustal W and Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (Gaboriaud et al. 1987) and found the following peptide region significantly similar for all examined sequences: S-(N/H/D)-X5-9-R-X6-(L/I)-X5-7-(V/L/I)-X3-G (Figure 1B; see also supplementary figure 1). This motif, designated here as the ‘first cluster motif’, is located at a variable distance of between 20 and 30 residues N-terminal to the ‘classical’ α1,3-FucT motif previously defined by Martin at al. (1997). The first cluster motif, which is in addition to the five conserved motifs defined by Mollicone et al. (2009), spans residues 218-244 of the FucTA and 243-269 of the FUT-1 protein (Figures 1 and ​and4);4); it comprises three completely conserved residues (Ser, Arg, Gly) and was confirmed to be present in all GT10 family members from H. sapiens, A. thaliana and C. elegans (supplementary figure 2) regardless of whether they are core or Lewis-type enzymes. Using the crystal structure of H. pylori FucT (Sun et al. 2007) as a template, possible binding modes of the donor substrate GDP-Fuc with the first cluster motif were retrieved demonstrating the formation of hydrogen bonds between the conserved serine and arginine of this motif and the donor substrate (Figure 5).Positions of the conserved motifs within the A. thaliana FucTA and C. elegans FUT-1 sequences are delineated (A. thaliana 1st cluster motif: 218-244 and α1,3 FucT motif: 263-281; C. elegans 1st cluster motif: 243-269 and α1,3 FucT motif: 290-309) in comparison to human GT10 fucosyltransferases.

The putative enzyme catalytic regions are drawn as white bars (proposed beginning for A. thaliana at residue 91 and C. elegans at residue 80; for human fucosyltransferases, the catalytic domain commences with motif I as defined by Mollicone et al (2009)). Plant core α1,3-fucosyltransferases exhibit an extra C-terminal region, which shows neither sequence similarity nor functionality to any other known sequence (proposed C-terminal tail of A. thaliana: 389-501). The short dark grey wave represents the C-terminal tails of human FUT10 (UniProt code: {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q8IVI6"",""term_id"":""74750667"",""term_text"":""Q8IVI6""}}Q8IVI6) and FUT11 (UniProt code: {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""Q8IYE4"",""term_id"":""74750759"",""term_text"":""Q8IYE4""}}Q8IYE4). The conserved CXXC motif in eukaryotic members of the GT10 family (A. thaliana: 364-389 and C. elegans: 393-433) is also indicated.A: One view of the conserved residues of the first cluster motif of Helicobacter pylori FucT in interaction with GDP-Fuc.B: GDP-Fuc accommodated in the enzyme donor substrate binding pocket (coloured part of the protein surface represents conserved residues of the first cluster motif). The Protein Data Bank data of Helicobacter pylori FucT soaked with GDP-Fucose (PDB code: 2NZY) were used as source and visualised by Chimera (Sanner et al. 1996; Pettersen et al. 2004; Goddard et al. 2005).C: View of residues either of the first cluster motif or the loop connecting the 1st cluster and α1,3 FucT motifs (the latter also known as motif V) which may interact with the donor substrate via their side chains based on our model of FucTA's donor binding pocket (the regions around residues S128, N219, R226, Y243 and S253 are shown).As part of our modelling approach, a good protein alignment of H. pylori FucT and A. thaliana FucTA was needed to model the donor binding pocket of the latter. All of the important amino acid residues, which form hydrogen bonds with the donor substrate in the template are present in the model and are almost in the same positions as in the crystal structure. Moreover, in our model one can see how an additional hydrogen bond is formed between the hydroxyl group of S253 and the oxygen of the guanine moiety of the donor substrate as well as a π-π interaction between the lone pair of the guanine’s N7 and the aromatic π system of Y243 (Figure 5).In order to evaluate the role of the conserved serine within the first cluster motif, which may form a hydrogen bond with the oxygen from the α phosphate of GDP-Fuc, alanine mutants of FucTA (S218A) and FUT-1 (S243A) were prepared. Upon expression in P. pastoris, it was observed that the Ser→Ala mutation of FucTA completely abolished enzyme activity, while such a mutation of FUT-1 decreased activity by about 81% (Figures 2B and 2E). Since site-directed mutagenesis was predicted computationally not to affect the local protein structure [Jpred 3 secondary structure prediction server (Cole C et al. 2008)], we propose that this residue plays a significant role in donor substrate binding.Furthermore, alanine mutation of residue R226 was performed. This residue, which is conserved among all catalytically active α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases, forms a hydrogen bond with the β phosphate of the GDP ligand. This mutation led to a complete loss of activity (Figure 2B), whereas alanine replacement of N219, which forms a hydrogen bond with the β phosphate of the GDP ligand in our model, led to a residual activity of approximately 1% (Figure 2B). Mutation of residue Y243, which may be involved in the aforementioned π-π interaction with the N7 atom of the donor, decreased the enzyme activity by approximately 90% (Figure 2B).In the region lying between the two conserved motifs, which seems to be a loop, alanine replacement of residue S253, which might form a hydrogen bond with the guanine of the donor substrate (Figure 5), was also performed. This mutant retained around 35% of activity (Figure 2B). Km values for GDP-Fuc of those first cluster mutants (N219A, Y243A and S253A) which retained some activity were respectively estimated to be 0.33 mM, 0.24 mM and 0.1 mM, as compared to 0.1 mM for the ‘wild-type’ enzyme.As mentioned above, the α1,3-FucT motif (Martin et al. 1997) is found in α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases from different species in different degrees of conservation and has been defined as motif V by Mollicone et al (2009). It is a 19 residue region, of which 10 residues are conserved in all members of the GT10 family (Oriol et al. 1999; Jost et al. 2005). Some of these residues are directly involved in the donor substrate binding as their functional groups form hydrogen bonds with GDP-Fuc. In the case of Helicobacter pylori FucT, the residues Y246, E249 and K250 form hydrogen bonds with GDP-Fuc (Sun et al. 2007).In this context, it is interesting to consider the three α1,3-fucosyltransferase homologues (FucTA, -B, -C) from the honeybee (Apis mellifera), which were cloned and expressed in P. pastoris by Rendić et al. (2007). Despite various attempts, no activity for FucTB was detected. FucTB shows high similarity to the other FucTs, but here glutamate is in the position that is normally occupied by aspartate in eukaryotic fucosyltransferases, including the FucTA and FucTC from the honeybee. To test whether a single change of Asp→Glu could lead to a loss of activity in a distantly related enzyme, a point mutation of C. elegans FUT-1 was prepared, in which D303 was switched to glutamate; this form was expressed in Pichia and possessed 20% of the activity of the wild-type form (Figure 2E). This result indicates sensitivity to changes within the α1,3-FucT motif, but the significant level of residual activity suggests that this sequence deviation may not be the only reason for an absolute lack of detectable activity of honeybee FucTB. Interestingly, in H. pylori FucT this position is occupied by glycine (Figure 1B).The Δ1-88 FucTA mutant contains three putative N-glycosylation sites at N337, N420 and N481 and, when expressed in P. pastoris, it appears as a major band of 70 kDa, whose size is reduced upon digestion with PNGase F (Figure 2C). Analysis of N-glycans, released from the reference enzyme by PNGase F, was also performed and indicates a series of oligomannosidic structures with compositions ranging from Hex5-14HexNAc2 (Figure 6A); such structures are in keeping with previous data on Pichia glycans (Montesino et al. 1999). Thereafter, the three potential N-glycosylation sites of FucTA were examined by alanine screening of the N-X-T/S sites of His FLAG-tagged FucTA. Four FucTA mutant forms (N337A, T339A, T422A and S483A) were expressed in P. pastoris, purified and assayed for activity. N337 is the one glycosylation site conserved in probably all plant core α1,3- fucosyltransferases, including that from the moss Physcomitrella patens.A: N-glycans released from HisFLAG-tagged δ1-88; the m/z values [M+Na]+ are annotated with abbreviated glycan compositions of the form HnN2 (putatively Man5-14GlcNAc2).B: Selected regions of spectra obtained after tryptic digestion of either the HisFLAG-tagged δ1-88 upper and lower bands or PNGase F treated HisFLAG-tagged δ1-88.The relative activities for the N337A, T339A, T422A and S483A mutants, as compared to the reference ‘wild-type’ (Δ1-88) form, were respectively 18.6% (± 0.8%), 12.1% (± 1.5%), 36.5% (± 2.5%) and 32.2% (± 1.3%) (Figure 2B). Thereby, abolishing of the potential for glycosylation at the conserved N337 residue showed the greatest reduction in activity; as compared to the wild-type Km of 0.1 mM, the T339A mutant displayed a Km value for GDP-Fuc of 0.36 mM. Moreover, the active triple N-glycosylation site mutant (Δ1-88 FucTA T339A_T422A_S483A) gives a single well defined band of ~50 kDa, which corresponds to the predicted size of the unglycosylated protein (Figure 2A). The relative specific activity of this mutant is 5.5% (± 0.5%); as compared to the reference enzyme. In the case of the nematode FUT-1, mutagenesis affecting two glycosylation sites (N194 and N359) was also performed; whereas the T361A mutant affecting the latter site was expressed at normal levels and displayed activity, the N194Q mutant was only detected at a low level in supernatants of recombinant yeast (Figure 2E). Perhaps it is significant that N194 is the site conserved in all C. elegans GT10 family members.In order to investigate the glycosylation of the recombinant FucTA mutants in more detail, mass spectrometric tryptic peptide mapping was employed. We analysed the major approximately 70 kDa band of the Δ1-88 mutant, a fainter lower band of approximately 55 kDa representing the deglycosylated form (which appeared in some preparations) and the PNGase F treated form of Δ1-88 (approximately 50 kDa; see Figure 2C) as well as the T339A and S483A mutants. Tryptic digestion of the lower band of Δ1-88 revealed an intense peak of m/z 1654.79 which may represent the fragment YLADNAPDAYDQTLR, while the spectrum of the upper band lacks this peak completely (Figure 6B). Due to the Δm/z of +1 as compared to the expected peptide, the lower band may result from deglycosylation, by an endogenous yeast PNGase, of the higher molecular weight form at N337 and conversion of this residue to Asp; however, possibly due to the heterogeneity and size of yeast glycans (Figure 6A), the corresponding glycopeptide from the upper band was itself not detected. Consistent with actual glycosylation of N337 in the upper band form, an m/z 1654.72 peak was present after treatment of FucTA with PNGase F (Figure 6B).In the case of the N420-containing peptide, a peak of m/z ~1643.9, potentially representing the non-glycosylated fragment DGNLTLEALESAVLAK (expected m/z 1643.88) was also identified in both bands. A potential shift in the isotopic distribution towards an m/z 1644.84 peak, which could correspond to DGDLTLEALESAVLAK, can be observed in the deglycosylated sample (Figure 6B) and is concluded to be compatible with partial glycosylation at this site. The third glycosylation site, N481, is within the sequence FEGNSSLSTHIQR; the presence of species of m/z 1475.7 and 1476.7 (as compared to the expected non-glycosylated m/z of 1475.7) may also indicate the presence of forms of the enzyme which either were never glycosylated at this site or became deglycosylated during or after secretion. Finally, peptide maps of the T339A and S483A mutants indicate the success of site-directed mutagenesis as judged by the respective lack of the ‘wild type’ peptides (YLADNPDAYNQTLR and FEGNSSLSTHIQR) and the appearance of the peptides predicted to correspond to the mutated sequences (data not shown).N- and C-terminal truncation studies were performed on plant and worm core fucosyltransferases FucTA and FUT-1 in order to determine the extent of their minimal catalytic domains. Due to the lack of expression of the Δ1-95 form, it can only be inferred that the border between the stem and catalytic domains of C. elegans FUT-1 is located between residues 79-95; previous studies on the other enzyme in this study, A. thaliana FucTA, suggested that this border is between residues 88-95 with C90 being the first generally-conserved residue in plant core fucosyltransferases (Bencúrová et al. 2003). Furthermore, we also examined whether the extra C-terminal subdomain unique to plant core α1,3-fucosyltransferases is essential for the enzyme activity. From bioinformatics analyses, we proposed that the beginning of this subdomain should begin after a ‘hinge’ sequence comprising more than one proline residue, located next to the region which shows sequence similarity to other higher eukaryotic members of the GT10 family; in comparison, the nematode FUT-1 lacks such a large C-terminal domain. However, the deletion of the final 113 residues of FucTA and the final 10 residues of FUT-1 led to dramatic (>99%) decreases in activity. Thereby, our results confirmed that GT10 members of higher eukaryotes are sensitive to manipulation on their C-termini (Augé C et al. 2000), while the N-terminal CTS domain is not essential for the enzyme activity and can be replaced by other sequences such as His- or FLAG-tags. Interestingly, a contrast to this ‘rule’ is the bacterial FucT from Helicobacter pylori, which is not a type II transmembrane protein and which retains activity despite deletion of its C-terminal domain consisting of 115 residues (Sun et al. 2007).Many other eukaryotic members of the GT10 family have been biochemically characterised over the years. The pH optimum for Golgi-type members of the GT10 family such as FucT from Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry) is pH 7.0, while that of human FucT-VII encoded by the FUT7 gene is pH 7.5 and that of human FucT-V encoded by the FUT5 gene is between pH 5.0 and 7.0 (Palma et al. 2001; Shinoda et al. 1997; Holmes et al. 1995). The pH optimum of recombinant FucTA was found to be between pH 6.0 and 7.0 with maximal activity at pH 6.5, while recombinant FUT-1 displays maximal activity at pH 7.5. Therefore, the pH optima of our enzymes are within the usual range for Golgi-type α1,3-/1,4-fucosyltransferases. Since the Golgi complex displays pH around 6.5 in different organisms (Seksek et al. 1995; Kim et al. 1996; Llopis et al. 1998), such pH optima are consistent with the intracellular milieu of these enzymes.Some glycosyltransferases including fucosyltransferases with a GT-B fold require divalent metal ions for their optimal activity, even if there is no evidence for a bound metal ion being involved in catalysis in such enzymes (Breton et al. 2006). On the other hand, glycosyltransferases sharing the GT-A fold or its variant very often possess a DXD motif (Breton et al. 2006) or a similar sequence such as EXD, DXE or EXE involved in coordination of divalent metal ions required for their activity. Consistent with the possession of a GT-B fold, divalent metal ions are not essential for the activity of human FucT-III encoded by the FUT3 gene, but addition of Mn(II) boosted the enzyme activity and caused an increase in the affinity for the acceptor (Palma et al. 2004). The same feature was described in the case of human FucT-V and also alternative divalent metal cofactors were identified, such as Ca(II), Co(II) and Mg(II) (Murray et al. 1997). The Lea-forming FucT from Silene alba requires Mg(II) or Mn(II) for activity and is inhibited by Zn(II) (Léonard et al. 2005). In the case of recombinant FucTA, assaying dialysed enzyme either in the presence of EDTA or the absence of exogenous divalent cations did not cause a complete lack of activity, but resulted in approximately 95% less activity as compared to the control assay in which Mn(II) was present. Divalent metal ions as Mg(II), Ca(II), Ni(II) and Co(II) ions also significantly stimulated the enzyme, while Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions were inhibitory. Comparable results were obtained in the case of FUT-1 except that this enzyme is not so dependent on divalent metal ions; in the presence of EDTA the enzyme retained some 20% of its control activity.In the case of the GDP-Fuc donor substrate, the Km value was determined to be 100 μM for soluble forms of both FucTA and FUT-1, as compared to 70 μM for H. pylori FucT (Ma et al. 2006), 20 μM for human FucT-VI (Jost et al. 2005) and 16 μM for human FucT-VII (Shinoda et al. 1997). Thus, our Km values are within a similar range to those of other GT10 family members.Based on our bioinformatic analyses, we define a new motif (‘first cluster’) present in GT10 fucosyltransferases, whether core or Lewis-type, located between the donor-binding motifs IV and V as defined by Mollicone et al (2009). As the conserved serine of this motif forms a hydrogen bond with the donor substrate, we compared the impact of mutating this residue in our two enzymes. The FUT-1 (S243) mutation did not lead to complete abolition of enzyme activity (20% residual activity) as observed in the case of FucTA (S218); this result was unexpected as all the previously described mutations of the conserved residues of the donor binding pocket led to a dramatic drop of activity (Sherwood et al. 1998; Jost et al. 2005). Since FUT-1 uses also a different acceptor substrate compared to other core α1,3-fucosyltransferases which are dependent on the presence of the GlcNAc residue, transferred by GlcNAcT-I, the binding pocket might be changed in a way that a modification of this conserved residue which otherwise leads to a loss of activity has less dramatic effects on the activity of the FUT-1. Evidently, this conserved serine residue is not the only determinant of the donor substrate binding and its importance may vary among the GT10 members.Other alanine replacements were based on modelling of FucTA using the H. pylori FucT as a template. For instance, N219 and R226 of FucTA, which are predicted to form hydrogen bonds with the β phosphate of the GDP ligand were examined. Whereas the R226A mutant displayed no activity, the N219A mutant showed a residual activity of approximately 1% and an apparent increase in Km value for GDP-Fuc. Alanine replacement of Y243, which may interact with the lone pair of guanine’s N7, decreased the enzyme activity by approximately 90% and also resulted in an increase in the Km value for GDP-Fuc; these data indicate roles for these three residues in donor binding. Interestingly, alanine replacement of S253, which might form a hydrogen bond with the guanine of the donor substrate, resulted in retention of around 35% of activity and no change in the Km value for GDP-Fuc. Considering the distance between this residue and the assumed active site, the contribution of S253 to the reaction mechanism remains unclear.As with many Golgi proteins, eukaryotic fucosyltransferases are N-glycosylated. For instance, human α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases III, -V, and -VI (FucT-III, -V, and -VI) contain two conserved C-terminal N-glycosylation sites (FucT-III: N154 and N185; FucT-V: N167 and N198; and FucT-VI: N153 and N184). Compared to wild types, FucT-V and -VI mutants of the first conserved glycosylation site as well as double mutations led to a loss of activity whereas the N198Q and N185Q mutants decreased the activity more than three-fold. The FucT-III glycosylation site mutant N154Q exhibited ~15%, the N153Q/N185Q double mutant ~5%, and N185Q ~38% of the control activity. Moreover, tunicamycin-mediated inhibition of N-glycosylation in cells expressing FucT-III resulted in a complete absence of activity of the recombinant enzyme, while castanospermine treatment, which affects processing of N-linked oligosaccharides, diminished activity by approximately 60% as compared to the native enzyme (Christensen et al. 2000a; Christensen et al. 2000b).The first of the sites conserved in human FucT-III, -V and -VI is also conserved in C. elegans fucosyltransferases (Paschinger et al. 2004). In the case of C. elegans FUT-1, the corresponding glycosylation site mutant (N194Q) was only expressed at a low level, which may be due to improper folding. On the other hand, the analysis of N-glycosylation site mutants of A. thaliana FucTA indicates that N-glycosylation is not absolutely essential for activity. Certainly, we observed that P. pastoris produces incompletely glycosylated isoforms of FucTA; in part, as judged by the presence of Asp at predicted Asn sites in samples not treated with PNGase F, this may be due to an endogenous PNGase activity. Indeed, the results of mass spectral fingerprinting, glycan analysis, Western blotting and mutagenesis suggest that all the three N-glycosylation sites may be glycosylated by a range of oligomannosidic N-glycans, but that occupation of these sites is incomplete; it is unknown whether partial occupancy of glycosylation sites is also a phenomenon in planta.To summarise, our data support the premise that N-glycosylation is necessary for the expression of full enzymatic activity of GT10 family members and in some cases may also important for the stability and proper folding of the enzyme. Thereby, at least one or more potential sites have to be occupied for optimal activity; however, results with the triple mutant of FucTA reveal that an unglycosylated core α1,3-fucosyltransferase is still catalytically active. Furthermore, the definition, modelling and mutagenesis of the first cluster motif extends our knowledge regarding the mode of donor substrate binding in the GT10 family; nevertheless clear conclusions can only be made using a crystal structure and preparation of the unglycosylated form of FucTA may represent a way forward in terms of obtaining more detailed data on eukaryotic α1,3-fucosyltransferases.The structure of FucT from Helicobacter pylori (Sun et al. 2007; PDB code: 2NZY) served as a template for homology modeling. The most conserved regions of H. pylori FucT and A. thaliana FucTA were aligned to model the donor binding pocket of the A. thaliana FucTA. Several alignments of these sequences were used to build models by Modeller9v1 (Eswar et al. 2007). The obtained model was then visualised and protonated using the UCSF Chimera program (Sanner et al. 1996, Pettersen et al. 2004, Goddard et al. 2005) in the presence of the donor substrate. Data for GDP-Fucose were retrieved from the PDB: 2NZY structure. Charge -2 was assigned to the donor substrate and a subsequent energy minimisation was performed using the AMBER’s (v. 10) molecular mechanical force field 99SB, where charges for the donor substrate were assigned by Gasteiger charges (Ponder and Case 2003, Case et al. 2008).The pPICZαC vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was modified by inverse PCR to insert a region encoding a FLAG tag or hexahistidinyl-FLAG tag just upstream of the multiple cloning site but downstream of the region encoding the Ste13 signal cleavage site. These derivatives are designated pPICZαFLAGC3 and pPICZαHisFLAG.For the study of core α1,3-fucosyltransferase A (FucTA) from A. thaliana, a set of gene constructs was ligated into forms of the pPICZαC vector. Truncation mutants of FucTA were prepared by PCR amplification from the construct pPICZαC/Δ1-66 FucTA (Bencúrová et al. 2003) using relevant pairs of primers (Table I), the DyNAzyme EXT polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) and the buffer supplied by the manufacturer containing 15mM MgCl2 under the following conditions: one cycle of 95 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 45 sec at 47–55 °C, 1-2 min at 72 °C and with a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR fragments were gel purified (Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and incubated for 1 h with KpnI at 37 °C prior to addition of EcoRI, after which time the digestion was continued for one further hour. The pPICZαFLAGC3 and pPICZαHisFLAG plasmids were cut under the same conditions as for the PCR products and were generally treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) during the final half-hour of restriction digestion. PCR fragments were then ligated into either pPICZαFLAGC3 or pPICZαHisFLAG vector for 3 h at room temperature using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas) and a standard ligase buffer.PCR primers employed in this studyPoint mutants of FucTA were prepared by inverse PCR amplification using pPICZαFLAGC3/Δ1-88 FucTA or pPICZαHisFLAG/Δ1-88 FucTA as templates and pairs of phosphorylated mutation primers (listed in Table 1). To perform the inverse PCR, Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) together with its buffer was used under the following conditions: one cycle of 95 °C for 2 min, 16 cycles of 45 sec at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 13 min 40 sec at 68 °C. Inverse PCR products were gel purified and ligated as above. After transformation into E. coli DH5α cells and plating the cells on LB/low-salt agar containing zeocin (25 μg/ml; Invitrogen), positive clones were selected after PCR screening and by sequencing to confirm the reading frame.To facilitate expression in P. pastoris of FUT-1 variants, the pPICZαFLAGC3 shuttle vector was used. Fragments encoding truncated forms of FUT-1 were amplified using PCR and primers specific for the K08F8.3 reading frame (Table I). The Expand PCR High fidelity system (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was used with C. elegans cDNA as template (Paschinger et al. 2004). PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle of 95 °C for 3 min, 30 sec at 50 °C, 2 min 30 sec at 72 °C, one cycle of 95 °C for 30 sec, 30 sec at 51 °C, 5 min at 72 °C, 10 cycles of 95 °C for 30 sec, 30 sec at 58 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 sec, 30 sec at 58 °C, 3 min + 5 sec per cycle at 72 °C, and with a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR fragments and the vector were gel purified (with the GFX kit); these were incubated at 37°C for 3h with PstI, XbaI, and BSA in Buffer 3 (all four components from New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and then heated for 15 min at 80°C to inactivate the enzymes. In case of the vector, alkaline phosphatase was added after 2.5 hours. The restricted DNA was then purified by ethanol precipitation. PCR fragments were ligated into the pPICZαFLAGC3 vector.Four different point mutations (N194Q, S243A, D303E, T361A) were generated by inverse PCR. The pPICZαFLAGC3/Δ1-78 FUT-1 construct was used as the basis for these mutations. For inverse PCR, the KOD hot start kit (Merck Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany) and specific primers (Table I) were used under the following conditions: one step of 95 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 1 min at 60 °C, 5 min at 72°C, and a final extension step of 4 min at 72 °C. Purified inverse PCR products were then ligated and selected positive clones were sequenced to confirm the reading frame and the mutation.Two to ten μg of the expression construct plasmid DNA was linearized by PmeI (MssI) and used to electroporate P. pastoris competent cells (GS115), which were then plated on YPDS agar containing zeocin (100 μg/ml). Screening by PCR amplification of genomic DNA, using plasmid or insert specific primers, confirmed the integration of the relevant expression cassette. Selected colonies of recombinant P. pastoris were inoculated into 10 ml of pre-culture glycerol-containing MGYC medium containing 100 μg/ml zeocin. After overnight incubation at generally 30 °C with continuous shaking (200 rpm) in baffled flasks, cells where collected by centrifugation at 1500 × g. The cells were washed once in 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base solution and resuspended in methanol-containing MMYC medium to a starting OD600 = 1.5. Every 24 h samples of the cultures cultivated at 18°C were removed and extra methanol added to maintain a concentration of 1% (v/v).Purification of the reference and mutant forms of FucTA (Δ1-88) was done by HisTrap affinity chromatography. After expression, phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (final concentration 0.1 mg/ml) was added to the culture medium (150 ml), which was then centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged again at 45,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was then concentrated using an Amicon device (cut off 15 kDa) to approximately 25 ml and dialysed against equilibration buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 7 mM imidazole, pH 8.5) and loaded on the equilibrated HisTrap column. The column was then washed with 25 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 7 mM imidazole, pH 8.5. Proteins were eluted with 25 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8.5 prior to extensive dialysis against 25 mM Tris buffer, pH 7, containing 150 mM NaCl to remove any Ni(II) leaching from the column.The supernatant from the FUT-1 expression culture (30 ml) was concentrated on Amicon (cut off 10kDa) and at the same time buffered to Affigel Blue running conditions (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7). The enzyme concentrate was then incubated with ca. 6 ml Affigel Blue for 1 hour on a rotating mixer in the cool room. All chromatography steps were carried out at 4°C. After filling of the column, the gel was washed with two column volumes of starting buffer, while 2 ml fractions were collected. Eluted protein was then concentrated (approximately 50 times, same device as above) and rebuffered with 25mM Tris, pH 7.Up to 10 μl of Pichia supernatant or diluted purified enzyme preparations were pipetted into the wells of MaxiSorb ELISA plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), then 40 μl of 50 mM Na2CO3, pH 9, were added. The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 2h (or overnight at 4°C). The wells were emptied, washed once with TTBS (200 μl), and then blocked at 37°C with TTBS containing 0.5% BSA (100 μl) for one hour. The wells were then emptied and murine anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1:5000 in TBS containing 0.5% BSA (50 μl), was applied. After 1 hour incubation at 37°C, the wells were washed three times, then the secondary antibody, anti Mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:5000 in TBS containing 0.5% BSA; 50 μl), was added. After incubation and washing as above, 1mg/ml p-nitrophenyl-phosphate (pNP-phosphate) in 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 was added (150 μl), the plate was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour or measured each 10 min, then the reaction was stopped by addition of 5 M NaOH (50 μl). The plate was then analyzed with a SLT Spectra plate reader at 405 nm. Calibration was done using a FLAG-BaP positive control (Sigma-Aldrich).Several forms of A. thaliana FucTA were assayed using GnGnF6-NST-dansylated glycopeptide as acceptor substrate. Reactions containing 0.05 mM acceptor, 1 mM GDP-Fuc, 10 mM MnCl2, 50 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulphonic acid (MES), pH 6.5 and 4 μl of enzyme preparation at a suitable dilution, to avoid substrate conversion higher than 20% (thus staying in the linear range), were performed in a final volume of 10 μl. The amount of enzyme added to each reaction was calculated on the basis of Anti-FLAG reactivity in ELISA as compared to a FLAG-BaP control which has a similar Mr to FucTA. Enzymatic assay mixtures were incubated 1hr at 30°C and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using a Hypersil ODS C18 5 μm column (250 × 4.0 mm; MZ Analysentechnik, Mainz, Germany) under isocratic conditions (flow 1.5 ml/min, for 15 min) with 8.5 % of solvent B (solvent B: 95% acetonitrile in water; Solvent A: 0.05% TFA in water). Excitation λ was set on 315 nm and emission λ on 550 nm.For measurements of divalent metal ion dependence, reaction mixtures with and without 10 mM divalent metal chlorides were prepared. For depletion of residual divalent metal ions, reaction mixtures with 10 mM EDTA and without addition of divalent metal ions were prepared. To establish the pH optima, reaction mixtures with 50 mM MES, for the pH range 5.5 - 6.8, and 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), for the pH range 6.8 – 9.5, were prepared. To determine the Km value for GDP-Fuc reaction mixtures with 0.06, 0.111, 0.2, 0.333 and 1 mM GDP-Fuc were prepared.Dansylated glycopeptides carrying either the MMF6 or Man5 glycan structures were used as acceptors at 0.15 nmol/μl. GDP-Fuc was, except for the Km value assays, always added to a final concentration of 1 mM. HEPES or MES buffers were used at a final concentration of 40 mM. MgCl2 solution was added to a final concentration of 10 mM, as were the other cation solutions in the relevant assays. The amount of enzyme added to each reaction was calculated on the basis of Anti-FLAG reactivity in ELISA as compared to a FLAG-BaP control which has a similar Mr to FUT-1. For the Km value for GDP-Fuc as well as the comparison of FUT-1 mutants, assays (2 hrs at 23 °C) were performed in the presence of HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 0.02, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2 or 2 mM GDP-Fuc and dansyl-MMF6 as acceptor. The enzyme incubations were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC employing an MZ Analysentechnik Hypersil column as above, but with 7 % of solvent B for isocratic elution when using Man5 as the acceptor substrate or 8.5 % when using MMF6.SDS-PAGE was performed using 10% polyacrylamide gels; staining was performed using Coomassie blue. For Western blotting, a semi-dry transfer procedure was employed and after blocking, the membranes were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the FLAG-epitope (1:5000); proteins were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG raised in goat (1:5000). As required, protein samples were precipitated using a five-fold excess of methanol prior to electrophoresis.Mass spectral fingerprinting of SDS-PAGE separated proteins was performed after excision of bands of interest from the gel; after a series of washing steps, proteins were reduced and alkylated in situ, prior to further washing. After drying of the gel pieces, one gel volume of 12.5 μg/ml modified trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Applied Science) in 20 mM NH4HCO3 was added. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, the gel pieces were washed with 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA to extract the peptides prior to MALDI TOF/MS.A portion of the partially purified enzymes was deglycosylated using N-glycosidase F from Roche Applied Science, using the manufacturer’s standard protocol for complete removal of N-glycans, prior to SDS-PAGE. For analysis of released N-glycans, a portion of a tryptic digest of FucTA was incubated using glycerol free PNGase F from New England Biolabs, prior to purification of glycans with a mini-column (containing Dowex AG 50 and LiChroprep® resins) and analysis by MALDI TOF/MS.MALDI-TOF MS and MS/MS was performed using a Bruker Ultraflex TOF-TOF (Bremen, Germany) instrument with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as matrix for dansylated glycopeptides and glycans or with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid for dabsylated glycopeptides and tryptic peptides. MS/MS of the fucosylated Man5GlcNAc2 dansyl-peptide was performed on an ion trap LC-MS (Agilent XTC ultra).Supplementary Figure 1 (Sequence alignment of regions of 47 GT10 members delineating the first cluster and α1,3 FucT motifs)Supplementary Figure 2 (Sequence alignment of the first cluster motif of all Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens α1,3/4-fucosyltransferases)Supplementary Figure 3 (Alignment of HCA plots of key regions of selected fucosyltransferases).

We propose that this region could also account for binding of the terminal GlcNAc of the acceptor.

PMC3303602,Diet drives convergence in gut microbiome functions across mammalian phylogeny and within humans,False,"Co-evolution of mammals and their gut microbiota has profoundly effected their radiation into myriad habitats. We used shotgun sequencing of microbial community DNA and targeted sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to understand how microbial communities adapt to extremes of diets, sampling fecal DNAs from 33 mammalian species and 18 humans who kept detailed diet records. We found that microbiota adaptation to diet is reproducible across different mammalian lineages. Functional repertoires of microbiome genes, such as those encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes and proteases, can be predicted from bacterial species assemblages. These results illustrate the value of characterizing vertebrate gut microbiomes to fully understand host evolutionary histories at a supra-organismal level.Comparative culture-independent metagenomic studies of the microbial species assemblages that comprise mammalian gut microbiota, and the functions that these communities encode in their aggregate genomes (microbiomes) can provide a complementary perspective to comparative studies of host genomes. A previous bacterial 16S rRNA-based study of 59 mammalian species revealed that their fecal microbiota clustered according to diet rather than host phylogeny (1). This finding raises several questions. What is the functional evolution of the gut microbiome in relation to diet? Is the process unique to each mammalian lineage? To what extent does microbial phylogeny predict function within microbial communities? Could analysis of inter-specific differences among mammals create a pipeline for deciphering intra-specific differences among humans in response to varied diets or other factors? Therefore, we have extended our 16S rRNA studies to a broader sampling of microbial genes in total fecal community DNA prepared from herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores.We generated shotgun pyrosequencing datasets from 33 mammalian species, along with newly collected bacterial 16S rRNA data. These adult animals represent 10 Orders, and varied digestive physiologies (hindgut-fermenters, foregut-fermenters, simple-gut). In some cases free-living and captive representatives of a given species were sampled (Table 1, Table S1). Methods for classifying diets, as well as collecting and processing fecal samples for metagenomic analyses have been described (1). Multiplex pyrosequencing of amplicons generated from the V2 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes yielded 149,675 high-quality, de-noised reads (average 3,838±1,080/sample; Table S2) (2). After chimera removal, 8,541 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in the combined dataset (an OTU was defined as reads sharing ≥97% nucleotide sequence identity). Shotgun sequencing of the same fecal DNA preparations produced 2,163,286 reads (mean 55,469±28,724 (S.D.)/sample; 261+83 nt/read) (Table S3)(2). Shotgun reads were functionally annotated using KEGG [KEGG Orthology (KO) groups and Enzyme Commission (E.C.) numbers], CAZy (carbohydrate-active enzymes) and MEROPS (peptidase) databases (3–5). When shotgun reads were assigned to phylogenetic bins using the program MEGAN (6), the results revealed that fecal microbiomes were dominated by members of Bacteria, had low levels of Eukarya (0.15–5.35% of identifiable reads), and archaeons were variably represented (0–1.77% of assignable reads with none detected in any carnivore microbiome). Seventeen samples had reads assigned to known viruses (Table S4)(2).Overview of mammals in this studyLegend:Procrustes analysis (least-squares orthogonal mapping) was used to test whether the functional properties of a microbiome can be predicted from the bacterial species that comprise it (2). Procrustes analysis attempts to stretch and rotate the points in one matrix, such as points obtained by Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), to be as close as possible to points in the other matrix, thus preserving the relative distances between points within each matrix (7,8) (Fig. 1A). We first took the 16S rRNA dataset and used the UniFrac metric to compare the overlap between each pair of communities in terms of their evolutionary distance (9). The similarity in functional profiles was then determined using the Bray-Curtis distance metric applied to KO groups, E.C.s, CAZYmes, or peptidases. Principal coordinates reduction was performed separately on the 16S rRNA and annotated shotgun (microbiome) datasets, and the point clouds were aligned using Procrustes. For each comparison, the goodness of fit, or M2 value, of the transformed datasets was measured over the first three dimensions. The statistical significance of the goodness of the fit was measured by a Monte Carlo label permutation approach (2).(A) Cartoon illustrating Procrustes analysis. The Procrustes transformation of the blue and red data types (i) results in a good fit, while the transformation of the green and red data (ii) yields a worse fit with large distances separating data from samples B and C. (B–E) Procrustes analysis of 16S rRNA sequences (weighted UniFrac) against KEGG Orthology (KO) groups, CAZymes (glycoside hydrolases), peptidases, and E.C.s. Every sphere represents a single mammalian fecal community and is colored by host diet. The black end of each line connects to the 16S data for the sample, while the orange end is connected to the functional annotation data. The fit of each Procrustes transformation over the first three dimensions, is reported as the M2 value.The agreement between phylogenetic and functional measurements was remarkable for all mammals, regardless of their diet, host lineage or gut physiology. Fig. 1B–E shows how the goodness-of-fit was robust to different functional databases. The analysis was also robust to taxon- or phylogenetic-based species classification, weighted or unweighted metrics, and whether one or more member of each mammalian species was considered (Fig. S1). For both bacterial 16S rRNA and whole community gene datasets, the PCoA plots separated carnivores and omnivores from herbivores, emphasizing the importance of diet in differentiating gut microbial communities (p<0.05, 2). Our previous study using full-length 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the fecal microbiota of conspecifics were significantly more similar than the communities of different host species (1). The V2 16S rRNA data generated in this study confirmed this result using both weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances (p<0.05 by 1,000 Monte Carlo permutations (2).The Procrustes results prompted us to use a nearest-neighbor model to test whether the functional configuration of a microbiome could be predicted from its 16S rRNA sequences. Remarkably, using a fecal sample’s nearest neighbor, as defined by unweighted or weighted UniFrac, to predict the sample’s functional profile generated a significantly better prediction than a random neighbor; this was true for KOs, E.C.s, CAZymes, and peptidases (p <0.0001, 106 Monte Carlo permutations) (2).The concordance of diet and microbiome structure and function raises the question of whether it is caused primarily by co-evolution between mammals and their gut microbiota/microbiome, or by the many parallel dietary shifts that have occurred over the course of mammalian evolution (10). We tested which of these hypotheses, which have traditionally been viewed as competing but need not be mutually exclusive, were supported by looking for congruence between mammalian phylogeny and subsets of bacterial species, KOs, CAZymes, peptidases, or other enzymatic activities. Briefly, the mammalian phylogenetic tree defines sets of organisms that are monophyletic, i.e. groups containing all and only the descendants of a common ancestor. We reasoned that if bacterial taxa or functions originated rarely, then these taxa or functions should be vertically transmitted during mammalian speciation. Therefore, there should be more cases in which a given taxon or function occurred in all members of a monophyletic mammalian group than chance would predict. Using this analytic approach (2), we found that the overall distribution of microbial species and microbiome functions in the gut do not mirror mammalian phylogeny. 198 different named bacterial genera were detected in our dataset – of these, only three were significantly associated with the mammalian phylogenetic tree more than would be expected by chance (Prevotella, Barnesiella, and Bacteroides). No CAZymes or peptidases and only 18 of the 3,866 KOs tested were associated with host phylogeny. We repeated the analysis using a more relaxed constraint that a taxon or function occurs in a given monophyletic group more frequently than expected by chance rather than requiring strict presence/absence agreement (2). The relaxed definition gave similar results; only three additional genera and a total of 90 KOs were detected as having a significant association with the mammalian tree. We concluded that bacterial taxa and functions are evolutionarily labile and do not explain the concordance between bacterial communities and microbiome functions.Bipartite network analysis provided an additional tool for exploring the interrelationship between host diet, host lineage, gut physiology, and shared and unique bacteria taxa (1). Mammalian hosts and bacterial OTUs were used as nodes in a bipartite graph, with edges connecting OTU nodes to the hosts in which they are found (2). Using 1,900 V2 16S rRNA sequences from each mammalian host, the network shows clear separation of fecal communities by host diet (Fig. 2A), mirroring our earlier results based on smaller numbers of full-length 16S rRNA sequences (1).(A–B) Bipartite network diagrams of evenly sampled bacterial 16S rRNA-derived OTUs (A) or KOs (B). Edges connecting mammalian nodes (circles) to species-level OTUs or KOs found in that sample are colored by host diet. Sample labels are removed from the KO diagram for legibility (high-resolution image of removed labels presented in Fig. S2). (C) Mammalian gut communities share a core suite of KOs. Using evenly subsampled OTU or KO datasets, the distribution of counts is plotted as a function of the number of mammalian host microbiomes where the KO or phylotype was detected. The results demonstrate exponential decay for the 16S rRNA data, with no OTU or bacterial species found in all samples, although a “core” set of KOs is detectable in all fecal communities sampled.We reasoned that the bipartite graph approach could also be used to connect mammalian samples to individual microbial gene functions from shotgun reads. The power of the bipartite graph approach is to represent both genes and mammalian species explicitly as nodes, thus visualizing which genes connect with which species. The clear separation by diet disappears when we consider gene functions (Fig. 2B, Fig. S2), suggesting that rather than a diet- or physiology-specific set of genes, the relationship among mammalian gut microbiomes is that they share a large core repertoire of functions. We confirmed this result by plotting the frequency of shared taxa in the 39 mammalian fecal samples, and also species- and genus-level OTU bins (2). All of the curves demonstrate an essentially exponential decay as successive samples are added, with no OTUs found in more than 30 samples (Fig. 2C). However, the plot of KO frequency flattens out, with 35 KOs found in all samples. This effect cannot be due to differences in the number of OTUs relative to KOs: there are more OTUs than KOs, and fewer assigned species or assigned genera, yet all the taxonomic curves show the same rapid decay, unlike the KOs.This result does not imply that there are no differences among the functional configurations of microbiomes of host species having different diets. Rather, it suggests that the differences between microbiomes likely stem from differing abundances of shared functions, such as enzymes that break down chemical substrates in host diet. We identified 495 E.C.s with significantly different proportional abundance in the 7 carnivorous and 21 herbivorous mammalian microbiomes using the program Shotgun FunctionalizeR (adjusted p<0.001 after multiple hypothesis correction, Table S5) (11). Many of the enzymes distinguishing carnivorous and herbivorous fecal microbiomes are involved in amino acid metabolism. Enzymes enriched in samples from herbivores mapped to biosynthetic reactions for 12 amino acids, while no enzymes for amino acid biosynthesis were enriched in sampled carnivores (Table S6). In contrast, nine amino acid degradation pathways contained enzymes enriched in carnivores, while the only degradative enzymes enriched in herbivores were for the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids (Val, Leu, Ile). Glutamate metabolism is particularly illustrative of these trends. Both the ATP-dependent and ATP-independent pathways for glutamate biosynthesis are significantly enriched in herbivore microbiomes, while the catabolic reactions to break down glutamate and glutamine are enriched in carnivores (Fig. 3A). These results suggest carnivorous microbiomes have specialized to degrade proteins as an energy source, while herbivorous communities have specialized to synthesize amino acid building blocks.(A) Carnivorous and herbivorous microbiomes indicate opposing directionality for amino acid metabolism. Colored arrows denote enzyme functions significantly (p<0.001) enriched in the fecal microbiomes of herbivores (green) or carnivores (red). (B) Carnivorous and herbivorous microbiomes suggest opposing directionality at the central PEP-Pyruvate-Oxaloacetate node. Coloring scheme as in panel A. Abbreviations: 2-OG, alpha-ketoglutarate; GABA, γ–aminobutyrate; DH, Dehydrogenase; OAA, Oxaloacetate; Dx, Decarboxylase; Ck, Carboxykinase; Cx, Carboxykinase; PEP, Phosphoenolpyruvate; Pyr, Pyruvate; SSA, Succinate-Semialdehyde.The distinctiveness of carnivorous and herbivorous microbiomes was also revealed at a central anaplerotic node (Fig 3B). When gluconeogenesis is required, oxaloacetate (OAA) can be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyruvate. When TCA cycle intermediates are withdrawn for biosynthesis, they are replenished by converting PEP and pyruvate directly to OAA (12). All of the genes encoding enzymes catalyzing OAA production from pyruvate or PEP are significantly increased in the carnivore microbiomes, while the reverse reactions are catalyzed by enzymes whose representation is increased in herbivore microbiomes.Our studies comparing mammalian species revealed a relationship between host diet and gut microbial community structure and function. We next asked if similar trends could be detected using diet variation within a single free-living host species, namely humans. Quantitative studies of diet in most human populations are complicated by the known inaccuracy of self-reported data (13), so we turned to a group of adults known to keep meticulous records about their daily food composition and consumption. The selected cohort consisted of 18 lean members of the Calorie Restriction Society who typically measure and record all components of their diets on a daily basis with computer software to insure optimal nutrition despite reduced energy intake (14,15). We collected their dietary records for a four-day period (conservatively encompassing at least one complete intestinal transit time) prior to obtaining a single fecal sample, and analyzed macro- and micro-nutrient consumption using a validated protocol (2,17). An average of 3,642±3,826 bacterial V2 16S rRNA reads and 54,295 ±28,086 shotgun reads were obtained per sample (Tables S7–S10).Procrustes analysis revealed a significant association between the bacterial phylogenetic structure of their fecal communities (16S rRNA) and the functions encoded in their microbiomes (p<0.05 for KOs, E.C.s, and CAZymes (glycoside hydrolases); not significant for peptidases [p=0.061]; Fig. S3). These results suggest that the processes that drive functional differentiation of microbiomes within an individual host species may be fundamentally similar to those that drive their differentiation across mammalian evolution.Documentation of the weight of each ingredient in each meal consumed by these individuals (Table S7) allowed us to perform a follow-up analysis examining the impact on fecal bacterial community configuration of three dietary components (total protein, carbohydrate, and insoluble fiber intake). We chose these diet categories because protein intake is markedly different between carnivores and herbivores, and because an extensive literature exists about the impact of ingested polysaccharides and fiber on the gut microbiota (17). Linear regression of the three dietary categories against the position of each individual’s microbiome along Principal Coordinate 1 of the PCoA plots revealed that total protein intake was significantly associated with KO data (adjusted R2 value=0.307, adjusted p-value=0.030)(2). In contrast, insoluble dietary fiber was significantly associated with bacterial OTU content (Bray-Curtis metric; adjusted R2 value=0.371; adjusted p-value=0.013) (Table S11). These results confirm that within a single free-living species, both the structure and function of the gut microbiome are significantly associated with dietary intake.Taken together with our prior work (1), these results teach us that even fecal samples from mammals living in zoos and human samples from a single self-selected population can provide insights into the factors driving the evolution of the gut microbiome. They also compel us, at a time when complete genomes are to be sequenced for 10,000 vertebrates (18), to take the next step and perform systematic studies that rigorously test specific mechanisms that drive the co-evolution of hosts and their (gut) microbial symbionts. These studies should be guided by experts who can choose taxa that radiated at different points in their evolutionary history, with parallel shifts in their diet, morphology, biogeography, or other key factors known or hypothesized to influence evolution. The results should help address questions such as what functional features in host intestinal environments (e.g., the biochemical characteristics of mucosal surfaces) are related to the representation of specific bacterial taxa and microbiome functions, and how readily microbial populations have been acquired and re-acquired during the course of vertebrate evolution. Additionally, our findings emphasize the need to sample humans across the globe with a variety of extreme diets and lifestyles, including relatively ancestral hunter-gatherer lifestyles, in order to provide new insights into the limits of variation within a host species and the possibility that our microbes, in coevolving with our bodies and our cultures, have help shaped our physiological differences and environmental adaptations.We thank Jill Manchester and Sabrina Wagoner for technical assistance, Brandi Cantarel, Vincent Lombard, Corinne Rancurel, and Pedro Coutinho for CAZyme annotation, Ruth Ley and members of the Gordon lab for their suggestions; and Stephen Bircher Rob Ramey, Michael Schlegel, Mark Schrenzel, Tammy Tucker, and Peter Turnbaugh for past help in procuring mammalian fecal samples.

PMC3815771,Life cycle analysis of the model organism Rhodopirellula baltica SH 1T by transcriptome studies,False,"The marine organism Rhodopirellula baltica is a representative of the globally distributed phylum Planctomycetes whose members exhibit an intriguing lifestyle and cell morphology. The analysis of R. baltica's genome has revealed many biotechnologically promising features including a set of unique sulfatases and C1‐metabolism genes. Salt resistance and the potential for adhesion in the adult phase of the cell cycle were observed during cultivation. To promote the understanding of this model organism and to specify the functions of potentially useful genes, gene expression throughout a growth curve was monitored using a whole genome microarray approach. Transcriptional profiling suggests that a large number of hypothetical proteins are active within the cell cycle and in the formation of the different cell morphologies. Numerous genes with potential biotechnological applications were found to be differentially regulated, revealing further characteristics of their functions and regulation mechanisms. More specifically, the experiments shed light on the expression patterns of genes belonging to the organism's general stress response, those involved in the reorganization of its genome and those effecting morphological changes. These transcriptomic results contribute to a better understanding of thus far unknown molecular elements of cell biology. Further, they pave the way for the biotechnological exploitation of R. baltica's distinctive metabolic features as a step towards sourcing the phylum Planctomycetes at large.Rhodopirellula baltica (RB) SH 1T was isolated from the water column in the Kiel Fjord (Baltic Sea) and taxonomically grouped within the bacterial phylum Planctomycetes (Schlesner et al., 2004). Members of this group are abundant in aquatic habitats and are considered to play a significant role in carbon cycling (Glöckner et al., 2003). Planctomycetes share several unique properties, such as peptidoglycan‐free proteinaceous cell walls (Liesack et al., 1986), intracellular compartmentalization (Lindsay et al., 2001) and a mode of reproduction via budding. The latter trait results in a life cycle comprised of motile and sessile morphotypes and resembles that of Caulobacter crescentus (Gade et al., 2005a). The annotation of the completely sequenced genome of R. baltica allowed an initial assessment of its genetic potential and revealed several interesting and surprising traits such as a high number of sulfatase genes, a fascinating set of carbohydrate‐active enzymes [CAZymes (Cantarel et al., 2009), (Michel et al., 2006; Dabin et al., 2008)] and a conspicuous C1‐metabolism pathway (Glöckner et al. 2003 and references therein). Moreover, several features were detected that promise a potential for biotechnological exploitation. For instance, the genome harbours enzymes for the synthesis of complex organic molecules with possible applications in the pharmaceutical field, such as a gene set encoding a polyketide synthase, and enzymes important for the production of natural products in the food or animal‐feed industry, such as those active in vitamin and amino acid biosynthesis. The application of sulfatases of R. baltica for the stereoselective conversion of racemates has been discussed in Wagner and Horn (2006) and Gadler and colleagues (2006). Many of the genes are unique and may be employed to enhance the efficiency of microbial strains already in biotechnical use. For example, genes coding for antibiotic resistance might be used to immunize production strains against certain antibiotics, while genes conferring virulence resistance could improve the robustness of these strains. Rhodopirellula baltica is capable of a sessile lifestyle, a feature which is desirable for cell recovery during the production of secreted products in biotechnological processes. Salt resistance is desirable for production strains as industrial media or waste water often have high salt concentrations. The fact that about half of the genes in R. baltica currently lack an assigned function further demonstrates the huge, but so far hidden, genetic potential of this model organism.During the life cycle of R. baltica, cells change their morphology, form swarmer cells to sessile cells with holdfast substances, produce secondary metabolites and experience different conditions such as nutrient excess and deprivation as well as high cell densities. The analysis of growth‐dependent expression patterns during the life cycle of R. baltica enables a screening for genes for specific physiological functions, morphotype differentiation and cellular processes most probably typical for this phylum.Rhodopirellula baltica was grown in a defined mineral medium with glucose as a sole carbon source to study changes in gene expression that reflect the organism's life cycle phases and response to nutrient depletion. The growth of R. baltica cells could not be synchronized. Nevertheless, microscopic examination showed that the culture is dominated by swarmer and budding cells in the early exponential growth phase, shifting to single and budding cells as well as rosettes in the transition phase, while the stationary phase is dominated by rosette formations. These observations are in accordance with previous results (Gade et al., 2005a).Cultures of R. baltica were harvested at the onset of the exponential phase (after 44 h of incubation), during the exponential phase (mid‐log phase, 62 h), in the transition phase between exponential and stationary phase (late‐log phase, 82 h), and in the early and late stationary phase (96 h and 240 h respectively). Figure 1 presents an overview of the system in which the different growth phases were compared. The total number of genes detected as differentially regulated for each of the growth stage investigated is shown in Table 1. A complete list of genes can be found in the Appendix S1. Samples taken from the early log‐phase (44 h) and the exponential phase (62 h) were differentiated by the up‐ and downregulation of 149 genes, of which 56% have been annotated as hypothetical proteins. The comparison between the exponential (62 h) and transition phase (82 h) revealed the regulation of only 90 genes, 40% of which have unknown functionality. A pronounced change in the transcriptome, with the differential regulation of 235 genes (59% hypothetical proteins), was observed when the transition phase (82 h) was compared with the stationary phase (96 h). A comparison between cultures from 82 h with those of late stationary phase (240 h) revealed the most pronounced changes of the transcriptome in our study: 863 genes were differentially expressed (Fig. 2), of which 58% are annotated as hypothetical proteins.Schematic drawing of the life cycle of R. baltica, modified after (Gade et al., 2005a) and hybridization scheme: R. baltica cultures were harvested at five time points indicated by the red circles. cDNA samples were hybridized in two replicates. Dots and arrowheads represent samples labelled with Alexa 547 and Alexa 647 respectively.Total number of regulated genes during each measured time point of the growth curve and the fraction of the regulated genes annotated as conserved and/or hypothetical.Number of significantly up‐ and downregulated genes during the growth curve at the four time points which were compared. White means upregulated and grey downregulated.The analysis of the exponential phase (a comparison of the early‐log at 44 h and late‐log at 82 h with mid‐log at 62 h) showed that a maximum fraction of 2% of the total number of genes was regulated. This reflects the favourable nutritional conditions encountered throughout these growth stages (Gade et al., 2005a).The assignment of differentially expressed genes to functional cluster of orthologous group (COG) classes offered a first impression of R. baltica's metabolic activity through the different growth stages (Table 2). Genes associated with the ‘metabolism of amino acids’[E] and ‘carbohydrates’[G], genes for ‘energy production and conservation’[C], as well as genes for ‘DNA replication and recombination’[L] were downregulated in mid‐exponential phase (62 h) in comparison with the 44 h sample. The repression (62 h vs. 44 h) of genes coding for oxidases (RB4416 and RB5701), a peptidase [RB4269, which was also found regulated under stress conditions (Wecker et al., 2009)], a synthase (RB6443) as well as lipases and esterases (RB7072 and RB3413) suggests a lower metabolic activity in the cells most likely due to lower nutrient availability compared with the early exponential phase.Number of regulated genes with an assigned COG‐category compared with the whole genome functional classification assignment according to the NCBI database (cut‐off e‐value e‐4).Rows: [C] Energy production and conversion, [D] Cell division and chromosome partitioning, [E] Amino acid transport and metabolism, [F] Nucleotide transport and metabolism, [G] Carbohydrate transport and metabolism, [H] Coenzyme metabolism, [I] Lipid metabolism, [J] Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, [K] Transcription, [L] DNA replication, recombination and repair, [M] Cell envelope biogenesis, outer membrane, [N] Cell motility and secretion, [O] Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones, [P] Inorganic ion transport and metabolism, [Q] Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism, [R] General function prediction only, [S] Function unknown, [T] Signal transduction mechanisms.Interestingly, genes of the ‘cell envelope biogenesis, outer membrane’[M] and ‘cell motility and secretion’[N] categories, such as genes coding for flagellin [RB4454; also downregulated under stress (Wecker et al., 2009)], bacterial type II and III secretion system protein (RB5174) and for diverse transferases (RB6305 and RB6624), were repressed at 62 h. Thus, when compared with the mid‐exponential phase (62 h), it appears that the onset of the exponential phase (44 h) triggers a remodelling of the cell wall and morphology, perhaps explained by an enhancement of the swarmer cell production. This response is likely to be very expensive energetically, and would explain the higher expression level of genes from COG category C observed (Jolly et al., 2007).Comparison of the transition phase and stationary growth phase (82 h) with the mid‐exponential phase (62 h) revealed that more genes were regulated in the stationary phase than the mid‐exponential. It could be speculated that genes necessary for exponential growth under favourable conditions were already expressed in early log and mid‐log phase (44 h and 62 h). Still, several genes showed differential expression. For example, R. baltica increased the glutamate dehydrogenase (RB6930) level, thus confirming proteome experiments (Hieu et al., 2008). The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of arginine, glutamate and proline. The latter is one of the major components of the R. baltica's cell wall. Upregulation of glutamate dehydrogenase could indicate that the organism's cell wall composition has been adapted to more unfavourable conditions in response to the decreasing nutrient concentration.The cell density reached its highest point during the transition phase of the R. baltica flask culture. Stressed cells need to adapt metabolically to the nutrient limitation in the culture, which is reflected by our results. Genes coding for glutathione peroxidase (RB2244), thioredoxin (RB12160, see also Hieu et al., 2008) and bacterioferritin comigratory protein (RB12362), universal stress protein (uspE, RB4742) and chaperones (e.g. RB8966) were induced and diverse dehydrogenases, hydrolases and reductases were up‐ and downregulated for metabolic adaptation and to prepare for long‐term survival under unfavourable conditions. The regulation of RB2244, RB12362, RB8966 is in line with the proteome results of the life cycle (Gade et al., 2005a).Earlier experiments have shown that R. baltica survives for at least 14 days in the stationary phase at 28°C (Gade et al., 2005a). We compared expression profiles of the early (96 h) and the late stationary phase (240 h) with that of the transition phase (82 h). The overlap of both sample sets (96 h vs. 82 h and 240 h vs. 82 h), visualized by a Venn diagram (Fig. 3), revealed 103 genes with similar regulation behaviour. Seventy‐one out of the 103 genes are annotated as hypothetical proteins and most of the remaining 32 genes are stress‐related, as expected.Venn diagrams showing the distribution of all regulated genes.The general response of R. baltica cells to the stationary phase environment includes the induction of genes associated with energy production, amino acid biosynthesis, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, stress response and protein folding. Genes coding for the enzymes of carbon metabolism, translation control, energy production and amino acid biosynthesis were repressed. Rhodopirellula baltica decreased the expression level of genes belonging to the ribosomal machinery (RB12197, RB2543, RB264, RB5801, RB5804, RB7022, RB7818, RB8253, RB8725 and RB9304), transcription regulation (RB10339, RB10458, RB11223, RB12372 and RB1392) and DNA replication and recombination (RB11863 and RB3281) in the late stationary phase, probably due to reduced growth activity. Additionally, the organism expressed many genes coding for transposases, integrases and recombinases (RB10096, RB11303, RB11750, RB1190, RB3144, RB4826, RB5887, RB7388, RB12239, RB2186, RB6736, RB9907, RB6167, RB7389 and RB934), suggesting that under stress conditions, or in the late stationary phase, genome rearrangements take place. Due to the scarcity of operon structures in the genome of R. baltica, the rearrangement might be necessary to enable an efficient transcription during stressful phases. Six out of the 15 genes (RB11750, RB12239, RB2186, RB9907, RB7389 and RB934) have been found active in response to non‐physiological conditions of temperature and salinity (Wecker et al., 2009), which indicates that expression of these genes constitutes a response to general stress. The upregulation of genes for the phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophane biosynthesis (RB6822 and RB6147) is noteworthy. This is consistent with proteome data (Gade et al., 2005a), but the physiological meaning is currently unknown. Furthermore, genes involved in the biosynthesis of serine, threonine and glycine (RB6932) and of lysine (RB4382) were upregulated.Reaction to oxygen depletion is shown as part of the stress response as well. It is known from Agrobacter tumefaciens and Rhodobacter sphaeroides that the lack of oxygen triggers the increased production of ubiquinone (Cluis et al., 2007). The same effect can be seen in our results with the induction of genes for the ubiquinone biosynthesis (RB2748, RB2749 and RB2750) in the stationary phase. Also, it seems that the composition of the cell wall was modified in response to changes in the physiological state of the R. baltica cell during the late stationary phase. The organism exported more polysaccharides, as shown by the enhanced formation of rosettes indicating production of a holdfast substance. Diverse genes belonging to the cell membrane class [M] were upregulated. Rhodopirellula baltica activated the production of many outer membrane transporters and biopolymers (RB12053, RB12055, RB9308, RB1120, RB754), as well as several transferases (RB12690, RB2507, RB2985, RB5846) for alteration of the lipopolysaccharides that belong to the cell membrane. RB12053, RB12055 and RB12690 showed also a response to stressful conditions in our earlier study (Wecker et al., 2009). In addition, we found 19 genes annotated as membrane proteins to be regulated, as well as 13 secreted proteins. Two genes coding for bacterial micro‐compartment proteins (RB2585 and RB2586) were upregulated. These proteins supposedly form primitive organelles in a variety of bacteria (Kerfeld et al., 2005). Such findings may indicate that the cell wall composition was adapted to maintain the cell shape. It could be that after entering the stationary phase, R. baltica cells, similar to what was found for the marine bacterium ‘Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique’, undergo morphological changes (cell shape), enabling them to return to exponential growth after being transferred to fresh medium or to a nutrient‐rich environment (Sowell et al., 2008).Little is known about the cell division and replication regulation in Planctomycetes. None of the 18 R. baltica genes assigned to the COG category ‘cell division and chromosome partitioning’[D] were found to be regulated during this study, nor were any of the unclassified COG homologues of genes that are generally known to be involved in the cell division. This suggests that in R. baltica a number of regulated genes with thus far unknown function must play a role in the regulation of replication and cell division. However, clues can be garnered from the fact that R. baltica exhibits a life cycle similar to C. crescentus. DnaK/DnaJ and GroES/GroEL are the best‐characterized chaperone systems in bacteria and are induced in cell cycle regulation and under heat shock in C. crescentus (Susin et al., 2006). Those chaperones have an important role in chromosome replication and partition and/or cell division. The R. baltica genome harbours genes coding for groEL (RB10629 and RB8970), dnaK (RB5754 and RB5755) and dnaJ[RB8972 (Wecker et al., 2009)] in the genome. Of these, only groEL (RB10629) is upregulated at 82 h (transition phase) in the life cycle experiment, which could also indicate a general response to stress (Wecker et al., 2009). In addition, both groEL‐genes showed a regulation during the proteome experiments (Gade et al., 2005a). Rhodopirellula baltica also possesses two genes encoding DnaA (RB11579 and RB1706), a protein which initiates not only the DNA replication, but also promotes the expression of the components necessary for successful chromosome duplication in C. crescentus. However, dnaA was not found to be regulated in our experiments.In order to acquire more knowledge about genes possibly involved in changes of the morphotype throughout the cell cycle and the role of genes classified as hypothetical proteins, the gene expression data were clustered (see Experimental procedures). Clusters can be found in Table 3 and Appendix S2. The clusters 4, 12 and 17 group genes which are only regulated in the exponential phase where nutrient limitation or stress conditions are unlikely. Therefore, these genes can be supposed to have a function in the morphology differentiation to swarmer cells or in the budding process. Genes belonging to clusters 11, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 are upregulated during the transition phase. Genes annotated as hypothetical proteins belonging to the early stationary phase (96 h) were grouped in clusters 18, 24 and 25. Cluster 18 and 24 consist of many genes annotated as hypothetical proteins, which might be involved in morphology changes, e.g. cell shape and wall. Finally, cluster 14 genes are upregulated in the exponential (62 h) and downregulated in the stationary (96 h) phase in comparison with the transition phase. This cluster contains one sulfatase gene and 14 genes encoding hypothetical proteins. It can be assumed that these have a function in the morphotype differentiation.Overview of the k‐means clustering of the different growth stages of R. baltica.In this study, delta‐9 desaturase (RB4876), which belongs to the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, was upregulated in the transition phase (82 h). Furthermore, expression of malonyl‐CoA acyl carrier protein transacylase (RB314), an enzyme involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, was upregulated in the late stationary phase (240 h). Results from proteome studies (Gade et al., 2005a) indicate that the biosynthesis of sulfated saturated fatty acids occurs specifically during the stationary phase, but this could not be reproduced on the transcriptome level. In our recent study (Wecker et al., 2009), RB314 (together with the acyl carrier protein, RB318) was also upregulated under stress‐inducing conditions. The increased expression of these genes might be part of a general stress response, possibly to enhance the stability of the membrane to protect the cell.Rhodopirellula baltica has the genetic potential to degrade C1‐compounds, and the functional annotation predicted all enzymes necessary for the oxidation of formaldehyde to formate (Glöckner et al., 2003). How this pathway benefits the organism in its environment is so far unknown. Out of the 19 proposed genes encoding enzymes of C1‐metabolism (Woebken et al., 2007), four genes were regulated in our experiment: fae (RB9338), mtdA (EC 1.5.1.5, RB10295) and orf7 (RB10246) were induced in the late stationary phase (240 h) compared with the transition phase (82 h), whereas orfY (RB10299) encoding a potential ATP‐dependent carboligase (COG2232) was induced in the exponential and repressed in the early stationary phase. Table 4 gives an overview on C1‐genes that have, to our knowledge, been found expressed so far. Although in silico studies show the presence of the C1‐pathway in other Planctomycetes (Chistoserdova et al., 2004; Woebken et al., 2007), the specific functions of the genes in Planctomycetes are still unknown. However, the expression of some genes observed in this study suggests that this pathway has physiological relevance in R. baltica and most likely in other Planctomycetes as well.Overview of the expressed or regulated genes coding for the C1‐transfer enzymes in R. baltica.Throughout the life cycle, biotechnologically interesting genes were found to be regulated. The microarray experiments provide valuable information under which conditions these genes are expressed and how they interact. With a doubling time of approximately 12 h and complex growth conditions, R. baltica has limitations as a production strain. Nevertheless, the respective genes could be cloned and heterologously expressed. Considered here are gene products relevant for (i) new biotechnological processes, (ii) the improvement of existing processes, (iii) processes which could help to shift classical chemical production towards enzyme catalysed systems and (iv) genes with potentially medical applications. An overview of the regulated genes organized according to their possible application is presented in Appendix S3.Food industry and animal feeding form a globally important market and many of the processes existing today leave room for improvements. Almost 50 genes of R. baltica, which were found to be differentially expressed in the present study, have potential applications in this field. Among them are genes for vitamin and sugar synthesis or amino acid conversion and several of the organism's sulfatase genes. The efficient and inexpensive synthesis of amino acids and vitamins is increasingly important as feed additives to raise livestock for a growing world population and sulfatases can be used in the food industry as thickening agent, and to convert racemates to single stereoisomers that may play a role in the pharmaceutical field.The 41 genes listed in the category ‘pharmaceutical & medical application’ have a potential to improve current biosynthesis methods for vitamins, antibacterial drugs or complex organic molecules synthesis, with applications in cancer research. The biotechnological production of certain amino acids is important for the pharmaceutical industry. An example would be the biosynthesis of tryptophan, which can be administered as a mild sleeping drug (Hartmann, 1977). An additional instance of a gene product that may be valuable for the development of new medical treatments is an FKBP‐like isomerase found to be differentially expressed in R. baltica. FKBP isomerases are involved in the immunoregulation.Other enzymes, such as polymerases, might improve methods in molecular biology and would therefore benefit medical research or analytical techniques. For example, nine polymerase‐associated genes are regulated in this study.In the emerging field of white biotechnology, R. baltica could offer genes to improve the robustness of existing production strains with respect to antibiotics and phage resistance, for the production of washing detergents, for the synthesis of natural substances or for waste water treatment. The ability of R. baltica to form a holdfast substance might prove valuable as well. In many biotechnology processes the biomass is harvested together with the desired product and thus lost, which leads to additional costs for replacing the production cells.Hence, it is favourable to retain the biomass during harvesting secreted proteins or enzymes, for example, by employing attached cells.The genome of R. baltica harbours an exceptional number of 110 sulfatase genes. Based on sequence similarity, it has been proposed that they are involved in the utilization of carbon from complex sulfated heteropolysaccharides (Glöckner et al., 2003).During transcriptional analysis of the different R. baltica growth stages, we found 12 sulfatases up‐ or downregulated including one putative choline sulfatase (RB2254), three different arylsulfatases (RB4815, RB684 and RB686), two N‐acetylgalactosamine‐6‐sulfate sulfatase (RB13148, RB5195), one mucin‐desulfating sulfatase and four other sulfatases (RB110, RB10612, RB5294 and RB5424) (Table 5). Organic sulfate is not likely to have caused the induction of the sulfatase genes observed in this study as the medium lacked sulfated carbon. Five of the sulfatase genes mentioned above (RB110, RB2254, RB4815, RB5294 and RB686) were also found upregulated when the expression profile of R. baltica cells grown on a solid surface was compared with that of cells grown in liquid culture (data not shown), and RB2254 was found in the extracellular proteome (data not shown). The observation that certain sulfatases were only expressed in specific growth phases suggests that degrading polymers is not the only role of sulfatase genes in R. baltica. Based on the differential expression pattern of these sulfatase genes we propose an involvement in structural remodelling during the morphological differentiation of R. baltica cells, such as the formation of the holdfast substance, which is needed to attach to surfaces, the production of slime polysaccharides (Kumar, 2007) or in the cell wall formation, which consists of a protein sacculus with disulfide bonds (Liesack et al., 1986).Differentially expressed sulfatase genes of R. baltica during the growth curve plus additional regulation data.W: transcriptome studies. cells attached to chemostat wall (unpublished data), M: metagenome studies (Woebken et al., 2007), P: extracellular proteome (Hieu et al., 2008), T: transcriptome data (Wecker et al., 2009).Another hypothesis is that, when sensing decreasing glucose concentrations, the cells express sulfatases to prepare for the degradation of alternative carbon sources. More experimental work is needed to clarify the diverse roles of the unusually high number of sulfatase genes in R. baltica.Carbohydrate‐active enzymes are responsible for the synthesis (glycosyltransferases), the modification (carbohydrate esterases) and the degradation [glycoside hydrolases (GH) and polysaccharide lyases] of polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, which play an important role in, e.g. cell wall synthesis and carbon storage. The degradation of carbohydrates taps a special nutrient source for the microorganisms (Michel et al., 2006). As the predicted lifestyle of R. baltica in its natural environment involves the attachment to and degradation of marine snow, its CAZymes might have a function in both the formation of the hold‐fast substance and the breakdown of marine snow particles. Similarly, the field of application in biotechnology comprises the degradation of complex substances as well as the synthesis of specific organic substances for pharmaceutical use or for food industry.Throughout R. baltica's life cycle, four CAZymes were found to be regulated. RB8895 is a sialidase, which is upregulated during exponential growth and downregulated in the stationary phase. Sialic acids are particularly abundant in animals in extracellular glycoproteins and glycolipids. When present in bacteria, sialic acids are found mostly in capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides (Angata and Varki, 2002). However, the key enzymes for sialic acid biosynthesis, N‐acetyl neuraminate synthase (NeuB, EC 2.5.1.56) and N‐acylneuraminate cytidyltransferase (NeuA, EC 2.7.7.43) are absent in the genome of R. baltica. In contrast, R. baltica possesses a complete pathway for sialic acid catabolism with seven family GH33 sialidases (including RB8895), an N‐acetylneuraminate lyase (RB3352, EC 4.1.3.3), which was found to be expressed on the proteome level (Gade et al., 2005c), and a N‐acetyl‐D‐glucosamine 2 epimerase (RB3348, EC 5.1.3.8). In absence of endogenous sialic acids, the role of RB8895 in the cell cycle is rather intriguing. The other three regulated genes encoding CAZymes (RB548, RB4894, RB5196) all belong to the family GH13, but have distinct activities. These enzymes are induced in the early or late stationary phase. RB5196 is highly similar to the amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea (52% sequence identity) (Büttcher et al., 1997). This enzyme is not a GH, but a transglycosidase which catalyses the synthesis of an alpha‐(1,4)‐linked glucan polymer from sucrose. Therefore an alpha‐(1,4) glucan is likely produced during the R. baltica cell cycle. Such a marine amylosucrase has exciting biotechnological potential, as it uses sucrose as sugar donor instead of an expensive activated sugar, such as ADP‐ or UDP‐glucose. RB548 and RB4894 are both related to glycogen metabolism, encoding a glycogen branching and debranching enzyme respectively. RB548 was shown to be active on the proteome level (Gade et al., 2005c). A systematic search of glycogen‐related enzymes (Ball and Morell, 2003) demonstrated that R. baltica possesses a complete glycogen metabolism (Dabin et al. in preparation). Therefore, it can be assumed that R. baltica makes use of its intracellular carbon storage (glycogen) in order to produce other polysaccharides or glycoconjugates, for example, to generate the holdfast substance. RB548 was also found to be expressed in proteome studies of cells grown on agar plates (Gade et al., 2005a).Given the limited functional knowledge on cellular processes in Planctomycetes, it was not surprising that a large number of genes found to be differentially expressed in this study encoded (conserved) hypothetical proteins. In order to get information on the potential function of those genes, we delineated groups of genes with similar expression patterns during culture growth. Information on the genes populating clusters, which comprise genes with possible functions in biotechnology, can be found in the Appendix S2. Table 3 shows the average expression pattern of the clusters, in which genes with potential biotechnological applications were found.We first focused on genes with unknown functions, which were co‐regulated with potentially biotechnologically relevant genes (Appendix S4). For example, cluster 16 (repression in stationary phase) contains genes upregulated in the stationary and late stationary phase, among them several sulfatases and genes involved in amino acid turn over, as well as almost 150 genes with unknown function. Cluster 3 (induction in late stationary phase) includes genes that play a potential role in the formation of the holdfast substance. So far, little is known about the holdfast substance of R. baltica and thus the 185 genes of unknown function could serve as a starting point to learn more about the organisms' ability to attach. Three sulfatases were also assigned to cluster 3 (induction in late stationary phase), emphasizing the proposal of an additional function which is connected with the cell structure formation.Interestingly, four of the nine polymerase‐associated genes in cluster 11 (repression in late stationary phase) were gathered together with 67 hypothetical proteins. The possibility that some of these genes have a similar function should be further investigated.Several genes involved in amino acid or sugar metabolism in cluster 20 (induced in late stationary phase) are co‐regulated with 103 hypothetical proteins. These hypothetical proteins may be candidates for the completion of the amino acid and sugar metabolism pathways of R. baltica. The co‐regulated hypothetical genes are hence prime targets to detect and confirm alternative ways of biochemical conversions in the laboratory.In this transcriptome study, gene regulation throughout the life cycle of R. baltica was examined in order to learn more about this model organism's behaviour as well as its regulation of genes with putative biotechnological application.This study documents transcriptomic changes concomitant with morphological changes during the exponential growth of an R. baltica culture. The lack of nutrients and a high cell density in the stationary phase imposes the activation of general stress response genes, genes for the reorganization of the genome and the cell wall, and possibly also for the formation of the holdfast substance. The results suggest that a subset of the 110 sulfatases may be involved in the formation of planctomycete‐specific morphological features (e.g. cell wall components or holdfast substance), rather than in the degradation of sulfated carbon compounds.Proteins of unknown function constitute a major part of the regulated genes in all growth stages of R. baltica. Their correlation to potential biotechnologically relevant genes, their expression at specific growth stages and their correspondence with certain morphotypes provide some preliminary insights into their function. In the future, next generation sequencing technologies will be applied to confirm the results presented here and to complement the data with information about regulatory RNA.Our results provide a substantial foundation for further studies on the transcriptomic and metabolomic elucidation of the unknown mechanisms behind the lifestyle, cell cycle and cell division of R. baltica. Furthermore, the insights they provide form a basis for more directed experiments.Cells of R. baltica were grown in batch cultures (500 ml) with mineral medium containing 10 mM glucose as sole carbon and 1 mM ammonium chloride as nitrogen source (Rabus et al., 2002). The R. baltica cultures were incubated at 28°C on a rotary shaker. Two independent batch cultures (biological replicates) per time point were inoculated and were treated separately over the whole experimental processes.Cultures were harvested independently by centrifugation (Beckman Coulter™ Avanti™ J‐20XP, JA10 Rotor, 20 min, 6000 r.p.m., 4°C), after different incubation times (44, 62, 82, 96 and 240 h) for expression profiling and microscopic analysis. The culture broth was collected in 500 ml of tubes and swirled briefly in an ethanol/dry ice bath to rapidly cool down the cultures and ‘freeze’ the RNA profile. Subsequently, the broth was centrifuged at 6000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4°C (Beckman Coulter™ Avanti™ J‐20XP, JA10 Rotor). The pellets were re‐suspended in 0.1 M Tris‐HCl and then re‐centrifuged to obtain cell pellets that were subsequently shock‐frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed as previously described (Wecker et al., 2009). For hybridization at least 2 µg of Alexa 547 dye‐labeled (PlatinumBright: Nucleic Acid Labelling Kit – 547 Red/Orange, Kreatech, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) and 2 µg of Alexa 647 dye‐labelled total cDNA (PlatinumBright: Nucleic Acid Labelling Kit – 647 Infrared, Kreatech, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) were combined and taken up in a final volume of 100 µl of DIG Easy Hyb hybridization solution (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). After the blocking step, the sample solution was applied to the arrays, denatured at 95°C for 3 min and hybridized under stringent conditions at 52°C for over 12 h. After hybridization, slides were washed at room temperature in ULTRArray Low Stringency Wash Buffer (Ambion, Austin, USA) and dried by N2.In two independent hybridizations cDNA samples were hybridized according to Fig. 1. Dots and arrowheads represent samples labelled with Alexa 547 and Alexa 647 respectively. The data shown are based on the analysis of the two technical and biological replicates performed for each of the conditions.For the microarrays a set of oligonucleotides corresponding to the whole genome of R. baltica SH 1T (Pirellula AROS Version 1.0) was purchased from Operon (Cologne, Germany) and diluted to 20 µm concentration in Micro Spotting Solution Plus spotting buffer (Telechem Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Spotting was done in three replicates onto GAPS II aminosilane slides (Corning, Schiphol‐Rijk, the Netherlands) using a SpotArray 24 spotting device (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). Post‐processing and blocking of the slides were done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blocking, hybridization and washing were carried out in an automated hybridization station HS400 (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). A more detailed description of the array can be found at the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO, 2009) under accession Platform number {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GPL7654"",""term_id"":""7654""}}GPL7654 and in Wecker and colleagues (2009).Slides were scanned at a resolution of 5 µm using a ScanArray Express Microarray scanner (Perkin Elmer). The image analysis software provided with this scanner was used for automatic spot detection and signal quantification. Raw data were automatically processed using the microarray data analysis software tool MADA (MADA, 2010). Series of probe replicates were tested for outliers using the outlier test implemented in MADA. First of all, only signals were considered as positive if mean spot pixel intensity was higher than local mean background pixel intensity plus twice the standard deviation of the local background. Only those spot signals were further processed, for which all three replicates, which are present for each gene on the whole genome microarray, were considered as a valid, positive signal. An outlier test was performed for the three replicates. In this procedure, the standard deviation for all replicates is calculated. Next, one of the replicates is left out and the standard deviation is computed once more. In case the newly calculated standard deviation differs more than 50% from the former one, the replicate is flagged as an outlier and removed from the data set. This procedure is rerun for all replicates. Subsequently, the mean of the remaining replicates is computed. Expression is described through the ratio (R) and intensity (I), where R is the fluorescence log ratio of one experimental time point over the other [e.g. R = log2 (result of channel for sample 44 h/result of channel for sample 62 h)] and I is the log mean fluorescence intensity [e.g. I = log10 (result of channel 44 h × result of channel 62 h)].LOWESS normalization was applied on an R‐versus‐I plot with a smoothing factor of 0.5. The expression data (ratio) of all hybridizations (array replicates) were averaged and combined to one expression data point (ratio).An expression ratio greater than 1.5 or less than −1.5 was used as a threshold for significant changes. The threshold was determined in a self‐self‐hybridization experiment. Reference sample material was labelled with both dyes and hybridized onto the same array. All steps were carried out as described above. The resulting signals were analysed and the log ratio was calculated. In theory, all log ratios should be zero in this experimental set up. However, due to noise the log ratios usually differ from zero. The cut‐off was determined in an R‐versus‐I plot (data not shown).All genes of the genome and their gene expression values were clustered using the k‐means clustering approach [Euclidean distance metric, k = 25 clusters and nine iterations (max. 500)] with the software tool Multi‐experiment Viewer MeV Version 4.0.2 from the TM4 microarray software suite (Saeed et al., 2003). The genome of R. baltica was automatically re‐annotated based on updated homology searches [June 2005 – MicHanThi (Quast, 2006)]. The updated annotation including all tool results are publicly available (Quast, 2009). JCoast (Richter et al., 2008) was used as a tool for the visualization, interpretation, statistic (COG‐assignment) and comparison of genomic data stored in GenDB V2.2 (Meyer et al., 2003). Venn diagrams were generated by BioVenn (Hulsen et al., 2008).A detailed description of the expression data is available from the GEO database under the accession Series number {""type"":""entrez-geo"",""attrs"":{""text"":""GSE19405"",""term_id"":""19405""}}GSE19405.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.We would like to thank Andreas Ellrott for excellent support concerning the microarray technology and Sebastian Rokitta for excellent technical assistance.

PMC4313881,Cellulases: ambiguous non-homologous enzymes in a genomic perspective,False,"The key material for bioethanol production is cellulose, one of the main components of the plant cell wall. Enzymatic depolymerization of cellulose, an essential step in bioethanol production, can be accomplished by fungal and bacterial cellulases. Most of the biochemically characterized bacterial cellulases come from only a few of cellulose degrading bacteria thus limiting our knowledge of a range of cellulolytic activities that exist in nature. The recent explosion of genomic data offers a unique opportunity to search for novel cellulolytic activities; however, the absence of clear understanding of structural and functional features that are important for reliable computational identification of cellulases precludes their exploration in the genomic datasets. Here we explore the diversity of cellulases and propose a genomic approach to overcome this bottleneck.The dramatic rate of fossil fuels depletion and the resulting global economic and environmental consequences have spurred the search for alternative renewable energy sources such as biofuels. One of the promising materials for biofuel production is plant biomass [1], which contains large amounts of the sugar polymers cellulose (a polymer of β-1,4 linked glucose) and hemicelluloses (polymers composed of xylose, mannose, galactose, rhamnose, arabinose and other sugars [2]. These can be broken down by a mixture of enzymes into simple sugars that are fermentable to produce ethanol [3]. Although cellulose is largely present as crystalline fibers that are highly recalcitrant to hydrolysis, its biomass content is typically larger than that of hemicellulose [3] and consequently, cellulases are the key enzymes for bioethanol production. Individual cellulose polymers form rigid microfiber structures stabilized by inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between glucose residues in the fibers, which significantly contributes to its recalcitrance [4]. This network of bonds leads to a mostly uniform arrangement of fibers and the resulting crystalline cellulose lacks enzyme-accessible surface morphologies, further enhancing recalcitrance to hydrolysis [5].All cellulases are glycoside hydrolase (GH) enzymes that utilize the same catalytic mechanism of acid-base catalysis with inversion or retention of glucose anomeric configuration [6]. There are two common types of the cellulase active sites. Glycoside hydrolyses with open (groove, cleft) active sites typically exhibit endocellulolytic activity (endocellulases), binding anywhere along the length of the cellulose molecule and hydrolyzing the β-1,4 glycosidic linkage, while those with tunnel-like active site exhibit exocellulolytic activity (cellobiohydrolases), binding at the ends of the cellulose molecule [7] and producing unit-length oligosaccharide products. Typically, exocellulases are processive enzymes, i.e. they are attached to the cellulose chain until it is completely hydrolyzed [7, 8], while endocellualses can be both processive and non-processive [7]. Efficiency of processive cellulases may greatly contribute to the rate-limiting step of cellulose hydrolysis [8]. Cellualses with endo- mode of action appear to be represented by a larger number of protein folds (Table 1). This indicates that endocellulases are either more evolutionary diverse or many novel exocellulases are yet to be found [9]. Many cellulases are multi-domain proteins and in addition to the catalytic domain have accessory domains such as carbohydrate binding modules (CBM) connected by a flexible linker [10]. The main role of CBM is to help cellulases bind cellulose, although it may also participate in initial disruption of cellulose fibers [11]. Cellulases preferentially bind to the amorphous or somewhat disordered (e.g. through acid pre-treatment) regions on the surface of the crystalline cellulose fiber [12]. Endocellulases (sometimes along with CBMs) help to disrupt the cellulose fibers and create accessible ends, while cellobiohydrolases continue the degradation by removing di- and oligosaccharides (usually 2–4 residues) from the ends of the disrupted cellulose fibers [13].Examples of cellulases with endo- and exo- mode of actionSeveral biochemical methods are commonly used to determine the substrate-specificity of cellulases and the endo-/exo- mode of action. The reducing sugar assays involve incubating purified enzyme with cellulose-containing substrates along with a binding reagent (i.e. dinitrosalicylic acid), which reacts with glucose, released during the incubation, to create fluorescent compounds, which are then detected spectrophotometrically [14]. In the halo assay, a gene coding for a putative cellulase is introduced into a non-cellulolytic microorganism, such as Escherichia coli, which is then grown on cellulose substrates stained with Congo Red. Colonies carrying cellulase genes are screened by formation of halo plaques resulting from degradation of the stained cellulose by the bacterial colony [15]. Viscosimetry and thin layer chromatography (TLC) assays are commonly used to determine exo- versus endo- mode of action, for example, exocellulases reduce viscosisty of solution of CMC much slower than endocellualses, while running incubation products of a cellulase on a gel will show whether shorter, such as glucose, cellobiose (exo- mode of action) or longer oligosaccharides, such as cellotriose, cellotetraose (endo- mode of action) are present [16, 17].Adding to the challenge of biochemical characterization of cellulases is the multi-substrate specificity. Many of the biochemically confirmed cellulases are active on variety of substrates in addition to cellulose, such as xylan, lichenan, mannan. For example, cellulase Cel5E from Pseudomonas fluorescens was active on caboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), lichenan, Avicel (or microcrystalline cellulose) and ASC (acid-swollen cellulose) but completely inactive on xylan [18]. Cellulase CelG form Fibrobacter succinogenes belongs to the same GH family 5 but showed high activity on CMC and xylan and was completely inactive on Avicel and lichenan [19]. By contrast, some cellulases are active only on cellulose derivatives. For example, a GH family 5 cellulase cel5B from Termobifida fusca is able to degrade only cellulose-containing substrates (CMC, Avicel and MN300 (native fibrous cellulose), but is completely inactive on other substrates [20]. The vast majority of researchers use CMC degradation as indication of the cellulolytic activity. Therefore, here we consider documented CMC hydrolysis as the minimum requirement for an enzyme to be annotated as a biochemically confirmed cellulase. The multi-substrate specificity of cellulases and the persistent lack of data about activity on substrates other than CMC emphasize the need for adoption of a universal methodology for cellulase validation and characterization (Box 1).Lack of standardization in the use of certain assays and substrates for experimental cellulase determination:Devise a standard assay or a set of assays for unambiguous and reliable identification of cellulasesPoor taxonomic representation among experimentally studied organisms:Obtain genome sequences and biochemically characterize potential cellulases from taxonomically diverse organismsCellulases are found in 12 unrelated protein familiesDevelop a natural classification system for each cellulase-containing protein familyThere are multiple substrate specificities other than cellulose in each of the cellulase-containing families. There are no known genomic markers for cellulases. Current models for genomic identification of cellulases are not specific:Identify class-specific genomic markers for cellulasesDevelop sensitive, cellulase-specific modelsValidate models via iterative experiment-computation approachBacteria that are either known to be or potentially could be cellulolytic are widely distributed in nature. However, the best studied cellulose-degraders, such as Clostridium thermocellum, Clostridium cellulolyticum, Caldicellulosiruptor bescii (previously known as Anaerocellum thermophilum) belong to the same phylum, Firmicutes. Despite numerous studies of microbial cellulolytic apparatus [21–24], only about 20 genomes of known cellulose degraders have been fully sequenced so far. Recent genomic studies have identified many bacteria that contain arrays of various glycosyl hydrolases (many of which could be cellulases [21, 22]). Therefore it is likely that only a small fraction of the cellulolytic world has been annotated and studied to date and more experimental and genomic investigation of potential cellulase degraders from diverse taxa and habitats is needed.The CAZy (Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes) database provides classification of enzymes (e.g. glycoside hydrolases, glycosyl transferases) and substrate-binding modules involved in various types of carbohydrate metabolism based on sequence comparison. All known cellulases are found within twelve GH families of the CAZy database and can be described with two enzyme commission numbers: EC 3.2.1.4 (endoglucanase) and EC 3.2.1.91 (cellobiohydorlase). Families GH5 and GH9 appear to have the largest number of biochemically characterized cellulases. This could be partly due to the fact that cellulases from these families are abundant in the model cellulolytic bacteria. Yet, many enzymes that effectively hydrolyse cellulose belong to other, smaller CAZy families, for example the Cel12A cellulase from Rhodothermus marinus (GH12) [25], endoglucanase F from F. succinogenes S85 (GH51) [26], and CbhI from Fusicoccum sp. (GH7) [27]. This indicates that the search for potential efficient cellulases should be substantially broadened.Although the collection of the carbohydrate enzyme data in CAZy provides a very useful resource for enzymologists, annotations could be significantly improved. For example, the term ‘characterized’ in CAZy is applied equally to proteins that have been characterized biochemically and to those for which the functions have been predicted computationally. As we show, computational predictions for cellulases are currently unreliable; therefore knowing the source of information for annotation would be helpful. Nevertheless, CAZy provides a much needed connection between enzymology and genomics and can be considerably enhanced with improved computational models.In order to search for cellulases in the ever increasing genomic and metagenomic data reliable sequence-based methods for their identification must be available. Current computational methodologies require that proteins should be conserved enough in sequence to carry out full-length sequence similarity searches (e.g. BLAST) or they should have specific markers, such as distinctive protein domains and domain combinations, motifs, accessory proteins, etc (see [28] for details) to yield reliable predictions. To illustrate the problems of genomic identification of cellulases, we compare their relevant features to those of another common enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism, hexokinase (the first enzyme of the glycolysis pathway). BLAST searches with a hexokinase seem quite reliable, whereas those with confirmed cellulases produce much more ambiguous results, where similar sequences could be annotated with a variety of definitions other than cellulase. Automated annotation of new genomes depends heavily on the identification of similar proteins by BLAST, so this ambiguity greatly complicates identification of potential novel cellulases.From a structural perspective, hexokinases belong to a single protein fold (Figure 1). All proteins that catalyze the ATP-dependent conversion of aldo- and keto-hexose sugars to the hexose-6-phosphate [29] have the same Ribonuclease H-like motif fold and belong to the same protein family ‘hexokinase’. On the other hand, proteins that catalyze the hydrolysis of the β-1,4 glucoside bond using the same mechanism of acid-base catalysis (cellulases) belong to at least 8 unrelated protein folds (Fig. 1) further differentiating into even more protein families [30]. For example, cellulase Cel5E from P. fluorescens has an (β/α)8 fold and belongs to GH family 5 [18] (family classification according to the CAZy database [30]), cellulase Egl-257 from Bacillus circulans has an (α/α)6 barrel fold and belongs to GH family 8 [31], cellulase cel44a from C. thermocellum has TIM-like barrel and β-sandwich domain fold and belongs to GH family 44 [32]. Recent biochemical and genomics studies identified cellulases in 11 or 13 CAZy families [9, 30, 33]. Cellulases therefore are representatives of a large class of non-homologous isofunctional enzymes [34], i.e. proteins catalyzing the same biochemical reaction that have evolved independently and are unrelated in sequence and structure. Therefore, in contrast to hexokinase, cellulases from each protein family must be treated as independent cases in any type of genomic analysis. This is a potential problem, which is easily solvable although it dramatically increases the amount of data analysis.Hexokinase and cellulases: structural conservation and diversity. Corresponding CAZy families are listed below structures. (images are taken from the RCSB PDB (www.pdb.org). The following labels correspond to PDB accession numbers: ‘Hexokinase’ - 1ig8[43]; ‘GH5, GH44, GH51’ - 1e5j[44]; ‘GH6’ - 2boe[45]; ‘GH7, GH12’ - 2jen[46]; ‘GH8, GH9, GH48’ - 1ia6[47]; ‘GH23’ – 2xqo[33]; ‘GH45’ - 4eng[48]; ‘GH61’ - 2vtc[49]; ‘GH74’ - 2cn2[50].In addition to pairwise sequence similarity searches, the second powerful tool used in automated annotation is protein domain architecture identified using domain specific profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). HMMs are built from multiple sequence alignments and represent probabilities of certain amino acids to be located at certain position in a domain. Again, hexokinases can be easily distinguished from other enzymes based on their domain architecture (Figure 2). Nearly all hexokinases display a conserved combination of two protein domains termed “hexokinase_1” (Pfam accession PF00349) in the N-terminus and “hexokinase_2” (PF03727) in the C-terminus. Detection of these domains in any protein sequence unambiguously identifies it as a hexokinase. There is essentially no diversity in the domain architecture of hexokinases: less than 10% of sequences exhibit a duplicated version of the dual domain protein (Figure 2) and less than 1% contain other unrelated domains.Hexokinase and cellulases: conservation and diversity of domain architectures. Accession numbers for sequences are shown.By contrast, identification of cellulases by domain architecture is problematic due to two characteristics. First, cellulases display an extremely wide diversity of domain architectures even within the same protein family (Figure 2). Second, and more critical, the HMMs currently available to recognize cellulases are built from multiple alignments that include both cellulases and similar in sequence non-cellulases and thus are not able to differentiate between members of the same protein family that have different substrate specificities. To illustrate this problem, we compare known activities of enzymes that belong to GH5 family (Pfam PF00150, Cellulase) to that of GH19 family (Pfam 00182, Glyco_hydro_19). GH19 is a large family (more than 1000 sequences in current databases) in which all 165 experimentally studied enzymes exhibit a single activity - chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14). GH5 family is comparable in size (just over 2000 sequences), however, among 373 experimentally studied enzymes from this family, at least 12 different activities other than cellulase have been reported (data from the CAZy database). Therefore, datasets retrieved with the current Cellulase domain model [35] may contain primarily non-cellulases and therefore would not be helpful to experimentalists.Metagenomic exploration of environments where lignocellulose is being effectively decomposed is the most promising path toward the discovery of novel cellulases. Recent advances in metagenomics resulted in generating genomic datasets from diverse environments, including fresh-water [36], the ocean [37], guts of insects [38], ruminants [39] and even the human intestine [40]. Such datasets have a tremendous potential to reveal novel cellulolytic capabilities. For example, the recent metagenomic study of a cow rumen has uncovered tens of thousands of putative cellulases [41] thus truly becoming a gold mine for their future exploration. However, the very same computational problems that we have outlined above prevented unambiguous identification of true cellulases in this dataset; investigators had to narrow down their list of targets for experimental validation randomly and the reported success rate was around 50% [41]. Clearly, a more efficient and cost effective method of mining is urgently needed.Natural classification systems based on evolutionary relationships between sequences are instrumental in dealing with complex biological systems [28]. Because cellulases are found in protein families with different evolutionary histories and belong to different protein folds, the evolutionary path of each cellulase-containing protein family must be evaluated independently. To build a natural classification system for cellulases, classes must be defined using a phylogenomic approach, where related sequences of enzymatic domains are collected, properly aligned using available structural information and then clustered (e.g. via phylogenetic tree construction). Independent genomic markers, such as specific combinations of enzymatic and accessory domains, genome neighborhoods, etc, must be then identified for each individual class. In order to link biochemical activities to genomically identified classes, all available information on substrate-specificity of individual sequences must be mapped onto individual classes.An effective natural classification scheme will assist in searching for novel cellulolytic activities in genomic datasets by identifying markers for that can be used to differentiate cellulases from related enzymes with different substrate specificity. While it is difficult to discern a pattern of accessory domains when looking at all sequences of a given GH family, focusing on a class of related proteins within a family may reveal specific accessory domains associated with that class. Most of the biochemically confirmed cellulases have carbohydrate-binding module domains (Figure 2), and cellulases with the same catalytic domains tend to more efficiently degrade recalcitrant crystalline cellulose in case if they contain a larger number of CBMs [27, 42]. Thus, identifying CBMs that are class-specific should be productive for better classification of the catalytic domains. Similarly, analysis of genome neighborhoods may reveal certain types of genes consistently found in proximity to genes encoding biochemically confirmed cellulases. Then the presence of these genes in proximity to genes encoding unknown GHs would suggest that it can be a cellulase (a guilty-by-association approach). Lastly, analysis of the aligned sequences can identify class-specific patterns of conserved amino acids, whose potential role in substrate specificity could be revealed by mapping onto available 3D structures and homology models. Aligned sequences of specific classes can also be turned into specific and sensitive domain models (e.g. HMM) for each of the catalytic domains or, where appropriate, for their combinations with auxiliary domains. Such models will become an essential tool, to search specifically for cellulases in ever-increasing genomic and metagenomic datasets. With new, refined models it should be possible to reduce the search space for cellulases by orders of magnitude and to provide experimentalists with a short list of enzymes that are more likely to be a true cellulase. Newly developed cellulase-specific models should be deposited to relevant databases (Pfam, CAZy) to ensure their availability to the scientific community.The need for specific cellulase models is pressing. We now have hundreds of environmental sequencing samples that contain more than 1 billion sequences including datasets from such “cellulolytic” environments as termite gut [38] and cow rumen [41]. Together with still largely unexplored complete genomes of cellulose-degraders, metagenomic data creates a great reservoir for finding novel cellulolytic activities. There is also a need for a much closer collaboration between experimentalists and computational scientists in this area. The existing biochemical characterization has been performed on a small subset of closely related organisms; therefore a substantial number of experiments will be needed to fill gaps on substrate-specificity within newly identified classes of cellulase-containing families. Better standardization of cellulase assays and more thorough assessment of activity on a variety of carbohydrate polymers will greatly improve our ability to link sequence classes to enzyme activities (Box 1).In conclusion, we would like to point out several contentious areas in practical biotechnology that might be addressed using computational genomics in the near future. First, there is a clear difference between enzymes in their ability to hydrolyze cellulose substrates, such as non-treated, raw and pre-treated plant material (e.g. switchgrass, wood pulp). Such differences could be due to inherent enzymatic domain properties (e.g. Kcat, product release) or associations with accessory domains that enhance substrate binding (e.g. CBM). Thus, one of the targets for computational studies would be associating the experimentally determined characteristics of various cellulases with both catalytic site conservation and the accessory domain architecture. The more enzymes with known sequence, structure and biochemical activities are available, the more powerful associations and therefore predictions could be made. The resulting data would be applicable to enzyme engineering as well to searches for better catalysts within a reduced sequence and structure space.Second, many challenges are posed by the engineering of cellulases to be robust under harsh industrial settings (e.g. temperature, solvents, ionic conditions). Hence, better understanding the cellulase active site and enzymatic functions at the sequence level could enable protein engineering that would maintain catalytic properties while enhancing protein robustness.Finally, a better communication between leading world cellulase researchers must be established in effort of standardization of both experimental and computational approaches to studies of cellulases. One way of accomplishing this goal would be creation of a freely available Internet resource that would include internationally accepted methodologies for biochemical and computational cellulase studies and a curated and updatable database of confirmed cellulases. To improve accessibility of such a resource, we recommend merging it with already existing web-resources, such as the CAZy database mentioned above.The BioEnergy Science Center (BESC) is a U.S. Department of Energy Bioenergy Research Center supported by the Office of Biological and Environmental Research in the DOE Office of Science.

PMC4561533,Thermostable Enzymes as Biocatalysts in the Biofuel Industry,False,"Lignocellulose is the most abundant carbohydrate source in nature and represents an ideal renewable energy source. Thermostable enzymes that hydrolyze lignocellulose to its component sugars have significant advantages for improving the conversion rate of biomass over their mesophilic counterparts. We review here the recent literature on the development and use of thermostable enzymes for the depolymerization of lignocellulosic feedstocks for biofuel production. Furthermore, we discuss the protein structure, mechanisms of thermostability, and specific strategies that can be used to improve the thermal stability of lignocellulosic biocatalysts.With the increase in global energy consumption and expected impending shortages of crude oil, there is a considerable and immediate interest in developing alternative energy sources. Plants harness solar energy at the earth’s surface to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide and collectively recycle an estimated 1011 tons of carbon annually (Brett and Waldren, 1996). This carbon is utilized in the formation of complex carbohydrates via photosynthesis. Lignocellulose is the most abundant carbohydrate source in plants and has significant potential for conversion into liquid fuels or biofuels. Biofuels provide a means to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels as well as to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases into the environment. This is because, unlike fossil fuels, biofuels are renewable over more useful time frames. Further, biofuels such as ethanol have higher octane ratings and combust in a cleaner and more efficient manner than gasoline, meaning their atmospheric carbon footprint is inherently low (Demain et al., 2005; Lynd et al., 1991). Consequently, biofuels have the additional potential to reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.First-generation biofuels have already resulted in reduced vehicular emissions of greenhouse gases (Hill et al., 2006). However, the production of first-generation biofuels, which are based on the fermentation of corn starch or cane sugar, are neither economically nor ecologically sustainable, as corn and cane require large areas of land for their cultivation and compete with food crops meant for human consumption. Second-generation fuels that utilize lignocellulose, a recalcitrant, but more abundant part of plant material, are therefore more desirable to tackle the looming environmental and social crisis (Tollefson, 2008). The potential energy inherent in plant biomass far exceeds present human usage (Demain et al., 2005). Cellulosic feedstocks already available from agriculture and other sources are estimated to be approximately a billion tons per year in the USA alone (Corr and Hettenhaus, 2009). Many plants that produce large proportions of lignocellulosic material are capable of growth on less desirable land and require less maintenance (Tollefson, 2008). This means crops available for the production of second-generation biofuels may easily be expanded with little impact. Collectively these factors make second-generation biofuels a cost-effective, plentiful, and renewable energy resource. Accordingly, methods for optimizing the deconstruction of plant cell wall polysaccharides into their component sugars for production of biofuels have garnered considerable attention worldwide.Lignocellulose consists primarily of three major polymers: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose accounts for up to 40% of plant biomass and consequently is the most abundant natural polymer on earth. It comprises a linear polymer of glucopyranose molecules linked by β-1–4 glycosidic linkages that have alternating orientations. Cellulose microfibrils form interstrand hydrogen bonds, which along with van der Waals forces result in a highly crystalline structure. This crystalline form limits enzyme accessibility and, therefore, limits the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. Cellulose hydrolysis is further limited by the intimate associations between cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin (Brett and Waldren, 1996; Cosgrove, 2005; Popper and Fry, 2008; Vignon et al., 2004; Zykwinska et al., 2007a,b), which further reduces the accessibility of cellulase enzymes to the cellulose fibers. The hemicellulose fraction of lignocellulose represents a significant source of mostly pentose sugars that are potentially important value-added products for fermentation to biofuels. Indeed, there is an increasing focus on engineering pentose utilization, and even xylan and cellulose saccharification, pathways into ethanologenic microorganisms such as yeast, allowing these organisms to ferment multiple monosaccharide products (Pasha et al., 2007; Ryabova et al., 2003; Voronovsky et al., 2009).Enzymatic release of monosaccharides from cellulose and hemicellulose is mediated by glycoside hydrolases. Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are a large class of enzymes that exhibit both broad and stringent substrate specificities. GH enzymes selectively catalyze reactions that produce smaller carbohydrate units from polysaccharides (Kobata, 2001). These enzymes are exquisite catalysts that accelerate the rate of hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages by up to 17 orders of magnitude over the uncatalyzed hydrolysis (Wolfenden et al., 1998). They are applied as biocatalysts in the hydrolysis of natural polysaccharides to mono- and oligosaccharides. GHs are classified into different families based on their amino acid sequences and three-dimensional folds (Cantarel et al., 2009). At present, this system comprises 115 families that have been organized into 14 different clans (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/). GHs, even within the same genome, typically exhibit a diverse array of multimodular configurations. Polypeptides associated with plant cell wall hydrolysis commonly harbor a catalytic GH domain and a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). CBMs are small domains with affinity for specific carbohydrate linkages and consequently act to target the catalytic portion of the enzyme to its cognate substrate (see Shoseyov et al., 2006 for a pertinent review). Despite the enormous variety and remarkable structural diversity of GH enzymes, as exhibited through analyses of their three-dimensional structures, all GHs, except for those in GH family 4 (Yip and Withers, 2006), hydrolyze glycosidic linkages by either a single displacement (inversion), or a double displacement (retention) of stereo-chemical configuration at the anomeric carbon (C1) center (Dodd and Cann, 2009), the mechanism being uniform within a GH family (Davies and Henrissat, 1995).Enzymes that catalyze the depolymerization of cellulose are broadly classified as cellulases. However, complete and efficient hydrolysis of cellulose requires the cooperative action of at least three cellulolytic enzyme activities, namely endoglucanase (1,4-β-d-glucan glucohydrolase [EC 3.2.1.4]), exoglucanase (1,4-β-d-glucan cellobiohydrolase [EC 3.2.1.91]), and β-glucosidase (β-d-glucoside glucohydrolase, [EC3.2.1.21]). By contrast, complete enzymatic hydrolysis of hemicellulose requires the action of a larger repertoire of enzymes due to a broader diversity in chemical linkages inherent in these heteropolymers. These enzymes include endo-β-1,4-xylanases ([EC 3.2.1.8]), xylan 1,4-β-xylosidases ([EC 3.2.1.37]), α-l-arabinofur-anosidases ([EC 3.2.1.55]), α-glucuronidases ([EC 3.2.1.139]), acetylxylan esterases ([EC 3.1.1.72]), feruloyl esterases ([EC 3.1.1.73]), mannan endo-1,4-β-mannanases ([EC 3.2.1.78]), β-1,4-mannosidases ([EC 3.2.1.25]), and arabinan endo-1,5-α-l-arabinosidases ([EC 3.2.1.99]).Current efforts to improve depolymerization of lignocellulose or search for new biocatalysts (bioprospecting) employ a multifaceted approach. The strategy includes a search for novel enzymes with high specific activities and relatively low levels of end-product inhibition. In order to be useful on an industrial scale, care is being afforded to other characteristics including thermal stability and tolerance of solutions that vary in pH, organic solvents, chemical and oxidative reagents, and detergent composition.In the optimization of biorefinery-scale lignocellulose deconstruction, thermostable enzymes (enzymes that maintain structural integrity above 55 °C) possess a number of important advantages over their mesophilic counterparts: (1) these enzymes typically have a higher specific activity and higher stability, allowing for extended hydrolysis times and decreasing the amount of enzyme needed for saccharification (Shao and Wiegel, 1995, Viikari et al., 2007); (2) these enzymes are more compatible with nonenzymatic processes designed to decrease the crystallinity of cellulose (Szijarto et al., 2008); (3) the costs associated with process cooling are decreased or eliminated allowing the volatilization of products such as ethanol to be streamlined (Viikari et al., 2007); (4) mass transport costs are decreased due to decreased fluid viscosity; (5) there is an increased flexibility for biorefinery process configurations (Stutzenberger, 1990); (6) microbial contamination risks are significantly reduced; and finally (7) these enzymes can typically be stored at room temperature without inactivation of activity. These advantages are significant because approximately one-half of the projected process costs in biomass conversions are estimated to be associated with enzyme production, and all these benefits attributed to thermostable enzymes will result in an improvement to the overall economy of the process (Haki and Rakshit, 2003).Various bacteria, archaea, and fungi have received considerable attention as potential sources for thermostable cellulosic enzymes. The breadth of thermophilic microbes with enzymatic characteristics amenable to lignocellulose deconstruction has been reviewed recently (Blumer-Schuette et al., 2008); however, thermostable enzymes are produced both by thermophilic and mesophilic microorganisms. Additionally, the former review largely neglects fungi, which are a valuable source of thermostable enzymes active on lignocellulose. Further, this is a rapidly evolving area that warrants a comprehensive update. The structural and functional characteristics of thermostable enzymes isolated from both mesophilic and thermophilic organisms, including fungi, and their application to improving lignocellulose hydrolysis for the production of second-generation biofuels is the subject of this review. Furthermore, we will evaluate the advantages, and current knowledge regarding the mechanisms, of thermostability. Finally, we will discuss the methods being employed for improving thermostability.Cellulose-degrading enzymes are widespread in nature and are predominantly produced by microorganisms such as bacteria, archaea, and fungi that harvest energy from decaying plant matter. Efficient cellulose hydrolysis requires the concerted action of three different classes of enzymes, including endoglucanases and exoglucanases, which operate at the solid: liquid interface and β-glucosidases which operate on the soluble degradation products of cellulose. The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose by the various cellulase enzymes is diagrammed in Fig. 1.1. Endoglucanases randomly hydrolyze internal glycosidic linkages, resulting in a rapid decrease in polymer length and a gradual increase in the number of liberated reducing ends (Sun and Cheng, 2002). Exoglucanases hydrolyze cellulose chains by removing mostly cellobiose from either the reducing or nonreducing ends, resulting in a rapid release of reducing ends but a less dramatic change in overall polymer chain length (Percival Zhang et al., 2006). Cellobiose, the repeating structural unit that makes up the cellulose chain, comprises two β-1,4-linked glucose molecules. Extraction of glucose from cellobiose is primarily achieved through the action of β-glucosidases. These enzymes may also act on cellodextrins and larger cello-oligosaccharides, in which case they are commonly named cellodextrinases (Qi et al., 2008). β-Glucosidase activity is critical for the efficient hydrolysis of cellulose because end-product inhibition of endo- and exo-glucanases by cellobiose can represent a significant limitation to cellulose hydrolysis (Shen et al., 2008).Enzymatic activities associated with cellulose deconstruction. Endoglucanase enzymes (indicated by red arrows) randomly cleave β-1,4 glucosidic linkages within the backbone of cellulose. Cellobiohydrolase enzymes (also known as exoglucanases) cleave cellobiose from either the reducing end or the nonreducing end of cellulose chains in a processive manner. Oligosaccharides released as a result of these activities are converted to glucose by the action of cellodextrinases, whereas the cellobiose released mainly by the action of cellobiohydrolases is converted to glucose by β-glucosidases.β-1,4-Exoglucanases or cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) are of significant importance to cellulolytic systems, facilitating the production of mostly cellobiose which can readily be converted to glucose by β-glucosidases. These enzymes largely derive from the GH families 6, 7, 9, and 48, although several examples are also seen in GH family 5 (Table 1.1). CBHs attach to the ends of cellulose microfibrils and then processively slide down the strands cleaving off cellobiose as they progress. The processive nature of CBHs is mediated by tunnel-like active sites, which can only accept a substrate chain via its terminal regions (Fig. 1.2). These exo-acting CBH enzymes function by threading the cellulose chain through the tunnel, removing cellobiose units in a sequential manner.Crystal structure of Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolase (CBHI) in complex with cellohexaose (PDB accession no. 7CEL; Divne et al., 1998). A prominent active site tunnel 50 Å in length accommodates the cellulose chain. For CBHI, cellobiose units are cleaved from the reducing end as the enzyme processively slides down the cellulose chain from the reducing end toward the nonreducing end. The structural representation of CBHI was generated with the UCSF Chimera software package.Characteristics of major GH familiesMany CBHs have been characterized from bacteria of the genus Clostridium. In fact, most thermostable CBHs derive from cellulosomal complexes produced by members of this genus. C. thermocellum, in particular, appears to be a significant resource for CBHs with up to four GH family 5, 15 GH family 9, and four GH family 48 CBHs having been described. Clostridial CBHs typically have optimal activity at temperatures ranging from 60 to 75 °C and pH 5.0 to 6.5 (see Table 1.2 for a complete list of thermostable CBHs). To date, the most thermostable CBH has been isolated from the culture supernatant of the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga sp. strain FjSS3-B1. The enzyme has maximal activity at 105 °C and maintains a half-life of 70 min at 108 °C (Ruttersmith and Daniel, 1991). The Thermotoga sp. CBH is active on amorphous cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with cellobiose as the sole product. However, the enzyme exhibits limited activity against filter paper or Sigmacell 20, highlighting the need for this enzyme to work synergistically with an endoglucanase enzyme exhibiting activity on the crystalline substrate. Other examples exist where this need is less evident. For example, a GH family 5 CBH, CelO, from C. thermocellum shows a marked preference for crystalline substrate, yet maintains activity on cellodextrins, barley β-glucan, and CMC (Zverlov et al., 2002). An exoglucanase from C. stercorarium, in particular, shows significant biotechnological potential as it is able to maintain a linear rate of hydrolysis on Avicel, a highly crystalline substrate, for three days at 70 °C (Bronnenmeier et al., 1991).Thermostable exoglucanasesFor biotechnological applications, enzymes exhibiting broad substrate specificity are desirable. In this regard, two CBHs have been isolated from C. thermocellum that were found to cleave lichenan, xylan, and para-nitrophenyl derivatives of cellobiose and lactopyranose in addition to CMC (Tuka et al., 1990).Thermostable CBHs also occur widely in fungi, such as Thermoascus aurantiacus, Talaromyces emersonii, and Cladosporium spp. Fungal CBHs are typically composed of a catalytic domain connected to a CBM by a flexible pro/ser/thr-rich peptide linker. A recent comparison of several family 7 GHs found Cel7A from C. thermophilum exhibit as much as 11-fold higher specific activity than the others tested on soluble substrates and significantly greater activity on Avicel and phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC; Voutilainen et al., 2008).GH family 5 and 7 enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds with retention of configuration, while GH families 6, 9, and 48 employ an inverting mechanism for hydrolysis (Khademi et al., 2002; Rouvinen et al., 1990). GH family 6 and 7 enzymes hydrolyze cellulose specifically from the nonreducing and reducing ends of the polymeric chain, respectively (Boisset et al., 2000; Divne et al., 1998), while examples of CBHs active on either reducing or nonreducing ends have been reported for GH family 48 (Bronnenmeier et al., 1991; Irwin et al., 2000; Sanchez et al., 2003). The crystal structures of several thermostable GH 7 CBHs, have been solved, both in complex with unmodified substrates or in the uncomplexed form (Divne et al., 1998, 1994; Grassick et al., 2004; Munoz et al., 2001; Parkkinen et al., 2008; Stahlberg et al., 1996). The general structure consists of a β-sandwich, with loops extending from this structure to form an enclosed cellulose-binding tunnel. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of Cel7A (CBHI) from T. reesei have shown that there are three catalytic residues in the active site, where Glu212 acts as the nucleophile, Glu217 as a proton donor, and Asp214 is responsible for maintaining the correct positioning and protonation state of Glu212 through the hydrogen bond formed between Asp and Glu212 (Divne et al., 1998; Stahlberg et al., 1996). These catalytic residues occur in the long cellulose-binding tunnel, which can accommodate up to 10 glycosyl units (− 7 to +3 subsites), and are conserved in other family 7 GHs including a glycosylated version from T. emersonii (Grassick et al., 2004). The conformations and catalytic residues differ for enzymes from other families with GH family 5 enzymes forming a (β/α)8 structure and family 9 and 48 both forming an (α/α)6 structures (Parsiegla et al., 1998; Sakon et al., 1996). GH family 6 enzymes utilize two aspartate residues as the nucleophile and proton donor, while family 9 enzymes use an aspartate and a glutamate, respectively (Khademi et al., 2002, Wolfgang and Wilson, 1999).Endo-1,4-β-d-glucanases expedite the cellulolytic process, acting synergistically with CBHs. In the cellulolytic deconstruction of cellulose, endoglucanases attack the cellulose polymer in a random manner, disrupting the regular crystalline nature of the substrate. The CBHs may then bind to these amorphous regions and processively cleave cellobiose units. Endoglucanases are widespread among GH families, with examples described for families 5–9, 12, 44, 45, 48, 51, 61, and 74 (Table 1.1). The majority of thermostable endoglucanases belong to GH family 12, although thermostable endoglucanases belonging to families 5, 8, and 45 have also been reported (Ando et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2000; Park et al., 2001).Thermostable endoglucanases have been isolated from a number of thermophilic bacteria, and archaea as well as mesophilic and moderately thermophilic filamentous fungi. Recombinant versions of many of these endoglucanases have been heterologously expressed and characterized, and their enzymatic characteristics are summarized in Table 1.3. In addition to enzymes obtained from microbial sources, a thermostable family 45 endoglucanase has also been characterized from the mollusk, Mytilus edulis (blue mussel). This enzyme was able to retain enzymatic activity after being heated to 100 °C for 10 min (Xu et al., 2000).Thermostable endoglucanasesTo date several enzymes have been reported that display optimal enzymatic activity at, or above, 100 °C, with the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus, possessing a GH family 12 endoglucanase that maintains enzymatic integrity up to 112 °C. This endoglucanase has a signal peptide indicating that it may be exported from the cell and act extracellularly. The enzyme, however, lacks a CBM (Bauer et al., 1999), a feature apparently common to many thermostable cellulases including those described for GH family 7 endo- and exo-glucanases from the ascomycete fungus Melanocarpus albomyces (Haakana et al., 2004), and the GH family 8 endoglucanase of Aquifex aeolicus (Kim et al., 2000). The absence of a CBM is commonly associated with reduced hydrolytic activity on crystalline substrates (Szijarto et al., 2008).With respect to biotechnological applications, thermotolerance should be considered alongside the corresponding enzymatic half-life. Typically, the half-life of an enzyme will reduce dramatically as it is shifted beyond the temperature at which it exhibits maximal activity. For example the Thermotoga neapolitana endoglucanase, CelB, has a half-life of 130 min at its optimum temperature of 106 °C, yet this reduces to just 26 min at 110 °C (Bok et al., 1998). Although not an exclusive feature of the fungi, numerous glycosylated fungal endoglucanases exist, such as the GH7 family endoglucanase of T. aurantiacus. It has been proposed that glycosylation may enhance the thermostability of an enzyme, and consistently the removal of glycosyl-sugar chains has been shown to reduce thermostability (Hong et al., 2003). While a number of examples of fungal endoglucanases have been described, which retain relatively high activity at elevated temperatures, they have yet to match the thermostable attributes of bacterial endoglucanases with the most extreme fungal examples being two GH family 5 endoglucanases purified from T. aurantiacus (70–80 °C) and T. emersonii (80 °C; Gomes et al., 2000; Murray et al., 2001; Parry et al., 2002), although the endoglucanase of T. aurantiacus was able to retain some activity following incubation at 100 °C.The pH optima of thermostable endoglucanases vary, and examples of acidophilic and alkaliphilic ones have been reported. Extremes in all enzyme classes are typically more evident at the acidophilic side of the scale, for example a GH family 12 endoglucanase from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus exhibits a half-life of approximately 8 h at 80 °C and pH 1.8 (Huang et al., 2005), while the GH family 5 endoglucanase of T. aurantiacus that was able to retain activity following incubation at 100 °C, also maintains structural stability down to pH 2.8 (Murray et al., 2001). Consequently, considerable emphasis has been placed on identifying alkaliphilic enzymes to enable assembling of a set of enzymes that span the pH range used in a biotechnological pipeline.Several unusual, but potentially useful, activities have been reported for thermostable endoglucanases, including an enzyme from T. maritima that exhibits its own inherent exoglucanase activity (Chhabra et al., 2002), while an endoglucanase from S. solfataricus additionally exhibits endoxylanase activity (Maurelli et al., 2008).Three-dimensional structures have been solved for at least eight GH 12 family enzymes including a thermostable endoglucanase from the hyper-thermophile Rhodothermus marinus (Crennell et al., 2002). This family of enzymes assembles to form a β-jelly roll and, unlike family 8 and 45 enzymes, utilizes a retaining mechanism for catalysis. Site-directed muta-genesis of a GH family 12 endoglucanase from Hypocrea jecorina has shown that two glutamate residues (Glu116 and Glu200, respectively) (Okada et al., 2000), conserved through all GH family 12 enzymes, comprise the catalytic nucleophile and the proton donor. In GH family 8 and 45 enzymes, these residues comprise Asp/Glu and Asp/Asp, respectively (Collins et al., 2005; Yennawar et al., 2006).β-Glucosidase enzymes are responsible for the hydrolysis of β-glucosidic linkages in aryl-, amino-, or alkyl-β-d-glucosides, cyanogenic glucosides, and oligo- or disaccharides. In the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose, endoglucanases and CBHs are responsible for degrading cellulose to cellobiose, after which β-glucosidases hydrolyze cellobiose to free glucose molecules (Fig. 1.1). β-Glucosidases are generally a rate-limiting factor and are consequently responsible for the regulation of the entire cellulolytic process. This is due to the inhibitory effects typically elicited by cellobiose on both endoglucanase and CBH activities (Bok et al., 1998; Kruus et al., 1995). Therefore, β-glucosidases not only produce glucose from cellobiose but also reduce cellobiose-mediated repression, thereby allowing the cellulolytic enzymes to function more efficiently.β-Glucosidases may be divided into three groups on the basis of substrate specificity: aryl-β-glucosidases, cellobiases, and broad-specificity β-glucosidases. Aryl-β-glucosidases exhibit an extreme preference toward hydrolysis of aryl-β-glucosides, whereas cellobiases hydrolyze cello-oligosaccharides only (including cellobiose). Members of the third group, termed broad-specificity β-glucosidases, show significant activity on both substrate types and represent the most commonly observed group in cellulolytic microbes (Bhatia et al., 2002). On the basis of amino acid similarities, β-glucosidases are grouped into two GH families, GH1 and GH3 (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/; Table 1.1). Both families hydrolyze their cognate substrate with net retention of configuration of the anomeric carbon. The crystal structures for a GH family 3 β-d-glucan exohydrolase in complex with a variety of transition-state analogs have been reported (Hrmova et al., 2002, 2004, 2005; Varghese et al., 1999). This enzyme exhibits two domains: an N-terminal (α/β)8 TIM-barrel domain and a C-terminal six-stranded β-sandwich domain. Theses enzymes are known to utilize the catalytic residues aspartate and glutamate as the nucleophile and proton donor, respectively (Paal et al., 2004). Family 1 GHs similarly assemble to form (β/α)8 structures but utilize two glutamate residues for catalysis (Moracci et al., 1996; Nijikken et al., 2007).β-Glucosidases are ubiquitous, occurring in organisms representing all domains of life ranging from bacteria to highly evolved mammals. Thermotoga species represent an important source of hyperthermophilic GHs, and many thermophilic β-glucosidases have been obtained from these organisms (Table 1.4). Examples include two GH 1 family β-glucosidases from T. maritima and T. neapolitana that were both active at 100 °C (Park et al., 2005). However, the most thermostable β-glucosidase reported to date comes from the hyperthermophilic archaeon P.furiosus. This β-glucosidase shows optimum activity at 102–105 °C with half-lives of 85 h at 100 °C and 13 h at 110 °C (Kengen et al., 1993). One β-glucosidase with particular biotechnological applicability has been isolated from Thermus sp. Z1. This β-glucosidase displays optimal activity at 85 °C, has a broad optimal pH range (4.5–7.0), and exhibits a half-life of 5 days at 75 °C (Takase and Horikoshi, 1988).Thermostable β-glucosidasesEvidence would suggest that fungi are a particularly rich source of thermostable β-glucosidases with reports of these enzymes being isolated and characterized in numerous strains, including mesophilic species such as Sclerotium glucanicum and Aspergillus phoenicis (Rapp, 1989; Zeng and Zhang, 1989). Both S. glucanicum and A. phoenicis typically grow at 24–27 °C but produce β-glucosidases with temperature optima and stability limits around 60–75 °C. Only moderate increases in thermal stability are seen in enzymes derived from thermophilic fungi, which typically exhibit optimal catalytic activities at temperatures ranging from 65 to 80 °C. It is unclear why some mesophiles have evolved thermostable enzymes, but such a strategy may enable energy conservation through a decreased need for enzyme synthesis due to increased enzymatic stability. It is also possible that these genes in mesophilic fungi were horizontally acquired from organisms that flourish under high temperature conditions.Several fungal β-glucosidases have been shown to produce glucose from larger cellodextrins thus having the potential to increase the rate and extent of lignocellulose deconstruction to fermentable sugars. A thermostable example is found in Aureobasidium pullulans that displays optimal activity at 75 °C and is active on para-nitrophenyl β-d-glucoside, cellobiose, and cellodextrins up to celloheptaose (Saha et al., 1994). A thermostable β-glucosidase of particular biotechnological applicability is found in Paecilomyces thermophila. This enzyme, in addition to β-glucosidase activity, displays exoglucanase and transglycosidase activities (Yang et al., 2008).A factor often overlooked, or rarely reported in the biochemical characterization of β-glucosidases is the degree of glucose-mediated inhibition. The presence of high concentrations of glucose is known to be inhibitory to many β-glucosidases, blocking the substrate from the active site or preventing the hydrolyzed substrate from leaving (Yoon et al., 2008). Such inhibition would undoubtedly feedback across the entire cellulolytic process. Consequently, evaluation of the resistance of β-glucosidase enzymes to such inhibitory action will be critical for moving forward in the development of effective enzyme cocktails for plant cell wall hydrolysis. A recent report illustrates a sensitive new approach to address these requirements (Krogh et al., 2009).Hemicellulose is a highly branched mixture of complex polysaccharides, including xylans, glucans, xyloglucans, callose, mannans, and glucomannans. Xylans, the major hemicellulose component of plant cell walls, can vary dramatically in composition, with the major classes including glucuronoxylan, arabinoxylan, and glucuronoarabinoxylan. In a general sense, a xylan polymer comprises a linear backbone of β-1,4-d-xylopyranoside residues which are commonly substituted by acetyl, arabinofuranosyl, and 4-O-methyl-glucuronyl groups. In nature, the polysaccharide backbone may be modified with these different substituents in variable proportions, and this substitution pattern is primarily governed by the source of the xylan. The architecture becomes more complex with the various hemicellulose components forming intimate interactions with each other as well as plant cell wall cellulose and pectin (Marcus et al., 2008). In this respect, optimizing the enzymatic conversion of lignocellulose to fermentable sugars must take into account hemicellulose depolymerization. In addition, hemicellulose can account for 37–48% of a plant’s primary cell wall (Chesson et al., 1986) and represents an abundant and exploitable source of pentose sugars. Commensurate with the structural complexity of xylan, which in addition to comprising a complex mixture of polysaccharides, is laden with numerous types of glycoside linkages, its complete enzymatic hydrolysis requires the synergistic action of a complex set of enzymes. These include endo-β-1,4-xylanases and β-d-xylosidases acting on the backbone and also debranching enzymes such as α-l-arabinofuranosidases, α-glucuronidases, and esterases (Dodd and Cann, 2009; Fig. 1.3).Enzymatic activities associated with xylan deconstruction. (A) Endoxylanases cleave the backbone of xylan chains to release shorter xylo-oligosaccharides which are further debranched by accessory enzymes. (B) β-Xylosidases release xylose monomers from the nonreducing ends of debranched xylo-oligosaccharides. Adapted from Dodd and Cann (2009).Almost all xylanases that have been described to date are endo-acting; to our knowledge only two bacteria have been reported to produce exo-acting xylanases, in both cases these enzymes were mesophilic (Gasparic et al., 1995; Kubata et al., 1994, 1995). Consequently, the term xylanase is often used in the literature (and will be in this review) to specifically describe endo-acting β-1,4-xylanases. Xylanases catalyze the endo-hydrolysis of 1,4-β-d-xylosidic linkages in a seemingly random fashion, although more recent evidence would suggest the cleavage sites used by GH10 and 11 enzymes are influenced by sidechain substituents (Dodd and Cann, 2009; Kolenova et al., 2006; Maslen et al., 2007). Xylanases have long been utilized in the, food, paper, and fine chemical industries and are well recognized as critical components in the deconstruction of lignocellulose for biofuels production (Garcia-Aparicio et al., 2007). Xylanases largely derive from the GH families 10 and 11, although examples are also described for families 5, 8, and 43 (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/; Table 1.1). Crystal structures have been solved for numerous xylanases from GH families 10 and 11 (Manikandan et al., 2005), with GH family 10 xylanases forming a (β/α)8 TIM-barrel fold and GH family 11 enzymes largely consisting of β-sheets. Despite these inherent differences, xylanase-mediated catalysis from both families occurs via a retention mechanism (Henrissat and Davies, 1997) with two glutamate residues, one acting as the proton donor, and the other acting as a catalytic nucleophile. In the Geobacillus stearothermophilus xylanase, XT6, these residues are Glu159 and Glu265, respectively (Teplitsky et al., 2004).Bacteria comprise a rich resource of thermostable xylanases (Table 1.5), with xylanases from this lineage being generally preferred for lignocellulose hydrolysis, as is currently applied to industrial approaches such as the biobleaching of paper pulp (Giordano et al., 2006).Thermostable XylanasesThe marine ecosystem, in particular, is an important source with several thermostable xylanases having been isolated from this environment (Giordano et al., 2006). Two interesting examples of thermostable xylanases from GH family 10 have been described from T. maritima. The first, XynA, exhibits a multimodular protein structure with an N-terminal signal peptide, two repeated N-terminal CBMs, a catalytic GH 10 xylanase domain, and two repeated C-terminal CBMs (Winterhalter et al., 1995). The C-terminal CBMs were found to bind to microcrystalline cellulose and not xylan. It is thought this property may allow XynA to preferentially engage xylan fragments found closely associated with cellulose. The second T. maritima xylanase, XynB, has an optimal temperature of 90 °C but remains stable at temperatures of up to 100 °C. In addition, this enzyme has an extremely broad pH stability range that spans pH 5–11.4 (Jiang et al., 2001). Many other alkaliphilic xylanase examples have been described, including several from mesophilic Bacillus spp. (Ahlawat et al., 2007; Kashyap et al., 2003; Mamo et al., 2006). These xylanases typically operate over a broad pH range (pH 6–10) and display maximum catalytic activities at 60–75 °C. Bacillus halodurans S7, for example, produces a xylanase with optimum activities at 75 °C at pH 9 and 70 °C at pH 10 (Mamo et al., 2006). Other related thermophilic clades also represent a rich source of alkali-tolerant xylanases, Geobacillus sp MT-1, for example, produces a xylanase with a temperature optimum of 90 °C that is active across the pH range 5.5–10 (Wu et al., 2006). Evidence, therefore, would suggest this trait is more prevalent in xylanases than other lignocellulase enzymes.Despite the current preference for bacterial xylanases in industrial processes, it has been suggested that fungal xylanases may be of greater use due to their stronger catalytic activities (Lee et al., 2009). Indeed the xylanases with the highest reported catalytic rates belong to the thermophilic xylanases of Aspergillus awamori, Bispora sp. and Neurospora crassa, which exhibit specific activities greater than 104 U/mg (Kormelink et al., 1993; Luo et al., 2009; Mishra et al., 1984). The Bispora sp. xylanase, Xyn10C, in particular appears to be an attractive option for biotechnological adaptation. This enzyme displays optimal activity at 80 °C, higher than any other fungal xylanase, and is active over a broad pH range (pH 1.5–6). In addition Xyn10C was resistant to a number of cations, including Na+, K+, Li+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Mn2+ which are inhibitory to many other described xylanases (Luo et al., 2009). Aside from these few enzymes with extreme catalytic potential, there appears to be little difference in the average specific activities between xylanases described for the two lineages (both ~ 103 U/mg; Sunna and Antranikian, 1997).β-d-Xylosidases generate d-xylose from xylobiose and other short chain xylo-oligosaccharides. β-d-xylosidases are found in GH families 3, 30, 39, 43, 51, 52, and 54, with all, but family 43 enzymes, exerting their catalytic activities via the retention mechanism (Table 1.1). For those families with which structural information has been determined or inferred, the common structural conformation exhibited is a (β/α)8 fold (families 30, 39, and 51), although family 43 enzymes form a fivefold β-propeller. The catalytic residues for families 30, 39, and 51 comprise a pair of glutamate amino acids, while family 52 enzymes utilize a glutamate residue as the catalytic nucleophile and an aspartate as the proton donor (Bravman et al., 2001; Czjzek et al., 2005; Zverlov et al., 1998b; CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/).In an analogous role to β-glucosidases, found in cellulase systems, β-d-xylosidases are important in the relief of end-product inhibition of xylanases caused by xylobiose. Thermostable β-d-xylosidases have been isolated from a number of fungi and some bacteria. The genus Aspergillus, in particular, appears to be a significant resource with reports of thermophilic β-d-xylosidases being characterized from no less than 10 species of this genus (Kiss and Kiss, 2000; Kitamoto et al., 1999; Kitpreechavanich et al., 1986; Kormelink et al., 1993; Kumar and Ramon, 1996; Pedersen et al., 2007; Rizzatti et al., 2001). The optimum temperature for these enzymes ranges from 50 to >75 °C and covers the pH range 3.0–6.5. In another analogy to β-glucosidases, the performance of β-xylosidases is typically inhibited by increasing concentrations of their end-product, xylose. Interestingly, a thermophilic β-xylosidase from the fungus Scytalidium thermophilum was, however, found to be immune to xylose-mediated inhibition (Zanoelo et al., 2004). Features such as this are likely to be immensely important to the overall efficiency of biocatalysts in the biofuel industry.α-Glucuronidases catalyze the cleavage of the α-1,2-glycosidic bond between 4-O-methyl α-glucuronic acid and the terminal nonreducing end xylopyranosyl unit of small xylo-oligosaccharides (Mierzwa et al., 2005; Puls et al., 1987). Their activities on polymeric xylan and para-nitrophenyl α-d-glucuronopyranoside are typically negligible, although interestingly, a thermostable α-glucuronidase from the bacterium T. maritima was found to hydrolyze para-nitrophenyl α-d-glucuronopyranoside, with an optimum temperature of 80 °C (Suresh et al., 2003). α-Glucuronidases cluster into two groups within GH family 67, defined by either bacterial or fungal origin. The α-glucuronidases of the two origins differ in their molecular mass and quaternary structures, but the enzymes share highly conserved active site architectures. Bacterial α-glucuronidases function as homodimers with monomeric molecular weights of about 70 kDa, while fungal α-glucuronidases function as monomeric proteins with a molecular weight of about 90 kDa (De Wet et al., 2006). This discrepancy in the monomeric molecular weights for α-glucuronidases isolated from these two separate sources is likely due to glycosylation of the fungal enzymes. These enzymes utilize an inverting mechanism for catalysis (Fig. 1.4), and although the proton-donating residue is known to be a glutamate, the nucleophile has yet to be determined (Biely et al., 2000; CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/).Catalytic mechanism of α-glucuronidase enzymes. These enzymes bind oligosaccharides with 4-O-methyl glucuronic acid side chains substituted at the 2’ hydroxyl group of a terminal xylose residue at the nonreducing end. The catalytic base then activates a water molecule which displaces the attached xylose residue.Relatively few thermostable α-glucuronidases have been described compared to other lignocellulosic enzymes. Both the fungi A. pullulans and T. aurantiacus produce α-glucuronidases, each with optimal catalytic activity at 65 °C (Khandke et al., 1989). Perhaps the most promising α-glucuronidase described to date, however, is AguA from T. maritima which displays optimum catalytic activity at 85 °C (Xue et al., 2004).Arabinan comprises a significant portion of plant cell walls where it is widely distributed among hemicellulosic and pectic polysaccharides (Verhertbruggen et al., 2009). The arabinan polymer forms a linear backbone of α-1,5-linked l-arabinofuranosyl residues, which can be substituted with α-1,2- and/or α-1,3-linked l-arabinose side chains (McNeil et al., 1984). The hydrolysis of arabinan is facilitated by the synergy between endo-1,5-α-l-arabinanases and α-l-arabinofuranosidases (Fig. 1.5). Endo-1,5-α-l-arabinanases hydrolyze α-1,5-l-arabinofuranoside linkages between arabinose units in an endo-manner with an inverting catalytic mechanism. All endo-1,5-α-l-arabinanases belong to GH family 43 (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/), a family for which members catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages through an inverting mechanism. A crystal structure has been produced for an endoarabinanase from the thermophilic bacterium, Bacillus thermodenitrificans TS-3, showing the enzyme to adopt a five-bladed β-propeller fold. The endo-acting nature of the enzyme is facilitated by an open substrate-binding cleft that would allow random binding of the arabinan substrate. The N-terminal region is thought to play an important role in the thermostability (Yamaguchi et al., 2005).Enzymatic activities associated with arabinan hydrolysis. Endoarabinanases cleave α-1,5 linkages between main chain arabinose residues. α-l-Arabinofuranosidases release arabinose monomers by cleaving α-1,2, α-1,3, or α-1,5 linked arabinose residues from the nonreducing end.Only a few examples of thermostable endo-1,5-α-l-arabinanases have been characterized (Table 1.6) and these appear to be exclusively of bacterial origin. Perhaps the best characterized endoarabinanases are those from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus and the previously described enzyme from B. thermodenitrificans (Mi-Ri Hong and Deok-Kun, 2009; Takao et al., 2002). The C. saccharolyticus enzyme appears particularly thermostable, exhibiting maximum enzyme activity at 75 °C with half-lives of 2440, 254, and 93 h at 65, 70, and 75 °C, respectively.Thermostable α-L-arabinases and α-L-arabinofuranosidasesIn contrast to α-l-arabinanases, α-l-arabinofuranosidases are exo-acting enzymes that hydrolyze terminal α-1,5-glycosidic linkages to arabinofuranosides in arabinan as well as α-1,2 and α-1,3-linkages to arabinofuranosides of arabinan, arabinoxylan, and arabinogalactan (Matsuo et al., 2000). These enzymes work synergistically with other hemicellulolytic enzymes removing l-arabinose sidechains that would otherwise restrict the activity of the backbone-degrading enzymes (Fig. 1.5).Arabinofuranosidases are classified into five GH families: 3, 43, 51, 54, and 62 (Table 1.1). The structural conformations and catalytic mechanisms for each of these enzyme families have been described in the preceding sections of this review with the exception of GH family 62 for which no information is currently available regarding structure, catalytic mechanism, or residues important to the active site (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/). GH 43 arabinofuranosidases act on terminal α-1,5-linked arabinofuranosides. GH 51 and GH 54 family arabinofuranosidases remove both α-1,2 and α-1,3 arabinofuranosyl moieties from arabinan and xylans (Flipphi et al., 1994; Matsuo et al., 2000), while the activity of GH 62 family enzymes appears to be specific to arabinoxylans (Taylor et al., 2006; Tsujibo et al., 2002). To date almost all thermostable arabinofuranosidases described appear to derive from GH family 51. This family of arabinofuranosidases appears especially potent as exemplified by C. thermocellum, an organism displaying significant xylanolytic activity with just a single identifiable family 51 α-l-arabinofuranosidase, CtAraf51A (Taylor et al., 2006). The most thermostable α-l-arabinofuranosidase described currently is found in Thermobacillus xylanilyticus D3. This enzyme is stable up to 90 °C and has significant biotechnological applicability with activity ranging from pH 4 to 12 (Debeche et al., 2000).Thermostable α-l-arabinofuranosidases have also been found in fungi; for example, two arabinofuranosidases exhibiting optimal activity at 60 and 55 °C were purified from solid-state cultures of Penicillium capsulatum (Filho et al., 1996). In addition, a novel thermostable α-l-arabinofuranosidase from A. pullulans was shown to have optimal activity at 75 °C and can hydrolyze arabinan and debranched arabinan but shows no activity against arabinogalactan (Saha and Bothast, 1998).Crystal structures have been solved for two GH 51 family α-l-arabinofuranosidases (Hovel et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2006). In both examples the enzyme appeared to function as a hexamer, with monomeric components assembling to form a (β/α)8 catalytic domain linked to a 12-stranded β-barrel C-terminal domain. Similar to other GH 51 family enzymes, catalysis occurs with net retention of the anomeric carbon atom configuration (Pitson et al., 1996). The residues Glu173 and Glu292, of the thermophilic α-l-arabinofuranosidase, CtAraf51 from C. thermocellum act as the acid/base proton donor and nucleophile, respectively (Taylor et al., 2006).Plant cell wall polysaccharides, particularly those comprising the hemicellulose fraction, such as xylans, mannans, and glucomannans, as well as pectin, are commonly acetylated and on occasion feruloylated, with O-bound acetyl groups comprising up to 7% of plant cell walls by dry weight (Brett and Waldren, 1996). Xylans, the major hemicellulosic component, in particular, are typically rich in acetyl and 4-O-methyl substituents in the β-1,4-linked backbone. In fact studies of hardwood xylans suggest that as much as 60–70% of xylose residues are esterified with acetic acid. Acetylated xylans are also common to perennial plants (Biely et al., 1986, Shao and Wiegel, 1995).Esterases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis (and formation) of ester bonds. Acetyl xylan esterases catalyze the removal of acetyl ester groups from C2 or C3 positions of d-xylopyranosyl residues (Biely, 2003), while ferulic acid esterases release ferulic acid from the C2 or C5 positions of α-L-arabinofuranosyl side chains (Salnier and Thibault, 1999). Ferulic acids esterified to arabinofuranosyl side chains commonly link with other ferulic acid esters forming various types of diferuloyl bridges resulting in the inter-, and possibly even intralinking of polymers within plant cell walls (Iiyama et al., 1994). Consequently, the efficient and complete degradation of acetylated xylans requires the cooperation of esterases with other xylanolyric enzymes. Furthermore, phenolic acids released through the action of esterases are potential precursors to a variety of value-added products and may be exploited as a means to offset some of the costs currently limiting the feasibility of biorefineries (Faulds et al., 2000; Graf, 1992).As esterase activity is not directed at glycosidic linkages, these enzymes are not classified within GH families; however, similar to GHs, carbohydrate esterases (CEs) are able to be grouped by the predicted structure of their catalytic domains. Currently there are 16 CE families, with members of each family utilizing conserved catalytic apparatus to execute identical catalytic mechanisms (Correia et al., 2008; CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/). The expanse of CE families appears to be necessary due to the apparently limited substrate specificity typically displayed by these enzymes (Aurilia et al., 2000; Correia et al., 2008; Dalrymple et al., 1997). Thermostable acetyl xylan esterases have been purified and characterized from just a handful of bacteria including the anaerobic bacteria Thermoanaerobacterium sp. and C. thermocellum (Correia et al., 2008). To date most reported thermostable acetyl esterases have optimal activity at near-neutral pHs and ~70–80 °C, although an acetyl esterase from Thermoanaerobacterium sp. displays optimal activity at 84 °C (Shao and Wiegel, 1995). Bacterial examples of thermostable feruloyl esterases appear even rarer. A few examples have been reported from clostridia, including a naturally occurring ferulic acid esterase/xylanase enzyme hybrid from C. thermocellum (Kataeva et al., 2001). The bacterium Clostridium stercorarium produces an interesting feruloyl esterase that has temperature and pH optima of 65 °C and pH 8.0, respectively, and is active on ester-linked ferulic, coumaric, caffeic, and sinapinic acids (Donaghy et al., 2000). Examples of fungal esterases with thermostable activity on ester-linked acetate and/or ferulate have recently been expanded significantly. Bioprospecting of thermotolerant fungal strains by Ghatora et al., 2006 led to the description of 84 acetyl-xylan and ferulic-acid esterases that appear to have activity optima spanning at least pH 4–9.Crystal structures have been solved for one or more esterases from most CE families (1, 3–11, 13 and 14) and all, with the exception of those from CE family 4, which exhibit a distorted (β/α)8 barrel, have a typical α/β hydrolase fold. Those from CE families 1 and 5–7 are serine esterases that utilize classical Ser-His-Asp catalytic triads (Correia et al., 2008). Site-specific mutational analysis of a CE family 3 acetyl xylan esterase from C. thermocellum revealed Ser44 to be the nucleophile, His208 to be the proton donor and Asp205 to play an important role in increasing the basic character of the histidine (Correia et al., 2008).Mannan is a major constituent of hemicellulose where it exists in a variety of forms, including linear mannan, glucomannan, galactomannan, or glucogalactomannan (Fig. 1.6). Each of these polymers comprises a β-1,4-linked backbone of mannose residues that may be substituted up to 33% (or up to 50% in hardwoods) with glucose residues. In the case of galactomannans or glucogalactomannans, galactose residues form α-1,6-linkages to the mannan backbone (Moreira and Filho, 2008). The biodegradation of mannan into oligosaccharides or fermentable sugars involves the synergy of various mannan-degrading enzymes. β-1,4-d-mannanases hydrolyze β-(1,4)-linkages in the backbone of mannan polymers, producing short-chain manno-oligomers. These are further degraded through the action of β-1,4-d-mannosidases. Additional enzymes such as acetyl esterases and α-galactosidases remove side-chain substituents attached at various points along the mannan backbone, thereby creating additional sites for subsequent hydrolysis (Moreira and Filho, 2008).Enzymatic activities associated with hydrolysis of various mannans. There are four different types of mannan: linear mannan, glucomannan, galactomannan, and galactoglucomannan. In all four types of mannan, β-mannanase enzymes cleave β-1,4 linkages between either mannose and glucose or mannose and mannose sugars within the backbone chain. In galactomannan and galactoglucomannan, α-galactosidase enzymes release galactose residues which are appended at the 6’ hydroxyl groups of main chain mannose or glucose residues. In glucomannan and galactoglucomannan, β-glucosidase enzymes cleave glucose residues from the nonreducing ends of oligosaccharides produced by the action of β-mannanase enzymes.β-1,4-d-Mannanases are found in GH families 5, 26, and 113, while β-mannosidases are found in GH families 1, 2, and 5. All β-mannanases and β-mannosidases assemble to form a (β/α)8 fold and exhibit catalytic activity via a retaining mechanism, utilizing two glutamate residues as the nucleophile and proton donor (CAZy; http://www.cazy.org/; Table 1.1).β-Mannanases are common constituents of the plant cell-wall-degrading arsenals of various bacteria and fungi (Table 1.7). One particularly interesting mannanase was described from Caldanaerobius polysaccharolyticus. This thermostable mannanase exhibits both endomannanase and endoglucanase activity presumably by virtue of its unusual multidomain structure. This enzyme is fitted with a putative mannanase-cellulase dual-function catalytic domain, two CBMs, and a surface-layer-like protein region (SLH-1, SLH-2, and SLH-3; Cann et al., 1999). Characterization of the two CBMs reveals high specificity toward β-1,4-linked sugars as well as both cello- and mannopolysaccharides (Bae et al., 2008). Given the conformational relationship between glucose and mannose (mannose is a C2 epimer of glucose) the catalytic activity of mannanases may be expected to extend to glucose-based polymers; however, this is rarely the case. Structural comparisons of a GH 5 family mannanase from Thermomonospora fusca with GH family 5 cellulases suggest specificity may be achieved through a hydrophobic interaction between the substrate and a conserved valine residue, Val263, which may enable discrimination between the conformational differences occurring at the hydroxymethyl group of mannan and cellulose, along with a specific interaction in the −2 subsite between an aspartate residue, Asp259, and the axial hydroxyl group of C2 (Hilge et al., 1998). Examples of significant thermostability are also seen within this group of enzymes, for example a β-mannanase from B. stearothermophilus was able to retain near-full activity after 24 h at 70 °C (Talbot and Sygusch, 1990), while a β-mannanase from Thermotoga neapolitana exhibited a half-life of 13 h at its temperature optima of 91 °C. In addition, T. neapolitana appears to possess a β-mannosidase with comparable attributes (Duffaud et al., 1997; McCutchen et al., 1996). Other β-mannosidases have been reported, including an extremely thermostable GH family 1 enzyme from P. furiosus, which has a half-life of > 60 h at 90 °C and exhibits maximal activity at 105 °C (Bauer et al., 1996).Thermostable β-mannanases and β-mannosidasesSeveral thermostable α-galactosidases have also been reported from bacteria, archaea, and yeast (Brouns et al., 2006; Carrera-Silva et al., 2006; Shankar et al., 2009). It will be interesting to see, during the optimization of lignocellulosic enzyme cocktails, if auxiliary enzymes such as α-galactosidases affect the economy of the process.Questions regarding the structural basis of thermostability are not new, nor are they confined to studies of enzymes facilitating plant cell wall deconstruction. An enzyme’s stability is defined by its capacity to retain its active structural conformation in spite of disruptive forces, such as increases in temperature. The major forces leading to, and maintaining, an enzyme’s active conformation are hydrophobic effects and hydrogen bonding. In the native setting, these and other stabilizing forces typically outweigh disruptive forces by as little as 5–10 kcal mol−1. This balance is known as the free energy change, ΔG, of a protein (Pace, 1975). A recent review on thermostable proteins found, relative to mesophilic homologues, that thermostability was most commonly implied through increases in ΔG across all temperatures (resulting from an increase in ΔH–change in enthalpy—at the temperature of maximum stability, without changes to ΔS—change in entropy) and decreases in ΔCp—the change in heat capacity—rather than increases in the maximum thermal stability (Razvi and Scholtz, 2006). This was particularly evident for enzymes and likely derives from a catalytic intolerance to structural rigidity (Hammel et al., 2004; Jaenicke, 2000). Broad increases in ΔG may be mediated by stabilizing features such as salt or disulfide bridges, ion pairings, and increases in interactions between aromatic residues—particularly in the active site. Comparisons between the numerous crystal structures available for thermophilic- and mesophilic- acting GH enzymes have revealed these features to be common (Ihsanawati et al., 2005). For example the R. marinus endocellulase Cel12A, which shows optimal activity at > 90 °C, has a significant increase in ion pairings and an increase in aromatic residues in the active site as compared to its mesophilic counterparts (Crennell et al., 2002). Further, enzyme engineering strategies that have been used to introduce disulfide bridges, aromatic residues, or salt bridges to mesophilic or moderately thermophilic enzymes have succeeded in enhancing thermostability and/or thermophilicity (Georis et al., 2000; Xie et al., 2006). In one example, the introduction of disulfide bridges to a GH family 11 xylanase from Thermobacillus xylanilyticus resulted in a 10-fold increase in thermal stability compared to that of the wild-type enzyme with no commensurate loss in specific activity (Paes and O’Donohue, 2006). A decrease in ΔCp can be mediated by tighter core packing or oligomerization. Structural analysis of a xylanase with enhanced thermostability, produced through random mutagenesis, revealed the introduction of a valine residue that filled the hydrophobic core with an increased number of van der Waals interactions (Xie et al., 2006). Further comparisons of thermostable and mesophilic GHs have identified reductions in the exposure of hydrophobic residues (Ihsanawati et al., 2005) and reductions in the exposed surface area through oligomerization or substrate binding as means to enhance thermostability (Chi et al., 1999). Although less common, increases in the maximum thermal stability brought about through increases in structural rigidity have been surmised from comparative structural analyses particularly in connecting loops (Crennell et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2003). Increases in rigidity may also be brought about through glycosylation or interactions with metal ions (Hong et al., 2003; Yan et al., 2008). Another important difference in the primary structure of thermophilic GHs relative to mesophilic GHs is a reduction in thermolabile residues, such as Asn and Cys (Wang et al., 2003). Understanding the mechanisms of thermal stability and using the structural features, as described earlier, has and will continue to enable targeted approaches to improving the thermostability of GH enzymes.In addition to bioprospecting, many groups are moving forward through the manipulation of enzymes already available to researchers. Single or successive rounds of random mutagenesis using methods such as error-prone PCR or DNA shuffling, followed by selection for improvements in desired traits, such as catalytic activity, thermostability, or pH tolerance is becoming a commonly employed tool for optimizing an enzyme’s characteristics (Stephens et al., 2009, Wang and Xia, 2008). This process, known as directed evolution, is not new but allows researchers a route forward in the absence of knowledge regarding the features underpinning these traits. These methods have successfully led to significant increases in catalytic activity, thermostability, and pH stability of a number of xylanases (Chen et al., 2001; Stephens et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 2007; Wang and Xia, 2008). Methods are continuing to be developed to expedite and simplify the selection procedures (Liu et al., 2009). Other more calculated approaches include the structure-guided recombination process, SCHEMA (Meyer et al., 2006). The SCHEMA process produces chimeric proteins by interchanging contiguous blocks of amino acids. SCHEMA is more directed than a random process, using the parental proteins’ structural data to define the boundaries of these amino acid blocks so as to minimize the average number of amino acid sidechain contacts that are broken in the library. SCHEMA was recently employed to develop a library of CBHs with improved thermal stability. Chimeric CBHs were produced through recombination of CBH genes from the fungi Chaetomium thermophilum, Humicola insolens, and Hypocrea jecorina (Heinzelman et al., 2009). Although the authors only studied a small fraction of the library of chimeras (48 from 6561 total chimeras), a number of novel enzymes with improved traits were identified, including HJPlus, which gave a high specific activity across a broad pH range and exhibited a 7–15 °C increase in temperature optimum over the parental enzymes. Given the sampling size, it is predicted that many more enzymes with improved thermal stability, along with other biotechnological attributes, may reside within this chimeric library, and consequently this appears a very valuable approach.Similarly, the exchange of identifiable modules can lead to commensurate increases in thermostability and hydrolytic activity. An obvious example is the addition of CBMs to enzymes lacking this module, which has regularly been shown to improve performance, particularly against crystalline substrate (Kang et al., 2007; Kittur et al., 2003; Szijarto et al., 2008). Module shuffling between two GH 10 family xylanases with different thermostabilities, Cex (optimum temperature: 40 °C) from Cellulomonas fimi and XylA (optimum temperature: 80 °C) from Thermomonospora alba, led to a recombinant enzyme that exhibited significantly improved thermal profiles (optimum temperature: 65 °C) compared to one of the parental proteins, Cex (Ahsan et al., 2001). Studies such as these suggest that in some proteins, specific protein domains may exist that confer or enhance thermostability. Consistent with this hypothesis the deletion of particular domains resident in some cellulases and hemicellulases has resulted in decreases in thermostability (Hayashi et al., 1997; Riedel et al., 1998). One such domain, the A-domain, has been identified in the N-terminal regions of xylanases from organisms such as T. maritima, C. thermocellum, and T. saccharolyticum (Fontes et al., 1995; Lee et al., 1993) and has been shown to improve its cognate enzyme’s thermostability and substrate-binding capacity (He et al., 2009). This may suggest that a major source of thermoinstability derives from the binding module. It is evident from these studies that modest changes in an enzymes primary structure can lead to significant improvements in biotechnologically important traits (Stephens et al., 2009), although such changes may also lead to undesirable properties.The extracellular cellulolytic enzymes of several bacteria, particularly Clostridia, assemble as protein complexes or aggregates known as cellulosomes. Cellulosomes have often been attributed with having improved catalytic activities, particularly on crystalline substrate, as compared to the free form (individually acting) enzymes due to the improved synergy afforded by colocalization of complementary enzymatic activities (Fierobe et al., 2005). Consequently significant research has been invested in developing thermostable cellulosomes and optimizing their enzymatic constituents. The rozettazyme, for instance, is a group II chaperonin that derives from the hyperthermo-acidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae, which has been retrofitted with cohesin modules from the C. thermocellum CipA protein. This synthetic scaffoldin self-assembles in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ ions into a thermostable double-ringed structure capable of aggregating 18 complementary enzymatic activities through interactions between their dockerin domains and the cohesins (Mitsuzawa et al., 2009). In native systems, cellulosome-associated activities are wide ranging and can include cellulases, hemicellulases, pectinases, chitinases, glycosidases, and esterases (Zverlov et al., 2002, 2005a,b,c) demonstrating the heterogeneous and highly associative nature of the substrates that these systems have evolved to degrade (Zverlov et al., 2005a,c). The development of synthetic cellulosomes that are effective in biotechnological applications will require optimization of the enzyme constituents. Recently derived methods such as cohesin-dockerin microarrays will undoubtedly simplify this process (Haimovitz et al., 2008).An alternative approach for colocalizing synergistic lignocellulase activities is the construction of gene fusions (Hong et al., 2006). Both approaches have shown promising results; however, issues have occasionally emerged with the latter regarding enzyme folding and stability.The applicability of thermostable enzymes as biocatalysts for the depolymerization of lignocellulosic feedstock in the production of biofuels is gaining wide industrial and biotechnological interest. Their robust thermostabilities make them better suited for the harsh processing conditions required for efficient deconstruction of lignocellulose to fermentable products. The thermostabilities of these enzymes have been attributed to many factors, such as: (a) amino acid composition, including decreases in thermolabile residues such as Asn and Cys; (b) hydrophobic interactions; (c) aromatic interactions, ion pairs, and increased salt bridge networks; (d) oligomerization and intersubunit interactions; (e) packing and reduction of solvent-exposed surface area; (f) metal binding; (g) substrate stabilization; and (h) a decrease in number and size of surface loops. It is likely that each of these in the correct context may contribute to thermostability. Researchers have correspondingly developed methods to enhance the thermal stability and activity of lignocellulosic enzymes, using both random and directed approaches.A considerable number of enzymes applicable to lignocellulose depolymerization have been investigated. With the seemingly continual emergence of potential sources being uncovered (Ghatora et al., 2006; Picart et al., 2007, 2008; Tai et al., 2004), particularly through culture-independent techniques such as metagenomics (Elend et al., 2006; Feng et al., 2007; Ferrer et al., 2005; Grant et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2006; Rees et al., 2003; Voget et al., 2006) and metatranscriptomics (Warnecke and Hess, 2009), it is hard to be sure when, or if, we will realize the complete diversity of these enzymes in nature. This review has considered thermostable enzymes required for the depolymerization of lignocellulosic substrates to fermentable sugars, largely in the context of bioethanol or longer chain biofuel production; however, research is also proceeding into alternate energy sources such as hydrogen, which require further enzymatic activities. The complete conversion of cellulosic substrate to H2 has been shown using mesophilic systems to be possible with as few as 13 enzymes and a coenzyme, and yield almost 12 H2 molecules per glucose equivalent (Ye et al., 2009). Commensurate with this work thermostable enzymes important to this expanded process are also starting to be described (Wang and Zhang, 2009).The hydrolytic performance of most described cellulases and hemicellulases has been well defined; however, just a handful of studies (e.g., see Kambourova et al., 2007) have examined these same enzymes in the context of a multicomponent synergistic mixture, which must be the ultimate goal of this research field. Lignocellulose is a highly complex and rigid substrate. The crystallinity of cellulose, the available surface area, and the distribution therein of lignin and hemicellulose are substrate-related factors limiting the hydrolysis rate of plant cell walls. To enable the production of plentiful amounts of hexose, as well as pentose, or monosaccharides for biofuel production, optimizing thermostable enzyme mixtures for both cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis will be essential, as this will reduce the overall cost of production.Clearly the research area in this field is multifaceted with areas beyond the scope of this review. This includes areas such as the optimization of enzyme expression systems, which may include the engineering of the plants themselves (Kimura et al., 2003; Oraby et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007) or the bioengineering of fermentative organisms, such as yeast to produce “one-stop biorefineries” with thermotolerant cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic capabilities (Hong et al., 2007b). It is, however, clear that regardless of the system employed, optimization of the process will require a better understanding/knowledge of the enzymes facilitating the deconstruction of lignocellulose.We thank the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI) for supporting our research on lignocellulose deconstruction. We would also like to thank Shinichi Kiyonari, Shosuke Yoshida, and Michael Iakiviak of the Energy Biosciences Institute for scientific discussions."
PMC4561535,"Xylan degradation, a metabolic property shared by rumen and human colonic Bacteroidetes",False,"Microbial inhabitants of the bovine rumen fulfil the majority of the normal caloric requirements of the animal by fermenting lignocellulosic plant polysaccharides and releasing short chain fatty acids that are then metabolized by the host. This process also occurs within the human colon, although the fermentation products contribute less to the overall energy requirements of the host. Mounting evidence, however, indicates that the community structure of the distal gut microbiota is a critical factor that influences the inflammatory potential of the immune system thereby impacting the progression of inflammatory bowel diseases. Non-digestible dietary fibre derived from plant material is highly enriched in the lignocellulosic polysaccharides, cellulose and xylan. Members of the Bacteroidetes constitute a dominant phylum in both the human colonic microbiome and the rumen microbial ecosystem. In the current article, we review recent insights into the molecular mechanisms for xylan degradation by rumen and human commensal members of the Bacteroidetes phylum, and place this information in the context of the physiological and metabolic processes that occur within these complex microbial environments.The plant cell wall polysaccharide, xylan, is an abundant substrate supporting microbial fermentation in the digestive tracts of ruminants as well as humans. Xylan is the second most abundant plant cell wall polysaccharide next to cellulose in monocotyledonous grasses, which comprise the primary feedstuff of grazing animals. Cereal grains are a primary component of dietary fibre consumed by humans and possess a very high xylan content (Selvendran, 1984). Xylan consists of a β-1,4-linked xylose backbone which may be substituted at the 2′-OH or 3′-OH with other molecules such as acetyl groups, 4-O-methyl glucuronyl groups, or arabinose. Furthermore, ferulic acid or p-coumaric acid esterified to arabinose moieties may facilitate cross-linking of this polysaccharide to other hemicellulosic polymers or to the structural polymer, lignin. Xylan therefore contains a variety of chemical linkages, and thus its degradation requires a number of different enzymatic activities. These enzymes include endoxylanases, β-xylosidases, α-l-arabinofuranosidases, α-glucuronidases, ferulic acid esterases and acetyl xylan esterases, which have all been recently reviewed in the context of xylan degradation (Dodd and Cann, 2009).In the bovine rumen approximately 36–79% of the ingested xylan is degraded (Van Soest, 1994). In humans the extent of xylan degradation has not been directly measured, but from studies of total hemicellulose degradation, it is estimated to be between 51% and 72% (Slavin et al., 1981). These studies suggest that xylan degradation is an important process that contributes to the maintenance of microbial communities in the rumen and human colonic ecosystems. Despite this importance, the detailed biochemical processes employed by the resident xylanolytic microbes to acquire energy from recalcitrant xylan polymers are yet to be completely elucidated. Two genera of the phylum Bacteroidetes, the Bacteroides spp. (Chassard et al., 2007) and Prevotella spp. (Bryant et al., 1958; Dehority, 1966) are among the most frequently isolated xylanolytic organisms from human fecal samples and the bovine rumen respectively (Table 1). The rumen Prevotella spp. were first classified as two species, Bacteroides ruminicola ssp. ruminicola and B. ruminicola ssp. brevis; however, as more strains were isolated, it became clear that these organisms differed considerably from the human colonic Bacteroides and thus they were re-classified into the new genus Prevotella (Shah and Collins, 1990). Prevotella ruminicola was later subdivided into four species, P. ruminicola, Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella albensis and Prevotella brevis on the basis of carbohydrate utilization patterns and genotypic characteristics (Avgustin et al., 1997). Recently, the analysis of xylanolytic bacteria in the human colon has been revisited (Chassard et al., 2007) and xylanolytic Bacteroides spp. previously thought to be dominant xylan utilizers, such as B. ovatus and B. fragilis ssp. A (Salyers et al., 1977; Hespell and Whitehead, 1990), were not isolated. Additional xylanolytic members of this genus were, however, identified and these included B. intestinalis DSM 17393 (Bakir et al., 2006), B. cellulosilyticus DSM 14838 (Robert et al., 2007) and B. xylanisolvens XB1A (Chassard et al., 2008). These studies revealed that the xylan degrading community within the human colon is more complex than previously envisioned and although these studies might be biased by the culture-based techniques employed, the results clearly indicate that the Bacteroidetes represent a significant xylanolytic group within the human colonic microbial ecosystem.Xylanolytic gut Bacteroidetes.Genes encoding enzymes involved in xylan degradation have been identified previously in Bacteroidetes members from the rumen, including P. ruminicola 23, P. ruminicola D31d and P. bryantii B14, as well as from the human colon such as Bacteroides ovatus V975 and Bacteroides xylanisolvens XB1A (Table 2). Of these xylanolytic bacteria, P. bryantii B14 and B. ovatus 0038 (ATCC 8483) are the best studied organisms. Flint and colleagues identified a gene cluster in the genome of P. bryantii B14, which contained β-xylosidase and endoxylanase genes as well as other genes predicted to encode proteins with roles in xylan degradation, including a putative xylose/sodium symporter, a putative acetylxylan esterase and a putative α-glucuronidase (Gasparic et al., 1995a). The expression of these genes is controlled at the transcriptional level by a hybrid two-component system (HTCS) regulator (XynR) (Miyazaki et al., 2003).Summary of xylanolytic enzymes characterized from gut-associated Bacteroidetes.The arrangement of this gene cluster in P. bryantii B14 exhibits similarities to a gene cluster that was previously cloned from the B. ovatus ATCC 8483 chromosome (Fig. 1A) (Whitehead and Hespell, 1990). To analyse the importance of this gene cluster for xylan utilization, four different segments of the DNA fragment containing the gene cluster were subsequently cloned into pBT-2, a suicide vector, and used to construct disruptions in the B. ovatus ATCC 8483 chromosome (Fig. 1A) (Weaver et al., 1992). Insertion of this plasmid results in a duplication of the integrated region, which then flanks the vector sequence, which has an approximate length of 14 kb. Insertion of pBT-2 in the gene immediately upstream of xylI (mutant ΩK, Fig. 1A) led to a reduction in the growth rate with hot-water extracted xylans from oat spelts and a decrease in xylanase, xylosidase and arabinosidase activities in cell extracts (Fig. 1B). Insertion of pBT-2 within xylI (mutant Ω20C, Fig. 1A) also resulted in a reduction in growth rate with xylan and decreases in xylanase and xylosidase activities; however the arabinosidase activity was comparable to that of the wild-type strain. The observation that the ΩK mutant exhibited reduced arabinosidase activity whereas the Ω20C activity was comparable to the wild-type indicated both that xsa does not encode the only arabinosidase enzyme in B. ovatus ATCC 8483 and that the gene immediately upstream of xylI (a putative pentose transporter) may influence arabinosidase expression.A. Conservation of xylan hydrolase gene clusters in B. ovatus ATCC 8483 and P. bryantii B14. The corresponding genes in the two bacteria are connected by dashed lines, and the per cent amino acid identity between the gene products is indicated. Open reading frame numbers are indicated within each of the genes. N.S., not significant amino acid identity. A map of insertional mutants constructed in the chromosome of B. ovatus ATCC 8483, as described in the text, is indicated below the corresponding genes.B. Phenotypes associated with the insertional mutants indicated in (A) and described in the text. Data are derived from Weaver et al. (1992). OD, optical density.The Ω20C mutant exhibited a growth rate defect, thus to evaluate whether xylI or xsa was responsible for this phenotype, a mutant was generated that resulted in a disruption of the distal 300 nucleotides of the xsa gene (mutant ΩHK, Fig. 1A). Mutant ΩHK exhibited xylanase and arabinosidase activities comparable to the wild-type strain, however the xylosidase activity was lower and a growth rate defect with xylan was observed. Since disruption of the gene downstream of xsa did not yield a discernable phenotype (mutant ΩH, Fig. 1A), the authors concluded that disruption of xsa alone was responsible for the growth rate defect with xylan as a carbon source. Thus, the degradation of xylo-oligosaccharides to xylose by Xsa appears to be the rate-limiting step for xylan utilization by B. ovatus ATCC 8483.Although several of these mutants exhibited growth rate defects with xylan, they eventually reached the same cell density as the wild-type and the overall extent of xylan degradation in mutant ΩK was similar to the wild-type. These observations indicate that compensatory mechanisms exist within B. ovatus ATCC 8483 to permit complete utilization of xylan in the absence of xylI, xsa, as well as the putative pentose transporter located upstream of xylI. Indeed, the recent genome sequence for B. ovatus ATCC 8483 has revealed the presence of five putative GH10 endo-xylanase genes and ~13 putative β-xylosidase genes, which indicates that the organism possesses additional enzymes that participate in xylan utilization. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that a second gene cluster that contains homologues of xylI, xsa and the pentose transporter (BACOVA_00487, BACOVA_00488, BACOVA_00489) is present in the genome in the same orientation (data not shown).Xylanase activity is cell-associated in the rumen bacterium P. bryantii B14 (Miyazaki et al., 1997) as well as the human colonic bacteria, B. eggerthii and B. ovatus (Salyers et al., 1982; Weaver et al., 1992). This raises an important question of how these bacteria efficiently utilize large polysaccharides in the apparent absence of an extensive extracellular xylanase system. The answer to this question may lie in the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron starch utilization system (Sus), which was discovered and characterized by Salyers and colleagues and has recently been reviewed (Martens et al., 2009a). The Sus system includes four proteins, which are anchored on the outer leaflet of the outer membrane (SusDEFG) (Shipman et al., 2000), and a TonB-dependent receptor protein (SusC) (Reeves et al., 1997), which spans the outer membrane and couples oligosaccharide transport to the proton motive force. Four of these proteins (SusCDEF) are involved in the cellular attachment to starch (Shipman et al., 2000), and SusG exhibits α-amylase activity but is not essential for starch binding (Shipman et al., 1999). Despite the observation that SusG is not essential for starch binding by B. thetaiotaomicron, recent crystallo-graphic analysis of this enzyme has revealed the presence of two previously undetected carbohydrate binding sites, including a CBM 58 and a secondary surface starch binding site (Koropatkin and Smith, 2010). Two additional proteins, SusA and SusB, are located within the periplasm (Shipman et al., 2000) and have neopullulanase and α-glucosidase activities (D'Elia and Salyers, 1996a), which are involved in the degradation of starch oligosaccharides. Expression of the sus genes is controlled at the transcriptional level by SusR (D'Elia and Salyers, 1996b) and MalR (Cho et al., 2001), and deletion of both of these genes completely attenuates the expression of starch utilization genes (Cho et al., 2001). The Sus system therefore requires only a single extracellular endo-acting enzyme (SusG) that is closely associated with the outer membrane transport apparatus (SusCD). Through this close interaction, oligosaccharides that are released from long starch polymers can be immediately sequestered into the periplasm, where they are further degraded into monosaccharides by SusA and SusB for subsequent transport into the cytoplasm, the site for fermentation. This mechanism minimizes the loss of monosaccharides to other bacteria within the colon and represents an evolutionary adaptation that permits the Bacteroides spp. to effectively compete in the human colonic ecosystem.Recently, a number of genome sequences for Prevotella spp. and Bacteroides spp. have been made available through the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) (Turn-baugh et al., 2007) as well as the North American Consortium for Genomics of Fibrolytic Rumen Bacteria (Morrison et al., 2009; Purushe et al., 2010). These genome sequences have revealed that gut associated Bacteroidetes possess an expansive repertoire of genes predicted to encode carbohydrate active enzymes (Nelson et al., 2010). Furthermore, both the human colonic Bacteroides spp. and the rumen Prevotella spp. exhibit a greatly expanded set of starch utilization system homologues, specifically homologues for SusC and SusD (Xu et al., 2003; 2007; Martens et al., 2009a). Many of these SusC- and SusD-like genes cluster in the genome with genes that are predicted to be involved in the metabolism of various polysaccharides. This observation suggests that the SusC- and SusD-like genes have expanded through gene duplication and then diverged to participate in the utilization of various dietary and host-derived polysaccharides (Martens et al., 2009a).In B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, approximately 88 polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) (Bjursell et al., 2006) that contain genes encoding SusC/SusD homologues as well as putative carbohydrate active enzymes are present. The proteins encoded by the genes at these loci are predicted to play roles in the metabolism of host-derived as well as dietary polysaccharides. Deletion of the five regulatory genes, which control the expression of PULs associated with mucin O-glycan utilization in B. thetaiotaomicron, resulted in impairment of persistence in mice as well as mother to pup transmission of these bacteria (Martens et al., 2008). These studies revealed that degradation of host-derived saccharides by these PULs, which contain one SusC/SusD gene pair per locus, is important for the persistence of these bacteria in vivo. A recent functional genomics study of the rumen bacterium, P. bryantii B14 revealed that an operon of six genes including two tandem repeats of SusC/SusD homologues were the most highly induced genes during growth with soluble wheat arabinoxylan relative to the component monosaccharides, xylose and arabinose (Dodd et al., 2010a) (Fig. 2A). The xylan-specific induction coupled with the high conservation of this cluster among other xylanolytic Bacteroidetes indicates that these genes are important for xylan utilization, thus they are termed members of the xylan utilization system (Xus). The two repeats of SusC and SusD homologues (xusA, xusB, xusC, xusD) are followed by a hypothetical protein encoding gene (xusE), and then followed by an endoxylanase encoding gene (xyn10C). The function of XusE is unknown; however the presence of an N-terminal signal peptidase II cleavage site supports the prediction that this protein is anchored onto the outside leaflet of the outer membrane. The gene xyn10C encodes a GH family 10 endoxylanase (Flint et al., 1997), which is interrupted by a carbohydrate binding module (CBM) family 4 that is homologous to the CBM 4 domain in Xyn10A from Rhodothermus marinus (Simpson et al., 2002). Furthermore, this protein possesses an N-terminal signal peptidase II cleavage site similar to XusE, which indicates that this protein may also be anchored on the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. Thus, Xyn10C may represent a functional homologue of the B. thetaiotaomicron SusG protein, catalysing the extracellular cleavage of xylan polymers to oligosaccha-rides that may be subsequently transported into the cell (Fig. 2B).Model for the xylan utilization system in xylanolytic Bacteroidetes.A. RNAseq coverage map of the major xylan utilization system in P. bryantii B14 during growth on soluble wheat arabinoxylan (WAX, red line) or a mixture of xylose and arabinose (XA, green line). Total RNA was extracted from P. bryantii B14 cultured on either growth substrate (WAX or XA), and then rRNA was subtracted and the enriched mRNA was converted to cDNA. The cDNA was directly sequenced by Illumina technology and individual sequence reads were assembled onto the genome sequence of P. bryantii B14. These data are derived from Dodd et al. (2010a).B. Predicted model for binding of xylan, cleavage and transport of xylan fragments across the outer membrane by components of the Xus cluster in P. bryantii B14. The proteins, XusA and XusC, are homologues of the SusC TonB-dependent receptor, which is involved in oligosaccharide transport across the outer membrane in B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482. XusB and XusD are homologues of B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 SusD, which binds polysaccharides on the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. XusE has no homology to other characterized proteins, but the presence of an N-terminal signal peptidase II cleavage site in this protein suggests that it is tethered to the outer leaflet of the outermembrane. Xyn10C is an endoxylanase gene that also possesses a putative N-terminal signal peptidase cleavage II site. In the predicted model, XusE, Xyn10C and the XusB/D proteins bind to extracellular xylan polymers. Xyn10C then catalyses the endo-cleavage of these polymers and XusB/D facilitate transport of these fragments across the outer membrane and into the periplasm through the TonB-dependent receptors XusA and XusC.The presence of Sus homologues in this gene cluster and the fact that these genes are highly induced during growth on xylan indicates that this gene cluster is adapted to the acquisition of energy from xylan polysaccharides. This gene cluster represents a specific example of the Sus paradigm for nutrient acquisition, which is common among many environmental as well as gut-associated organisms within the phylum Bacteroidetes (Martens et al., 2009a). Analysis of the genome sequences for several Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp. revealed that this cluster of genes is highly conserved among Bacteroidetes members that are known to be xylanolytic (Dodd et al., 2010a). Moreover, this gene cluster is present in several members of the phylum Bacteroidetes that have not been assessed for the ability to degrade xylan (data not shown), and this may be predictive of their potential to degrade this polymer. These observations are highly suggestive that xylan degradation is relatively wide-spread among the human-associated Bacteroides and Prevotella spp.The Xus genes described above may comprise the core, conserved set of genes required for extracellular outer membrane-associated binding of xylan and transport of xylan fragments by gut-associated Bacteroidetes. However, due to the structural complexity of xylans, additional enzymes are required to breakdown this substrate into fermentable monosaccharides (Fig. 3A). The availability of genomic sequences in the publicly available databases provides us with resources to examine how well-equipped members of the phylum Bacteroidetes are to completely release the fermentable sugars from complex hemicelluloses. The molecular scissors required for degradation of these complex polysaccharides likely derive from glycoside hydrolase (GH) enzyme families. The GH enzymes are grouped into different families based on their three-dimensional folds and their catalytic mechanisms (Cantarel et al., 2009). Within many GH families, the protein domain represents a scaffold in which different substrate specificities may evolve, provided that the correct positioning of catalytic residues is maintained. Although bioinformatic approaches are largely successful at assigning GH genes into appropriate families, attempting to infer substrate specificity and thus physiological function by sequence alone represents a significant challenge.Presence of carbohydrate active enzymes associated with xylan degradation in Bacteroidetes genomes that possess a Xus gene cluster.A. The general structure for xylan is shown and the relevant glycoside hydrolase (GH) enzymes are indicated. Only the GH families that are present within the genome sequences of Xus-containing Bacteroidetes are shown.B. Frequency distribution plot for the GH families from panel A in xylanolytic Bacteroidetes. For GH 5, only those members with high homology [expect (E) value < 1 × 10−15] to the Bacteroidetes-specific endoxylanase enzymes identified by Dodd et al. (2010a) are included. With the exception of Prevotella ruminicola 23, which has a complete genome, all numbers of genes are estimates based on the analysis of data from partially sequenced genomes. Analyses were performed by identifying a biochemically verified member from each GH family on the CAZy website, and using it as a query for a BLASTp search of the listed bacterial genome. Only those results that exhibited E-values < 1 × 10−5 were included.This is particularly relevant to the saccharolytic gut Bacteroidetes whose genomes exhibit a highly expanded repertoire of glycolytic enzymes. Many of these bacterial genomes contain multiple copies of members of a particular GH family and this raises the important question of whether these genes code for enzymes with redundant activities or whether each of these genes encodes an enzyme with a unique functional role within the cell. GH enzymes with similar biochemical activities may derive from different families and the major xylanolytic enzymes are classified as follows: endoxylanases (GH 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 43), β-xylosidases (GH 3, 39, 43, 52, 54), α-l-arabinofuranosidases (GH 3, 43, 51, 54, 62) and α-glucuronidases (GH 67, 115). Bacteroidetes members that harbour a Xus gene cluster also possess a large number of genes that derive from these families (Fig. 3B). The most highly represented families include GH family 3 and GH family 43, with Bacteroides intestinalis DSM 17393 possessing 32 GH family 3 genes and 22 GH family 43 genes. Metagenomic studies have also confirmed that these two families are among the most abundant microbiota-specific GH families (Gill et al., 2006).The question then arises; are any of these GH3 or GH43 genes involved with xylan degradation, and if so, how many? A recent study addressed this question by evaluating the role of four GH family 3 genes in P. bryantii B14. Each of these genes was cloned, expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli, and the biochemical properties were evaluated with a range of oligo- and polysaccharides. These studies revealed that one of the proteins (CdxA) has β-glucosidase and cellodextrinase activities, whereas the three remaining GH3 enzymes (Xyl3A, Xyl3B and Xyl3C) each possesses β-xylosidase activity (Dodd et al., 2010b). Furthermore, transcriptional analysis of P. bryantii B14 revealed that expression of xyl3A was induced during growth on arabinoxylan relative to glucose, whereas the expression of xyl3B and xyl3C was constitutive. Analysis of enzymatic activity with substituted xylo-oligosaccharides revealed that Xyl3C exhibits a different cleavage pattern during the hydrolysis of 4-O-methyl glucuronyl substituted xylo-oligosaccharides relative to Xyl3B, suggesting a fundamental difference in substrate specificity between these enzymes. These results provide evidence that these three β-xylosidases possess different transcriptional and biochemical profiles and support the prediction that each enzyme fulfils a unique role in xylan degradation within the cell.The findings above have important consequences for analysing the metabolic potential of the gut microbiota and suggest that many glycolytic enzymes have evolved not only to cleave a specific chemical linkage, but also to recognize the structural context in which the linkage occurs. This added layer of complexity represents a considerable limitation to our ability to correctly assign functions of GH enzymes using bioinformatics alone. Emphasis should therefore be placed on studies that incorporate functional genomics as well as detailed biochemical approaches for assigning functions to glycolytic enzymes.The genome sequence of B. intestinalis DSM 17393 harbours eight different putative endoxylanase genes, six from GH family 10 and two biochemically verified GH family 5 endoxylanases (Dodd et al., 2010a) (Fig. 4). All of these genes exhibit unique domain architecture, which indicates that these proteins may serve different functions. This is the first evidence of a human gut bacterium with such an impressive arsenal of endoxylanase enzymes that are linked to such a variety of catalytic domains and carbohydrate binding modules. Furthermore, six of these eight proteins possess putative signal peptidase II cleavage sites, suggesting that the cell surface of this bacterium is decorated with a number of different endoxylanase enzymes during xylan metabolism. Several of these endoxylanase genes encode GH10 catalytic modules that are interrupted with CBM4 domains and this may influence the substrate specificity of these enzymes. Indeed, Flint and colleagues identified different xylo-oligosaccharide product distribution profiles for Xyn10A (no CBM domain) and Xyn10C (putative CBM4 domain) cloned from P. bryantii B14 when incubated with intact xylans. Xyn10A produced shorter xylo-oligosaccharide products (Gasparic et al., 1995b), whereas Xyn10C produced longer xylo-oligosaccharides (Flint et al., 1997), indicating that the domain architecture for these proteins may influence product distribution profiles. Taken together, these observations suggest that each of the B. intestinalis DSM 17393 endoxylanases possess distinct substrate specificities or product distribution profiles and collectively, this large number of enzymes may improve the digestibility of a wide variety of xylans from different dietary sources.Expansion of xylanase enzymes in the genome of Bacteroides intestinalis DSM 17393. Putative GH family 10 xylanase enzymes were identified in the B. intestinalis genome using P. bryantii B14 Xyn10A (Gasparic et al., 1995b) as a query in a BLASTp search of the genome. Domain architectures were predicted using the Conserved Domains Database (CDD) on the NCBI website (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2007). Domains were included if the E-value was less than 1 × 10−5. The two biochemically verified (Dodd et al., 2010a) GH 5 endoxylanases from B. intestinalis DSM 17393 are also included and indicated by asterisks (BACINT_01125 and BACINT_04213). Signal peptides and lipoprotein signal sequences were predicted using SignalP v3.0 (Emanuelsson et al., 2007) and LipoP v1.0 (Juncker et al., 2003) respectively. N.S., no significant match to any domain within the CD database.Of the xylan degrading Bacteroidetes described to date, the xylanolytic system of the rumen bacterium P. bryantii B14 is the best studied. This bacterium grows efficiently on soluble xylan fragments (Miyazaki et al., 1997; 2005) and responds at the transcriptional level to medium to large-sized xylan fragments via the HTCS regulator, XynR (Miyazaki et al., 2003). This HTCS regulator is also conserved in the genomes of all other xylanolytic Bacteroidetes that contain Xus clusters.The XynR of P. bryantii B14 is a large protein of about 1369 amino acids and contains multiple domains, including a putative periplasmic sensing region as well as all of the signal transduction machinery required to initiate a transcriptional response to an environmental signal. XynR possesses three putative transmembrane helices, which predict that the N-terminal residues 21–750 are periplasmic and the C-terminal residues 770–1336 are cytoplasmic, while the final 12 amino acids are either membrane associated or periplasmic. There are many protein sequences, which exhibit homology to the N-terminal periplasmic region of XynR in the GenBank database. Most of the homologous proteins derive from gut-associated Bacteroidetes. However, none of these proteins has demonstrated function. The N-terminal periplasmic region is grouped within the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) of proteins number 3292, which according to the NCBI Conserved Domains Database (CDD) contains approximately 3854 members. No domain hits exist within the Pfam database, and a BLASTp search of the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) retrieved no significant hits.Recently, the periplasmic sensing domain for an HTCS that controls expression of a fructan utilization locus in B. thetaiotaomicron (BT1754) was crystallized and shown to bind to the monosaccharide, fructose, which is the end-product of fructan degradation (Sonnenburg et al., 2010). While the C-terminal region of XynR, which contains the histidine kinase and response regulator elements, shares high amino acid sequence identity with the C-terminal region of BT1754, the N-terminal periplasmic regions of these proteins are not related. This observation suggests a fundamental difference in the sensing mechanism between these two proteins. It is unlikely that XynR binds to monomeric xylan degradation products, as previous studies revealed that induction of xylanase activity is unaffected by xylose, arabinose or glucuronic acid. Xylanase activity was rather specifically induced in the presence of medium to large xylan fragments (Miyazaki et al., 2005). It is possible that the periplasmic region of XynR binds directly to xylan fragments that are transported into the periplasmic space. However, previous data indicate that xylanase induction is low even in the presence of xylo-oligosaccharides with degree of polymerization (DP) up to five, and that substitutions on the xylan chain are not critical for xylanase induction (Miyazaki et al., 1997; 2005). Therefore to initiate signalling, the transported xylan fragments would have to be rather large. It is currently unknown whether xylan fragments of sufficient size can be transported across the outer membrane via XusA or XusC, and if transported, whether periplasmic degradation by constitutively expressed β-xylosidase enzymes might precede the recognition of these fragments by XynR. Another possibility is that extracellular engagement of xylan fragments by the outer membrane associated Xus apparatus may initiate a signalling event that is transmitted to the periplasmic region of XynR through a protein–protein interaction. This could potentially be mediated through one of the two TonB-dependent receptors, XusA or XusC, which are predicted to possess periplasmic N-terminal amino acid extensions. Indeed, it has been shown that TonB-dependent receptors in the related bacterium, B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, transduce signals from the outside of the cell into the cytoplasm via protein–protein interactions between the N-terminal region of TonB-dependent receptor domain and an anti-σ factor (Fig. 5A) (Martens et al., 2009b). For the prototypical E. coli Fec system, this trans-membrane signalling leads to a conformational change in the cytoplasmic region of the inner membrane spanning anti-σ factor causing release of the ECF-σ factor, which then potentiates an appropriate transcriptional response (Braun and Mahren, 2005). While a similar protein–protein interaction between the periplasmic region of XynR and the N-terminal region of XusA or XusC would be a very interesting paradigm for transcriptional control of xylan degrading genes in the Bacteroidetes (Fig. 5B), future studies will need to be performed to evaluate this hypothesis.Model for signal transduction in gut Bacteroidetes.A. Mechanism revealed by Martens et al., (2009b) for trans-envelope signalling in response to mucin oligosaccharide degradation by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482. Mucin oligosaccharides engage a TonB-dependent receptor, which releases the N-terminal plug domain of the receptor. The N-terminal extension of the TonB receptor is then able to interact with the sensor domain of an anti-σ factor. This interaction causes the anti-σ to release the ECF-σ that was being sequestered in the cytoplasm and is now free to induce the transcription of mucin utilization genes.B. Potential model for xylan signal recognition involving XusC/D and XynR. Extracellular xylan fragments engage the TonB-dependent receptors XusC and/or XusD and this triggers release of the N-terminal plug domain of the receptor. The N-terminal extension of XusC/D is then able to interact with the sensor domain of XynR. An unknown signalling cascade, probably involving the histidine kinase (H and HK) and response regulator (D and HTH) domains, activates the C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain of XynR, allowing it to bind to regulatory elements and thus inducing transcription of xylan utilization genes.Of particular note, the transcription of several genes involved in the utilization of chondroitin sulfate by B. thetaiotaomicron VPI5482 is induced by oligosaccharides with DP of eight or higher (Salyers and Kotarski, 1980). This system also contains an HTCS that is homologous to XynR (27% amino acid identity over entire polypeptide sequence). Therefore, there may be parallels between these two systems in their mode of regulation. Irrespective of how the signal is sensed, these data clearly suggest that P. bryantii B14 (and by extension other XynR-containing Bacteroidetes) has evolved an elaborate mechanism for specifically recognizing the intact structure of xylan. This is of particular physiological significance in the gut environment because polysaccharides from various plant sources or tissues, such as arabinan and xyloglucan, contain arabinose or xylose in linkages that are inaccessible to xylanolytic enzyme systems. Thus sensing intact β-1,4-linked xylan fragments ensures that the ensuing transcriptional response is appropriate and only those enzymes required for efficient utilization of xylan are produced.Recent genome sequencing of xylanolytic gut bacteria has provided unprecedented insight into the mechanisms that members of the Bacteroidetes phylum might employ to harvest energy from xylan. Although yet to be fully investigated, the xylan degrading systems of these gut bacteria promise to be much more complex than previously envisaged. Furthermore, the molecular machinery used to capture energy from xylan is analogous to the Sus-like paradigm, which is common to other glycan assimilating pathways in these organisms (Martens et al., 2009a). In addition to providing an immense wealth of information to the scientific community, it is also clear that the genome sequences of the gut Bacteroidetes have raised many more questions than answers. Thus, there are several unresolved issues, especially with respect to xylan utilization and an elaboration is provided below.How do certain Prevotella spp. metabolize xylose in the apparent absence of a xylose isomerase gene? This is an important question that is fundamental to our basic understanding of microbial fermentation by these gut bacteria. There are two major pathways for xylose utilization, the xylose isomerase pathway, which is common among bacteria, and the redox pathway, which is common among eukaryotes (Jeffries, 2006). In the bacterial pathway, xylose is first converted to xylulose by the action of xylose isomerase (E.C. 5.3.1.5) and then xylulokinase (E.C. 2.7.1.17) phosphorylates xylulose to produce xylulose-5-phosphate, which may enter the pentose phosphate pathway. Of the xylanolytic gut Bacteroidetes sequenced to date, most possess a conserved gene cluster containing a xylulokinase gene followed by a xylose isomerase gene (Fig. 6, lower half of figure). In contrast, four recently sequenced Bacteroidetes members are apparently missing the xylose isomerase gene from this cluster (Fig. 6, upper half of figure). These organisms include the rumen bacteria, P. bryantii B14, P. ruminicola 23 and the human-associated bacteria, Prevotella copri DSM 18205 and Prevotella oris C735. The genome sequence for P. ruminicola 23 is complete or closed, whereas the genomes for P. bryantii, P. copri and P. oris are only partially sequenced. Analysis of the region immediately downstream of the xylulokinase gene for these three partially sequenced organisms revealed no large gaps in the DNA sequence, indicating the absence of a xylose isomerase gene. This observation suggests that these four Prevotella spp. exhibit a fundamental difference in the genomic organization of xylose-metabolizing genes compared with other Bacteroidetes (Fig. 5). BLASTp searches of the genome sequences for these four bacteria using the xylose isomerase from B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 (BT_0793) as a query returned no significant matches. Further analyses of the genome sequence of these bacteria did not yield any candidate xylose reductase or xylitol dehydrogenase genes, indicating that the eukaryotic redox pathway is not at play in these bacteria.Genomic organization of xylulokinase genes from selected human or bovine-associated Bacteroidetes. The Prevotella bryantii B14 xylulokinase gene (GenBank accession no. {""type"":""entrez-protein"",""attrs"":{""text"":""EFI71375.1"",""term_id"":""299774761"",""term_text"":""EFI71375.1""}}EFI71375.1) was used as the query sequence in a BLASTp search of the GenBank database. Next, the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 xylose isomerase gene (BT_0793) was used as a query sequence in a BLASTp search of the GenBank database. The four organisms that possess only a xylulose kinase gene and no xylose isomerase gene are grouped in the upper half of the figure, and representative organisms that contain both genes are grouped in the lower half. The genomic context is shown for the region surrounding the xylulose kinase genes in these organisms. ORF numbers are indicated within each of the genes as derived from the genome project for each organism in the GenBank database. The small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA genes from the organisms were aligned and a neighbour-joining tree was constructed using the CLC Genomics Workbench v3.0 software. Each alignment was re-sampled 100 times and the bootstrap values are indicated on the internal branches. The branch length is reported as the expected number of substitutions per nucleotide position. The rumen isolates are in pink and the human isolates are colour-coded as indicated in the legend based upon the reported body isolation site as listed in the Human Microbiome Projects Catalog (http://www.hmpdacc.org/).Xylose isomerase activity, although detected in cell extracts of xylose-grown P. bryantii B14 and P. ruminicola 23 cultures, was very low as compared with cell extracts of E. coli strain LE 392, whereas xylulokinase activity was robust and inducible in these two Prevotella strains during growth with xylose as compared with glucose (Matte et al., 1992). Do these bacteria employ a unique mechanism for the conversion of xylose to xylulose? Perhaps there is another isomerase enzyme that has evolved to moonlight as a xylose isomerase enzyme in these bacteria. Whichever the case, the genomic data provide support that these Prevotella spp. possess a fundamental difference in their xylose utilization system as compared with related bacteria within the Bacteroidetes phylum.Another fundamental question, which arises from these genome sequences, is whether or not xylan degradation in the human colon is a physiologically important process that contributes to the maintenance and population dynamics of the microbial community in this ecosystem. The presence of numerous bacteria, which possess extensive xylan degrading systems as well as an even larger presence of xylo-oligosaccharide fermenting bacteria, would suggest that xylan utilization is important. Our increased understanding of the Xus system coupled with the genetic tools that are available for xylanolytic Bacteroides spp. will allow this question to be answered by constructing mutant bacteria, which have genetic lesions in their xylan utilizing systems and then to test whether these mutations affect their fitness and transmissibility in vivo.This research was supported by the Energy Biosciences Institute.

PMC6259741,Chemical Arsenal for the Study of O-GlcNAc,False,"The concepts of both protein glycosylation and cellular signaling have been influenced by O-linked-β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification (O-GlcNAcylation) on the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues. Unlike conventional protein glycosylation, O-GlcNAcylation is localized in the nucleocytoplasm and its cycling is a dynamic process that operates in a highly regulated manner in response to various cellular stimuli. These characteristics render O-GlcNAcylation similar to phosphorylation, which has long been considered a major regulatory mechanism in cellular processes. Various efficient chemical approaches and novel mass spectrometric (MS) techniques have uncovered numerous O-GlcNAcylated proteins that are involved in the regulation of many important cellular events. These discoveries imply that O-GlcNAcylation is another major regulator of cellular signaling. However, in contrast to phosphorylation, which is regulated by hundreds of kinases and phosphatases, dynamic O-GlcNAc cycling is catalyzed by only two enzymes: uridine diphospho-N-acetyl-glucosamine:polypeptide β-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (OGT) and β-D-N-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA). Many useful chemical tools have recently been used to greatly expand our understanding of the extensive crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation and hence of cellular signaling. This review article describes the various useful chemical tools that have been developed and discusses the considerable advances made in the O-GlcNAc field.Until the mid 1980s, glycosylation was thought to occur on the cell surface proteins and luminal face of secreted proteins, rather than on nuclear and cytosolic proteins. In 1984, a new localization of glycosylation was first observed during studies designed to detect terminal O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on the surfaces of living lymphocytes [1]. This glycosylation predominantly occurs on proteins within the nucleus and cytoplasm. The structure of this new glycosylation found on nucleocytoplasmic proteins was identified as the single O-GlcNAc. Unlike conventional glycosylation occurring within the secretory pathway, this new type of intracellular glycosylation has the following three unique features: (1) It occurs exclusively on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, rather than on the extracellular and luminal localization; (2) It is generally not elongated to more complex structures; (3) It is a dynamic modification. It can be removed from and reinstalled on the polypeptides more rapidly than the protein is turned over [2,3] and its cycling “on and off” is in response to different physiological stimuli, such as nutrients, hormones, growth factors, and stress [4,5,6,7]. This stimuli-responsive dynamic nature of O-GlcNAc modification, which has been termed “O-GlcNAcylation”, resembles phosphorylation, which is a common posttranslational modification (PTM) of nuclear and cytosolic proteins. Although these two PTMs share similar properties, they are regulated very differently. Phosphorylation is regulated by over 500 kinases and 140 phosphatases [8], whereas only two enzymes are involved in the regulation of O-GlcNAc cycling in humans. These two enzymes are a glycosyltransferase termed as O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) [9,10,11] and a glycoside hydrolase termed as O-GlcNAcase (OGA or formally known as hexosaminidase C [Hex C]) [12,13]. OGT installs the sugar moiety (GlcNAc) on target proteins using the uridine5’-diphosphate (UDP)-GlcNAc substrate which is a high-energy metabolite synthesized via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) (Figure 1). A reverse enzyme, OGA returns glycosylated proteins to their unmodified state by catalyzing the removal of O-GlcNAc. The level of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and the extent of protein GlcNAcylation appear to be sensitive to nutrient (i.e., glucose, glucosamine and fatty acid) availability [5,14,15].The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).Interestingly, proteins known to be modified with O-GlcNAc can also be phosphorylated, which implies a dynamic interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation [16]. In some proteins, O-GlcNAc competes with phosphate for the same site and results in the change of the activity or stability of the proteins. For example, the Ser16 residue of estrogen receptor β (ER-β) can be modified both with O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate in a reciprocal manner [17,18,19]. This site of ER-β is within a region that is related to protein degradation. Site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that the phosphorylation of ER-β at this site increases the transcriptional activity, but induces rapid degradation, while O-GlcNAcylation at Ser16 increases its stability, but decreases its transcriptional activity [18]. Another example of reciprocal interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation at the same residue can be found in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) [20]. eNOS is reciprocally modified with O-GlcNAc and phosphate at Ser1177. Phosphorylation of eNOS by protein kinase B (PKB or AKT) at this site activates the enzyme and positively regulates penile erection. However, in diabetic patients, O-GlcNAcylation at Ser1177 prevents activation of eNOS by AKT, which contributes to erectile dysfunction [20].In some cases, O-GlcNAc and phosphate modification occur at proximal sites in the reciprocal relationship. An example is the tumor suppressor p53 [21], which contains two modification sites at Ser149 and Thr155 for O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, respectively, and shows a reciprocal relationship between these two proximal sites. O-GlcNAcylation of p53 at Ser149 reduces the phosphorylation of the nearby site (Thr155), which subsequently prevents the interaction between Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and p53, a prerequisite for proteasomal degradation.Therefore, an increase in O-GlcNAcylation of p53 at Ser149 reduces p53 ubiquitination and thereby stabilizes the protein p53 [21]. The second example of proximal site competition can be found in calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV). This enzyme has several O-GlcNAcylated and phosphorylated sites and regulates downstream protein activities in response to the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations [22]. Phosphorylation of CaMKIV at Thr200 increases its kinase enzymatic activity, but O-GlcNAcylation at Ser189 results in a reciprocal decrease of its phosphorylation at Thr200 and inhibits the enzyme activity. Structural analysis revealed that this O-GlcNAc site is located within the adenosine triphosphate binding region of the enzyme [22]. In addition to the reciprocal relationship between these two modifications at the same or proximal sites of the proteins discussed above, they also exhibit an interplay among distantly located sites on proteins such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). When phosphorylation occurs on several specific serine residues (Ser307, 612, 632/635), it has a negative effect on insulin signaling, whereas phosphorylation on Ser302 and Ser629 positively regulates insulin signaling [23]. O-GlcNAcylation sites of IRS-1 are found in distantly located regions such as Ser914, Ser1009, Ser1036, Ser1041 and the global increase in O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to exert a negative regulatory effect on insulin signaling [24,25]. These observations suggest that these two PTMs on IRS-1 affect each other’s regulation both reciprocally and synergistically. It is now believed that protein O-GlcNAcylation participates in many fundamental aspects of cellular homeostasis such as cell signaling, mRNA transcription, and protein stability [26,27] and acts as a common cellular regulator by interacting with O-phosphorylation reciprocally or synergistically [28,29,30]. Dysregulation of O-GlcNAc cycling has been related to various diseases, including diabetes [24,31,32], cancer [21,33] and neurodegenerative disorders [34,35]. The roles of nutrient responsive O-GlcNAc cycling in the embryonic development and epigenetic programming of developmental fate have also emerged [36]. Since its first discovery, a variety of methods that detect and modulate O-GlcNAc cycling has been developed [37,38,39,40,41]. Armed with these tools, the diverse set of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins have been identified [42] and the functional roles of O-GlcNAc cycling have matured. This review highlights recent advances in the development of useful chemical tools that have been applied to elucidate the molecular basis of biological processes in which O-GlcNAc participates. The chemical tools designed for O-GlcNAc proteomics and the monitoring of the activities of enzymes involved in O-GlcNAc cycling. Since the inhibitors of these enzymes have been described in the two most recent review articles [43,44], the topic of enzyme inhibitors is briefly discussed.The major impediment to determining the molecular mechanistic roles of O-GlcNAc in specific signaling cascades and in transcriptional regulation has been the lack of sensitive and easy-to-use tools for identifying O-GlcNAcylated proteins and site localization. Mapping the modification site(s), however, is a particularly challenging task due to its two special characteristics: (1) The stoichiometry of O-GlcNAc modification at each site on proteins is usually low; (2) The glycosidic linkage between the GlcNAc moiety and Ser/Thr is chemically and enzymatically labile. In early studies, mapping O-GlcNAc site(s) of the protein began with the purification of the target protein. GlcNAc moieties of the purified protein were then enzymatically tagged with radiolabeled galactose using radiolabeled UDP-Gal and bovine milk β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT1) [1]. The radiolabeled proteins were subject to proteolysis resulting in a mixture of tryptic peptides. The tryptic peptides that contain radioactivity were purified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Then the purified peptide sequence was determined by automated Edman degradation and the residue containing the radioactivity was elucidated by manual Edman degradation [45]. Although several O-GlcNAc sites of some proteins such as neurofilament H [46], L and M [47], estrogen receptor [48,49], and synapsin I [50] have been mapped using this method, this method has two drawbacks: (1) The whole process consists of many time-consuming steps containing several rounds of HPLC purification and Edman degradation steps for identification of modification sites; (2) Due to the low detection limits of radiolabeled galactose, this method needs large amounts of expensive radioactive sugar nucleotide.Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis has been applied to identify many O-GlcNAcylated proteins. However, determination of the site modification remains difficult due to the labile property of the glycosidic linkage between Ser/Thr residues of peptides and O-GlcNAc, as mentioned before. The O-GlcNAc moiety falls off from the peptide/protein in a mass spectrometer upon fragmentation by standard collision-induced dissociation (CID) or collision-activated dissociation (CAD), resulting in the loss of any site information. Furthermore, in MS, if a small portion of unmodified peptidesco-exist, unmodified peptides are preferentially ionized, which suppresses the signal of the glycopeptides. As stated above, proteins known to be modified with O-GlcNAc are not usually 100% glycosylated. Therefore, peptides generated from a protein sample are mostly in the unmodified state, which can severely suppress the signal of the corresponding O-GlcNAcylated peptides. Thus, it is necessary to isolate or enrich O-GlcNAcylated proteins/peptides from other non-glycosylated species. Several enrichment strategies that allow for the efficient isolation of molecules of interest from other species have been developed. A general approach for the O-GlcNAc proteomic study includes three steps: (1) Detection and enrichment of O-GlcNAcylated proteins; (2) Identification of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins; (3) Identification of the modification site(s).The simplest biological approaches for O-GlcNAc enrichment utilize either O-GlcNAc antibodies or O-GlcNAc-binding lectin, which can be conjugated to an epitope tag for visualization and forsolid-phase-based purification [51,52,53]. Two O-GlcNAc antibodies are commonly used: RL2 [54], which is produced against the nuclear pore protein complex fraction, and carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) 110.6 [55], which is produced against the synthetic O-GlcNAcylated peptide based on the RNAP II CTD. However, the binding affinity of antibodies to O-GlcNAc is relatively low, which prevents the stringent washing conditions required for reducing nonspecific interactions. Commonly used O-GlcNAc binding lectin is wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA). However, WGA is not specific for a particular sugar. It can bind not only O-GlcNAc monosaccharide but also oligosaccharides containing terminal N-acetylglucosamine or chitobiose. Furthermore, WGA binds weakly to monosaccharide O-GlcNAc. Therefore, the use of these probes suffers from the contamination with nonspecific binding partners. In addition, since all of these probes bind preferentially with high abundance proteins or those with multiple clustered O-GlcNAc residues, the detection and isolation of low abundance proteins with single O-GlcNAc are often elusive. Indeed, these probes failed to detect the O-GlcNAc moiety onα-crystallin that has only one modification site [56,57] and has low stoichiometry of glycosylation (<10%) [56,57,58]. Nevertheless, using WGA lectin-based enrichment approach in combination with MS techniques a number of new proteins involved in synaptic transmission have been identified [52,59].Metabolic carbohydrate engineering strategies have been developed as complementary methods to biological antibody/lectin-based enrichment approaches. These strategies were originated by Reutter et al. to engineer the cell surface carbohydrates [60,61]. In these approaches, slightly modified monosaccharide containing a specific functional group termed as “chemical handle” is used as an alternative substrate to natural sugar substrate. This unnatural monosaccharide is taken up by the cells and incorporated into the cellular glycoconjugates by the biosynthetic machinery of the cell. Ketone [62,63], azide [64,65,66,67], and thiol [68] functional groups have been used as the chemical handles to metabolically label glycoproteins in mammalian cells (Figure 2a).Metabolic labeling carbohydrate-based enrichment strategies: (a) chemical handles can be displayed on the glycoproteins; (b) these chemical handles can be chemoselectively ligated to the appropriate epitope tags;and (c) by the epitopes-conjugates interactions, labeled glycoproteins can be isolated and enriched.Once incorporated into cellular glycoconjugates, the chemical handle can be ligated to either a visualization tag or an enrichment tag through chemoselective reaction between the chemical handle and an appropriate reagent probe [69,70]. The ketone moiety is reactive to amino groups such as aminoxy or hydrazide reagent. The azide group can selectively react with a terminal alkyne-containing reagent or with a phosphine reagent, whereas the thiol moiety readily reacts with the disulfide-bridged reagent or maleimide reagent. Among these chemical handles, the azide moiety has proved to be one of the most useful chemical handles since it satisfies the following requirement of bioorthogonality: It is absent from biological systems and is unreactive with endogenous biological functional groups. However, it has unique reactivity with phosphine- and alkyne-based probes [71] as mentioned before. Furthermore, its small size induces minimum perturbation of substrate structure and it is stable within cellular glycoconjugates. The most commonly employed bioorthogonal reactions with azides include the Staudinger ligation [64] with phosphine probes, and the copper (I)-catalyzed cycloaddition with terminal alkyne probes (click chemistry) [72,73]. More recently copper-free click chemistry has been developed [74,75]. Unlike the conventional click chemistry labeling method, this new method does not require a cytotoxic metal catalyst because alkyne generated in situ is highly strained enough to promote rapid cycloaddition with azide to form a stable triazole conjugate (Figure 2b). Using these methods, azido-labeled biomolecules can be covalently ligated to the appropriate reagents having epitope tags [70,76] such as the FLAG peptide, biotin, or hexahistidine (His6). Utilizing these epitope tags, azide-labeled biomolecules can be detected and enriched by the use of anti-FLAG antibody, streptavidin, or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) derivative conjugate, respectively (Figure 2c) [69,70,77]. Due to its very strong affinity for streptavidin, biotin has been chosen as the most popular epitope tag for detection and affinity purification. This strong biotin-streptavidin interaction can tolerate harsh washing conditions, allowing the removal of nonspecifically bound materials, thereby minimizing contamination from unmodified peptides and decreasing the ion suppression effect in the MS analysis. In contrast, the other epitope tags are not amenable to such stringent washes.The first O-GlcNAc proteomic study using these metabolic carbohydrate engineering strategies was performed by Vocadlo et al. using azide-containing GlcNAc analog (GlcNAz) to globally characterize O-GlcNAcylated proteins in cells. The general procedure that has been widely used is described as follows (Figure 3). In the first step, cells are incubated with peracetylated GlcNAz. Peracetylation of this unnatural sugar facilitates its uptake by living cells because it is expected to penetrate more efficiently the cell surface membrane due to its hydrophobic nature. Upon its cellular entry, the peracetylated GlcNAz is rapidly deacetylated by intracellular esterases. Then GlcNAz enters the hexosamine salvage pathway just like glucosamine, and is converted into UDP-N-azidoacetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAz). OGT utilizes UDP-GlcNAz and attaches GlcNAz to serine or threonine site(s) of proteins [66]. GlcNAz-labeled proteins are then conjugated to biotinylated phosphine via the Staudinger ligation and the resultant biotinylated proteins are affinity-purified using streptavidin beads. Proteins bound to the beads are digested with trypsin and tryptic peptides are analyzed by MS analysis. The major disadvantage of this metabolic labeling approach is that it can perturb metabolic pathways of cells, and thus the captured glycosylation state of proteins may not be physiologically relevant. In addition, GlcNAz can be incorporated into the cell surface glycoproteins, although the efficiency of its incorporation is low, resulting in a false positive assignment as the O-GlcNAc-modified proteins. Nevertheless, this method has been widely used to globally identify O-GlcNAc-modified proteins ranging from zebrafish [78] to human cancer cells [79].Metabolic labeling of carbohydrate strategies for the global identification of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins.In an attempt to directly characterize physiologically relevant O-GlcNAcylated proteins, the chemoenzymatic approach has been applied. This method uses a genetically engineeredβ-1,4-galactosyl transferase (Y289L GalT mutant) [80,81] and an unnatural UDP-galactose analogue as a sugar-donor substrate that contain a chemical handle such as the azido [82] or ketone moiety [83] to label O-GlcNAcylated proteins/peptides. The enlarged donor-substrate binding pocket of this Y289L GalT mutant enables it to efficiently transfer unnatural galactose to the C-4 hydroxyl group of GlcNAc in glycoproteins/glycopeptides. Once transferred, the azido- or ketone-containing galactose label of GlcNAc can be subjected to chemoselective ligation with a suitable reagent having biotin (Figure 4). Then, the biotin-labeled proteins/peptides can be enriched through streptavidin affinity chromatography and subjected to the MS analysis. Using this approach, several low abundance O-GlcNAcylated proteins (c-Fos, c-Jun, ATF-1, and CBP) and two modification sites on OGT were identified [84].Chemoenzymatic tagging of O-GlcNAc-based enrichment strategies.As noted above, the strong interaction between biotin and streptavidin has made the biotin molecule the most popular epitope tag for the detection and enrichment of molecules of interest. However, their strong binding also exerts a negative effect when the bound biotinylated glycopeptides are eluted from the streptavidin solid support. Harsh conditions are generally required for interrupting the strong interaction between biotin and streptavidin to release the bound glycopeptides from the solid support. However, the use of these harsh conditions can lead to decomposition of the glycopeptides resulting in low product recovery. This problem has recently been tackled by engineering azido-reactive reagents that have an easily cleavable linker between the biotin moiety and the azido-reactive moiety.This strategy is depicted in Figure 5. The same chemoenzymatic attachment approach is applied using UDP-GalNAz and mutant GalT. An engineered reagent consists of three important regions. The azido-reactive chemical region allows for its selective ligation to GalNAz- labeled proteins/peptides. The biotin region of the reagent facilitates enrichment of biotin-GalNAz-labeled proteins/peptides from other unmodified species by exploiting its affinity for streptavidin. Lastly, the readily cleavable linker region allows for the easy release of the isolated proteins/peptides from the solid support. Hart et al. have applied this strategy by using a biotin-photocleavable linker-alkyne reagent [85] which utilizes the ultraviolet light-catalyzed photochemical reaction for the release of the molecules of interest and identified O-GlcNAcylated sites on several neuronal proteins such as tau, synucleins, and methylCpG-binding protein 2 [85].Chemoenzymatic tagging of O-GlcNAc-based enrichment strategieswith the photocleavable reagent.As the O-GlcNAc glycosidic linkage is susceptible to alkali-induced β-elimination, GlcNAc-eliminated peptides/proteins formed by alkali-induced β-elimination, followed by loss of water at Ser/Thr can provide modification site information [86]. Wells et al. have improved this method for easier mapping of the sites of O-GlcNAc modification. In this method, base-catalyzed β-elimination of O-GlcNAc results in α,β-unsaturated carbonyl followed by Michael Addition of a nucleophile such as dithiothreitol (DTT) (termed as “BEMAD”) to label the β-eliminated O-GlcNAc sites [51]. The DTT tag allows for enrichment via thiol-affinity chromatography. Unlike the O-GlcNAc moiety, as the DTT tag does not fall off during standard CID/CAD MS, it can provide the site information. Several O-GlcNAc sites of proteins such as synapsin I, nuclear pore complex proteins, actin, myosin and IRS-1 were mapped by this method [51]. However, the harsh conditions used in the BEMAD method can lead to degradation of peptides and side reactions with unmodified serine and threonine residues [87]. In addition, the inability of this method to differentiate O-GlcNAc from phosphate modification necessitates additional control experiments [88] and confirmation by independent methods.In addition to the development of the enrichment strategies described above, recent advances in the MS field including the novel fragmentation methods make it possible to map O-GlcNAc with relatively small protein samples.The O-GlcNAc glycosidic bond is much weaker than the peptide bond. Therefore, in standard CID/CAD MS, GlcNAc almost always falls off the peptide resulting in the loss of modification site information [56,57,89]. Furthermore, in CID/CAD MS, the O-GlcNAc peptide does not produce sufficient fragment ions, giving poor sequencing information. This arises from the loss of energy associated with the cleavage of the O-glycosidic bond. Recently, electron-capture dissociation (ECD) has been introduced as a new MS/MS fragmentation technique that uses low energy electrons to react with peptide captions in the magnetic field of a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer [90]. Unlike CID/CAD MS, ECD does not necessarily break the weakest bond. In ECD, peptide fragments retain PTMs such as phosphorylation [91,92] and O-GlcNAc [52]. However, the high cost and experimental difficulties have prevented their widespread use. A similar MS/MS fragmentation technique called electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) has been developed which works well in cheaper ion trap mass spectrometers [93,94]. ETD uses radical anions rather than free electrons to transfer an electron to a protonated peptide and cleaves randomly along the peptide backbone while preserving the side chains, O-GlcNAc and other peptide modifications. This technique only works well for higher charge state ions (z > 2). However compared to CID, ETD renders more efficient fragmentation of longer peptides or even whole proteins, which makes this technique important for the proteomic analysis of O-GlcNAc modification. Recent applications of the ETD technique include the site mapping of O-GlcNAc on IRS-1 [95], Forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) [14], and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) [96]. By combining ETD MS/MS with enrichment methods, a number of O-GlcNAc sites on diverse proteins have been mapped [97].As described above, the dynamic cycling of O-GlcNAc is sensitive to the cellular stimuli and the deregulated O-GlcNAc level is associated with several disease states. Therefore, quantitative analyses of O-GlcNAc levels on different proteins or at different states are necessary to understand the functional roles of O-GlcNAc in the specific cellular events at the molecular level.Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is an MS-based technique that detects differences in protein abundance among samples using stable (non-radioactive) heavy isotope labeling [97,98,99] and has become popular as a quantitative proteomic method. In this approach, proteins are metabolically labeled by culturing cells in media containing normal and heavy isotope amino acids. Metabolic incorporation of the amino acids into the proteins results in a mass shift that can be detected by a mass spectrometer. For example, two populations of cells are differentially incubated with light medium containing normal arginine (Arg-0) or heavy medium containing arginine labeled with six carbon-13 atoms (13C) (Arg-6) instead of normal carbon-12 (12C). All of the heavy arginine-containing peptides are 6 Da heavier than their normal counterparts. When both samples are mixed, pairs of chemically identical peptides of different stable-isotope composition are differentiated and the ratio of peak intensities in the mass spectrum reflects the relative protein abundance. The SILAC methodology has been used to test the effect of glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibition on quantitative O-GlcNAc modification changes in COS7 cells [97]. Another cell culture labeling application of SILAC to study O-GlcNAc quantitatively was reported by Wells, et al. [98]. In this application, isotopically labeled glutamine (15N-Gln) was used to metabolically label cellular aminosugars such as GlcNAc, GalNAc, and sialic aicd with heavy nitrogen which enables differentiation of levels in different samples. The major disadvantages of SILAC include the high cost of the isotope-containing amino acids and its inability to study the O-GlcNAc modification of post-mitotic neurons or tissue samples because it requires multiple cell divisions for isotope incorporation.Similar MS/MS spectrometry-based isobaric labeling strategies have been introduced for quantitative analysis of O-GlcNAc modification [102,103,104]. These strategies use isobaric labeling of peptides from different samples/treatments with different tags that consist of the mass reporter, mass balance, and peptide reactive regions. Lighter reporter regions are combined with heavier mass balance regions, such that the entire tag attached to the peptide adds the same mass shift. Therefore, after mixing, in MS1, (Ed- why the superscript when you have no notes?) the peptides appear as a single precursor. However, during MS2 the peptides are cleaved to produce sequence-specific fragment ions, which help to determine the peptide sequence as well as the different m/z reporter ions that provide quantitative information regarding the relative amount of the peptide in the samples. There are two types of isobaric tags: Tandem mass tags (TMT) [102,103] and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) [104]. Recently, a similar peptide labeling method termed as quantitative isotopic and chemoenzymatic tagging (QUIC-tag) has been introduced. This method combines chemoenzymatic tagging of O-GlcNAc proteins with a stable isotopic labeling strategy [105]. In this method, O-GlcNAc proteins from two different cell states (for example, stimulated versus unstimulated, diseased versus normal) are chemoenzymatically labeled, proteolyzed and differentially labeled with ‘light’ or ‘heavy’ isotopes via a modified dimethyl labeling method. The dimethyl labeling strategy uses either formaldehyde/NaCNBH3 or deuterated formaldehyde/NaCNBD3 to incorporate dimethyl or deuterated dimethyl into N-terminal amines and ε-amino groups of lysine residues by reductive amination. This creates mass differences of 6 × n between the peptides from the two cell populations, where n is the number of primary amine groups in the peptide. The resulting mixtures are combined, and O-GlcNAc peptides of interest are specifically enriched by affinity chromatography for selective quantification by LC-MS. The relative level of O-GlcNAc modification in the two cellular states is identified by calculation of the chromatographic peak area determined by the MS response to each eluting glycosylated pair of peptide ions (Figure 6). Using the QUIC-tag approach, several stimulation effects, including OGA inhibition on the dynamic change of O-GlcNAc in the brain, have been examined [106].Quantitative isotopic and chemoenzymatic tagging (QUIC-tag) strategy.Phosphorylation has long been considered a major regulatory mechanism in cellular processes. Aided by the various rapid and efficient strategies and the novel mass spectrometric techniques for O-GlcNAc proteome, nearly one thousand O-GlcNAc modified proteins have been identified and the number of identified O-GlcNAc sites has been greatly increased (for O-GlcNAc proteome information, see dbOGAP: Database of O-GlcNAcylated Proteins and Sites, http://cbsb.lombardi.georgetown.edu/hulab/OGAP.html). Many of these identified O-GlcNAcylated proteins are important regulatory proteins in cellular events, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation is another major regulator of cellular signaling. Aided by recent advances in our ability to detect and quantitate the PTMs it is now known that the crosstalk between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation exists at the modification site level and that the cycling dynamics of these two PTMs at the protein level are differentially regulated. For instance, phosphorylation of Sp1 transcriptional factor gradually rises to reach a peak around 4 h after insulin stimulation, whereas O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 rapidly increases to reach a peak at 30 min, followed by a gradual decline, and returns low levels by 4 h after insulin treatment [107]. In order to better understand the modification effect on the protein level, continued efforts on O-GlcNAc proteomic studies, including the quantitative analysis of O-GlcNAc in vivo, should be invested. Once the modification sites of proteins of interest are determined, development of more direct research tools, such as site-specific O-GlcNAc antibodies, will be very helpful to progress our understanding of the interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, and thereby significantly expand our view of signal transduction.The control of O-GlcNAc modifications of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins provides a means of influencing numerous cellular events and the potential to manage various human diseases. An increasing awareness in the importance of the apparent functional interplay between O-GlcNAc and O-phosphate has prompted chemists/biochemists to develop useful tools to aid the O-GlcNAc modification. There are now several useful chemical and biochemical means available for the manipulation of the O-GlcNAc in culture cells or in living organism.O-GlcNAc cycling involves only two enzymes: OGT [9,10,11] and OGA [12,13]. Therefore, selective and potent manipulation of O-GlcNAc in cells can be achieved by manipulation of these two enzymes’ activities. Small-molecule inhibitors of kinases have proven invaluable for studying the physiological roles of phosphorylation [108]. Cell permeable inhibitors provide several benefits over genetic methods in that there is no need for transfection reagents or viral infection, which renders this method especially useful in cells that are not efficiently transfected. Additionally, cells can be easily monitored according to the dose and time dependent manner and the reversibility of any effects on cells can be observed by removing inhibitors. The design and development of enzyme-specific inhibitors is based on a mechanistic understanding combined with the structural information of the enzyme catalytic sites. Structural and mechanistic studies of these enzymes can begin with the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZY) classification [109,110,111,112] because this classification is built on the basis of the amino-acid sequence similarities of the catalytic domains of enzymes and provides the structural and mechanistic insight on the enzymes of interest from the structurally or mechanistically known enzymes of other organisms in the same family. OGA and OGT are classified in CAZY families GH84 and GT41, respectively. As the first step toward the development of these small-molecule modulators, efficient screening methods for enzymes’ activity must be developed. This review discusses several assay methods that have been developed for the monitoring of enzymes’ activities and/or the screening of the compound libraries to discover potent inhibitors of the enzymes, and the significant contributions of these chemical tools to the evolution of our knowledge about the O-GlcNAc enzymes and their functional roles.OGA is a neutral hexosaminidase and takes the D-GlcNAc β-linked to Ser/Thr and liberates, through hydrolysis, β-D-GlcNAc giving net retention of anomeric configuration [12,13]. Neitherα-linked GlcNAc nor GalNAc is hydrolyzed by OGA. OGA and meninginoma expressed antigen 5 (MGEA5) were shown to be encoded by the same gene [113,114]. OGA has been mapped to chromosome 10q24.1-q24.3, which is a region associated with Alzheimer’s disease. The OGA gene is also implicated with the development of type II diabetes since single nucleotide polymorphism in the MGEA5 gene has been linked to the occurrence of type II diabetes in a Mexican population [115]. The OGA sequence is highly conserved in eukaryotic species, especially in mammals, but absent in prokaryotes and yeast [13]. The OGA gene encodes two alternatively spliced isoforms of OGA (Figure 7). The full length OGA is a 916 amino acid protein (103 kDa) which consists of the catalytic N-terminal domain and the putative acetyl transferase C-terminal domain linked through a highly disordered middle region of 150 amino acids [114,116,117]. Although the C-terminal domain of mouse OGA has been reported to have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity [118], more recent efforts have failed to support these findings [119]. The other isoform is a 677 amino acid protein that lacks the C-terminal third of the full-length OGA but contains an additional 15 amino acid residues [13,116,120]. According to cell fractionation studies, full length OGA predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm while the short OGA isoform resides in the nucleus [13,116,120].Human OGA isoforms.The conventional in vitro assay for measuring OGA activity uses a chromogenic substrate, p-nitrophenyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranoside (PNP-GlcNAc) [12], which is also used as a substrate for lysosomal hexosaminidases that are functionally related to OGA. Enzymatic activity is monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 400 nm of a p-nitrophenolate ion that is enzymatically hydrolyzed from PNP-GlcNAc [12,121] (Figure 8a). However, this assay is relatively insensitive because the substrate undergoes only a modest change in absorbance upon cleavage and the enzymatic activity of short OGA is not detectable with PNP-GlcNAc. Recently, more sensitive assay methods involving fluorescence have been introduced to monitor OGA activity.OGA activity assays using a chromogenic PNP-GlcNAc substrate (a) and two fluorogenic substrates (b).The two fluorogenic substrates currently being used for in vitro OGA activity assay are4-methylumbellifery 2-deoxy-2-N-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (MU-GlcNAc) [38] and fluorescein di(N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide) (FDGlcNAc) [41] (Figure 8b). MU-GlcNAc is hydrolyzed by the action of OGA to liberate 4-methylumbelliferon and the progress of enzyme reaction is determined by fluorescence measurements. Using this substrate and its derivatives, Macauley et al. have performed the first systematic study on the catalytic mechanism of OGA. In their mechanistic study, a series of substrates bearing different numbers of fluorine atoms substituted at the methyl group of the N-acetyl moiety was synthesized and examined to determine the effect of this substitution on the rate of catalysis [38]. Based on the decreased rate of OGA’s catalytic reaction with increasing number of fluorine substitutions decreased and the fact that substitution of electronegative fluorine atoms lowers the basicity of the carbonyl group and decreases the nucleophilicity of carbonyl oxygen, it has been proposed that OGA uses a substrate participation mechanism involving the acetamido group acting as a nucleophile. Such a trend was also observed for the human lysosomal hexosaminidases that have a catalytic mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis (Figure 9). However, the negative effect of the fluorine substitutions on the rate of enzymatic reaction is larger in lysosomal hexosaminidases than in OGA, which suggests that there is a steric factor difference in the catalytic center between them [38]. Thus, OGA is thought to have a relatively deep active site architecture that can tolerate some extension of the N-acetyl moiety of the substrate, whereas lysosomal enzymes have a shallow active pocket that does not allow more sterically hindered modification of O-GlcNAc. The key catalytic residues of human OGA have been suggested to be Asp174 and Asp175 [39]. Subsequent crystallographic studies of bacterial OGA homologues (Clostridium perfringens
CpGH84 [122,123] and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron
BtGH84) [124] have provided further support for this “substrate-assisted” catalytic mechanism and for the structural difference of the active site architecture between OGA and lysosomal hexosaminidases. In addition, these kinetic and structural studies have also defined Asp174 and Asp175 as two general acid/base catalytic residues within the human OGA.OGA uses the substrate-assisted catalytic hydrolysis mechanism (A→[B]‡→C→D).Although, the short and long OGA isoforms contain the identical N-terminal catalytic sites, no activity had been detected for several years in the short isoform in vitro with PUGNAc as an enzyme substrate. However, the use of a fluorogenic substrate, FDGlcNAc, revealed that both isoforms are active in vitro [41]. The FDGlcNAc substrate is non-fluorescent but becomes fluorescent when enzymatically hydrolyzed due to the generation of fluorescent, fluorescein-conjugated mono-GlcNAc (FMGlcNAc). Due to the greatly enhanced sensitivity of the assay, as well as the increased affinity of FDGlcNAc for the enzyme, the catalytic activity of short OGA isoform has been detected. Additionally, the short OGA has been shown to be active against cellular extracts, but at a much lower rate than the long isoform [41]. These in vitro data may suggest that the C-terminus of OGA is important for full enzymatic activity although the catalytic site of OGA lies in the N-terminus. Caspase-3, a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease (caspase) family that and serves as the “executioner protease” in apoptosis, cleaves the middle region of OGA in vitro and during apoptosis in vivo [119,120]. Cleavage of OGA by caspase-3 does not affect O-GlcNAc hydrolyzing catalytic activity. OGA activity is absent if the N-terminal region alone is overexpressed in cells, but fully present if this region is co-overexpressed with the C-terminal region. This observation further supports the proposal that an interaction between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains may be required for the optimal OGA activity. However, this does not exclude the possibility that the short OGA is as active as the long form in vivo, because there may be other factors, such as PTMs or binding adaptor proteins. The three key questions that remain unanswered are the nature of the functional role of the short OGA, the method by which O-GlcNAc cycling is regulated within the cell, and the function of the C-terminal domain.The second generation of an FDGlcNAc derivative (1 in Figure 10) that is specific for OGA, but not for the functionally related lysosomal enzymes, has been developed [37] based on the structural insights on the catalytic center architectures of the enzymes. The main advantage of this OGA-specific fluorogenic substrate is its ability to enable the differential detection of OGA’s activity from that of other endogenous hexosaminidases, which facilitates the high-throughput analysis of OGA within cellular assays and serves as an imaging agent for the in vivo OGA analysis.The structures of OGA-specific pentanamide FDGlcNAc substrate 1 analogueand OGAinhibitors discussed in the text.Compounds 2,3,8,9 are nonspecific OGA inhibitors, while 4–7 are OGA-specific inhibitors.These aforementioned sensitive fluorogenic substrates have enabled the high-throughput analysis of enzyme activity, including inhibitor screening, using a multiwall plate format. The availability of rapid enzyme assays and insights on the mechanism and structure of OGA have facilitated the design of selective OGA inhibitors (more in reviews [43,44]). Briefly, previously known non-selective OGA inhibitors,O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glycopyranosylidene)-amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc, 2) [13,125] and GlcNAc-thiazoline, 3 [38,126], have been modified to have the extended N-alkyl chains(Butyl-PUGNAc 4 and NButGT 5), which can sit in the OGA’s active pocket but not in the more enclosed pocket of human HexA and B [37,38]. Another selective but still very potent inhibitor, “ThiametG” (6), has also been developed [127]. ThiametG is related to N-butyl thiazoline but contains an isothiourea moiety that renders a more favorable electrostatic interaction with the catalytic residue. In a similar vein, Dorfmueller and co-workers have developed a selective inhibitor, GlcNAcstatin (7) [40,128], which bears the identical tetrahydroimidazopyridine scaffold as the non-selective OGA inhibitor “Nagstatin”/sugar imidazole derivatives (8,9) [129,130,131], but contains a bulky isobutanamido moiety at C2 that offers selectivity for OGA.As stated earlier, OGT transfers GlcNAc from α-linked UDP-GlcNAc to the hydroxyls of serine and threonine residues to form the β-linked O-glycosyl proteins [9,10,11]. OGT is classified as a family GT41 in the CAZY database [110]. OGT has numerous protein targets. To date, OGT has been found to glycosylate almost one thousand substrates and it is encoded by a single highly conserved gene in animals [10,13,132]. OGT is found in many organisms, from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans, and shares very high homology among species. The human OGT gene resides on the X chromosome (Xq13.1), which is a region associated with Parkinson’s disease [133,134]. Knockout studies have shown that OGT is required for the viability of embryonic stem cells and the loss of O-GlcNAc results in concomitant loss of cell function and eventually cell death [135]. However, OGT knockout in C. elegans does not lead to the death of the worm but produces profound metabolic changes, such as insulin resistance and carbohydrate storage [136]. For humans, there are three isoforms of OGT from alternative splicing, all of which consist of two distinct N-terminal and C-terminaldomains [10,134,137,138] (Figure 11). The N-terminal domain contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are involved in protein-protein interaction. TPR motifs are highly conserved 34-amino acid repeats that are arranged as two α-helices that pack together to form a right handed super-helix with a large groove available for protein and ligand binding [139,140]. In contrast, the C-terminal domain is the catalytic domain that is identical in all three isoforms and has homology to glycogen phosphorylase [24,32,33,141]. Each OGT isoform has a unique N-terminus with different numbers of TPRs at the N-terminus. This unique N-terminus of each isoform is thought to contribute to their sub-cellular localization. Expression of each OGT isoform varies among different cell types and different tissues, suggesting that each isoform may have distinct functions and respond differently to cellular signaling depending on its tissue distribution [10,142]. The longest isoform has 11.5 TPR motifs, is found in the nucleus and cytoplasm (ncOGT; 116-kD), and is known to be associated with transcriptional repression [143], proteasomal inhibition [144,145], and stress tolerance [146]. The next longest isoform produces an N-terminal domain that contains a unique mitochondrial targeting sequence, followed by a membrane-spanning α-helix that directs the enzyme to the inner leaflet of the mitochondrial membrane [138]. This mitochondrial OGT (mOGT; 103-kDa) has 9.5 TPRs and may be associated with the activation of transcription factor Sp1 by mitochondrial superoxide overproduction [147]. The shortest form of OGT (sOGT; 70-kDa) contains 2.5 TPRs and similar to ncOGT is found in the nucleus and cytoplasm. sOGT is thought to have an anti-apoptotic function [148]. Each OGT isoform has been shown to have different peptide and protein preferences in vitro [142,149]. In addition, by the sequential removal of TPR segments to explore the roles of the TPR domain length in OGT substrate recognition, it has been suggested that OGT uses different TPR motifs to recognize specific protein substrates and that the substrate recognition is compromised by deletion; however, no catalytic activity is affected [132,150].Human OGT isoforms.The first structural insights into the architecture of OGT were provided by the crystal structure of the TPR domain of human ncOGT by Jinek et al. in 2004 [151]. ncOGT exists as a homo-dimer with each monomer consisting of 23 anti-parallel α-helices that form a right-handed superhelix. This TPR structure shows an extended superhelical architecture in which the inner surface of the helix is lined with several conserved asparagine residues. This extended superhelical structure and the presence of the asparagine ladder resembles the armadillo repeats found in the structures of importin α [152] and β-catenin [153], which are involved in the recognition of nuclear localization signaling peptides. This structural similarity suggests that the considerable length of the TPR motifs provides an extensive scaffold that may accommodate many protein partners in many different orientations and binding modes, thereby explaining the absence of an explicit primary sequence motif for the O-GlcNAc modification.Aided by the high-throughput enzymatic assays available for OGA, the design of potent and selective inhibitors for OGA has flourished in recent years, as described above. However, the same cannot be said for OGT due to the complexity and inconvenience inherent in OGT assays. The lack of a rapid and simple method for continuously monitoring OGT activity has impeded the efficient discovery of potent OGT inhibitors. A conventional in vitro OGT activity assay [132] uses a radiolabeled sugar donor substrate such as UDP-[14C]-GlcNAc. In this method, the OGT activity is measured by quantitating radiolabeled GlcNAc incorporation into the protein substrate such as Nup62, a nuclear pore protein known to have multiple O-GlcNAc sites. However, this method involves a tedious procedure, high cost, and inevitable radiochemical waste, which render it unamenable for rapid analysis. To date, several non-radiometric assay strategies have been developed for monitoring OGT activity.The chemosensor-based glycosyltransferase assay (Figure 12a) has been introduced for high-throughput activity assay for a wide range of glycosyltransferases by the Hamachi group [154]. In this strategy, a glycosylated nucleotide such as UDP-glycoside is converted into the corresponding nucleotide by the action of a glycosyltransferase, and the amount of liberated nucleotide increases as the reaction proceeds. Since the nucleotide formation is equivalent to the progress of the glycosyl transfer reaction, sensing the generated nucleotide provides a means for identifying the progress of the enzyme reaction. This method utilizes an artificial fluorescent chemosensor that can allow for the distinction between a free nucleotide that is a product of the enzyme reaction and its corresponding glycosylated ones. The fluorescent chemosensor used in this strategy is a binuclear zinc complex-based, fluorescent probe (Figure 12a). This zinc-coordinated fluorescent probe binds to the free UDP more tightly than to the UDP-sugar. Therefore, the stronger binding multicomplex composed of the fluorescent probe and UDP produces a higher fluorescence intensity than the weaker binding multicomplex formed between the probe and the corresponding UDP-glycoside. The increase in fluorescence upon the coordination of the probe to UDP is considered the consequence of the suppression of photo-induced electron transfer quenching resulting from the phosphate-assisted coordination of the second Zn2+ atom. By measuring the difference in fluorescence intensity arising from the different binding affinity of this probe between the reactant (UDP-Gal) and the product (UDP), it is possible to calculate the enzyme activity. However, when this method is applied for the enzyme activity, special attention should be paid to the selection of the reaction system because the presence of any species in the reaction system that strongly binds to the chemosensor will significantly decrease the reaction sensitivity. For example, the phosphate or citrate buffers that are often used in enzymatic reaction buffers shouldn’t be used in this assay. Furthermore, the enzyme assayed should be purified, as otherwise some other substances in the cell lysates may quench or preferentially bind to the chemosensor, thereby harming the reaction sensitivity. In addition, the relative differences in the fluorescence intensity among the chemosensor probe, UDP and UDP-glycosides are relatively moderate.Strategies developed for OGT activity assay and high-throughput screening:(a)chemosensor-based glycosyltransferaseassayand (b) ligand displacement OGT assay.A ligand displacement OGT assay (Figure 12b) [155,156] using fluorescent UDP-GlcNAc analogues and an active sOGT enzyme for the purpose of rapid screening of OGT inhibitors has been introduced by Walker et al. This strategy involves fluorescence anisotropy (fluorescence polarization), based on the idea that a fluorophore excited by polarized light will also emit polarized light. However, if a molecule is moving, it will emit the light at a different direction from the incident light and tend to “scramble” the polarization of the light. This “scrambling” effect is large when fluorophores are freely tumbling in solution but reduced when the tumbling rate of the fluorophores decreases. This method allows for the measurement of the protein interactions where one of the interacting partners is fused to a fluorophore. Binding of the fluorophore-containing molecule to an interacting protein leads to the formation of a larger and more stable complex that tumbles more slowly, in turn reducing the “scrambling” effect and increasing the polarization of the emitted light. In the fluorescent-based substrate displacement OGT assay, the binding of the fluorescent UDP-GlcNAc analogue to sOGT increases the anisotropy of this substrate analogue compared to its unbound state. Therefore, the amount of polarization observed is proportional to the amount of sOGT complex formed, which is itself proportional to the concentration of its binding to the sOGT partner. By measuring the difference in fluorescence polarization between the bound and unbound states of the substrate as a function of sOGT concentration, its dissociation constant or binding constant (~1.3 μM) was determined [156]. The displacement of this fluorescent analogue bound to sOGT by other non-fluorescent molecules decreases the fluorescence polarization. Therefore, addition of natural UDP-GlcNAc or UDP to apre-equilibrated mixture of sOGT and the fluorescent-labeled UDP-GlcNAc analogue replaces the fluorescent-labeled substrate from sOGT, thereby reducing the fluorescence polarization. The dissociation constants of the natural UDP-GlcNAc substance and the fluorescent-labeled UDP-GlcNAc analogue are similar (~1.5 μM for UDP-GlcNAc and ~1.3 μM for labeled UDP-GlcNAc analogue), implying that the fluorophore appendix on the substrate does not affect its binding onto the sOGT enzyme [156].Using this strategy, a library of compounds has been screened and three structurally unrelated OGT inhibitors with the micromolar range inhibition (10–12 in Figure 13) have been discovered. If these in vitro OGT inhibitors are able to reduce O-GlcNAc modification in cells, they can be useful tools to study the physiological role of O-GlcNAc. However, it has not been reported yet whether they are also active in vivo or not. Although this method allows for the rapid screening of the libraries of compounds, it does not provide the direct measurement of the glycosyl transferase activity of OGT, therefore necessitating other robust OGT activity assays to validate the positive hit compounds for OGT inhibition.Structures of in vitro OGT inhibitors.Later, Walker et al. presented another assay strategy called the protease-protection assay, which enables the monitoring of the glycosyl transferase activity of the enzyme by measuring the protease activity (Figure 14a) [157]. This assay exploits the “fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)” phenomenon of a FRET pair tethered at each end of a peptide substrate. The FRET phenomenon begins when a fluorescent donor molecule absorbs the energy in a proper wavelength and is converted from its ground state So to an excited singlet state, S1*, and then to the relaxed singlet state, S1, by dissipating some of the absorbed energy. If there is no acceptor fluorophore near the donor, the relaxed singlet state (S1) of the donor returns to its ground energy state (So) by emitting the remaining light energy at a longer wavelength in the form of specific fluorescence. However, if an acceptor fluorophore is present in the proximal distance to the donor, the energy emitted from the donor can be transferred into the acceptor fluorophore to activate the acceptor. Then the excited acceptor finally emits energy at a new wavelength through the same process described above. In order to accept the donor energy by a FRET acceptor, two criteria must simultaneously be satisfied: compatibility and proximity. In order to be a compatible acceptor its absorbance spectrum must overlap the emission spectrum of the donor molecule. If a compatible acceptor is close enough to the donor molecule for the energy to excite it, that molecule is suitable as a FRET acceptor (Figure 14b). In recent years, fluorescent acceptor molecules have been replaced with quencher molecules. Quenchers are chemically related to fluorophore acceptors but instead of emitting absorbed fluorescence resonance energy in the form of light, they transform the light energy to heat and hence remain dark. Dual-labeled constructs composed of fluorophore donor and quencher acceptor have no background fluorescence and thus greatly simplify many fluorescence-based assays. The substrate constructs Walker et al. employed for measuring OGT activity in their assay were specially designed peptide substrates with a fluorescein donor at one terminus and a quencher or fluorescent acceptor molecule at the other terminus. Their strategy is based on the observation that the cleavage of glycosylated proteins/peptides by protease is more difficult than that of non-glycosylated ones. The assay begins with O-GlcNAcylation of the specially designed peptide substrate labeled with a FRET pair by OGT. The O-GlcNAc-modified peptide is then treated with a protease that acts differentially on the glycosylated and the non-glycosylated peptides. The degree of peptide glycosylation, which is closely related to the amount of proteolysis, is determined by measuring the resulting FRET signal after proteolysis (Figure 14a). The OGT activity in this strategy is indirectly determined. If the presence of any factor affects the protease activity, the negative compounds can be judged as the positive hits. Therefore, other methods are required to validate this assay result. Using this method combined with the conventional radiolabeling OGT assay, three additional new OGT inhibitors (13–15 in Figure 13) with a micromolar IC50 range (0.9 ~ 20 μM) have been discovered [157], but again, their use as OGT inhibitors in vivo has not yet been reported.(a) Protease-protection assay: protease preferentially cleaves less sterically hindered unglycosylated peptide compared to the glycosylated peptide; and (b) the “FRET” phenomenon.For a slightly different purpose, Bertozzi et al. has introduced a high-throughput method termed as the azido-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (azido-ELISA) [158]. This method has been developed for the interrogation of OGT’s substrate specificity and involves Staudinger ligation with azido-labeled substrate and a phosphine derivative. The assay uses an unnatural sugar donor, UDP-GlcNAz for OGT, to label the biotinylated peptide substrates that are captured onto avidin-coated 96-well plates, followed by chemoselective reaction with phosphine-FLAG. This FLAG-labeled epitope is then used for the colorimetric readout of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) activity by using the HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody. This HRP activity readout data determines the relative OGT activity toward each peptide substrate. This approach facilitates the measurement of the OGT activity toward peptide substrates and the screening of various molecules for the OGT inhibitors. However, the whole process involves many reaction steps, is time consuming and increases the overall experimental errors. The results obtained from this method using the systematic variation of amino acids in the sequence of model peptide substrates suggest a modest preference of side-chains on both sides of the modification site, although OGT appears to have no evident primary sequence pattern of peptides to recognize. Therefore, there may be specific structural determinants underlying these substrate sequence preferences. Significant insights into the architecture of OGT have been provided by the X-ray structure of a bacterial OGT homolog, Xanthomonas campestris OGT, (XcOGT) [159,160]. XcOGT contains 5.5 TPRs followed by the GT domains that adopt the GT-B fold. The generic GT-B fold [112,161] consists of two β/α/β “Rossman” fold domains [catalytic domain I (CD-I) and catalytic domain II (CD-2)]. N-terminal CD-I binds the acceptor molecule while the C-terminal CD-II binds the nucleotide-sugar donor. Catalysis occurs at the interface of these two domains, carrying with the global domain conformational changes. The OGT enzyme is considered to operate via an inverting SN2-like reaction mechanism where the enzyme scaffold provides a general base that activates the incoming protein/peptide nucleophile (OH group of Ser/Thr) for the displacement of the leaving group (UDP portion of the donor) in a concerted manner.As aforementioned, aided by several useful, high-throughput, enzymatic assays and mechanistic and structural insights for OGA, several potent and selective OGA inhibitors have been developed and applied. The use of small-molecule OGA inhibitors has greatly assisted in the evolution of concepts about the roles of O-GlcNAc. In the vast majority of early studies of O-GlcNAc, O-GlcNAc was elevated by treatment of cells with inhibitors such as streptozotocin (STZ) [162] and PUGNAc [125]. These elevated O-GlcNAc levels have been linked to the development of insulin resistance (for examples with STZ see Ref. [163,164,165], and for PUGNAc see References [32,166]). Cell treatment with STZ causes apoptosis and pancreatic β-cell death [164,165,166,167,168]. A great body of data ascribes the apoptosis-inducing effect of STZ to the free radical NO production from the breakdown of the nitrosomoiety [169,170], but not to the selective inhibition of OGA. This reasoning is based on the fact that both PUGNAc and STZ cause increases in cellular O-GlcNAc levels, but only STZ causes celldeath [171,172]. PUGNAc is a very potent inhibitor of OGA, but it also strongly inhibits the human lysosomal enzymes, Hex A and B, which increases the ganglioside levels that could impact insulin resistance [173]. Due to the off-target effects, both STZ and PUGNAc may not be suitable chemical probes for the studies of OGA and O-GlcNAc. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a nonspecific inhibitor, PUGNAc, causes insulin resistance, whereas treatment of the cells with different OGA-specific inhibitors, show no effect on insulin desensitization [174,175]. In consistence with these results, recently, Vocadlo et al. have showed that treatment of rodents with a OGA-specific inhibitor does not cause insulin resistance although O-GlcNAc increases [176]. The link between the elevated O-GlcNAc level and insulin resistance in different cell lines and in different organisms should be thoroughly examined with these more specific chemical tools. Therefore, the application of these specific chemical tools promises exciting advances in this field.In contrast to the availability of several useful specific OGA inhibitors, potent and selective OGT inhibitors are almost unknown. Clearly, intensive and continuous efforts focused on the development of simple and high-throughput OGT enzymatic assays and the design of the structure-inspired, OGT-specific inhibitors are essential to advance our understanding of the functional roles of OGT and O-GlcNAc cycling.O-GlcNAcylation participates in many important cellular processes via its extensive and dynamic interplay with phosphorylation [29,30,35,36]. Consequently, dysregulation of the balance between these two modifications has been implicated in several diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. Over the past several years, various chemical tools have been rapidly exploited to expand our understanding of the biological roles played by O-GlcNAc and have proven invaluable in elucidating our knowledge about cellular signaling. Nevertheless, important questions remain to be answered; one of the key questions is how OGT and OGA target so many substrates while retaining substrate specificity. Although it is now known that the substrate specificities of these enzymes can be determined, in part, by their transient interactions with many binding partners to form various substrate specific holoenzymes, an enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which they are regulated will remain a key focus for future research. Continuing efforts directed at enhancing the chemical arsenal with more direct and efficient chemical tools, such as the development of high-throughput yet robust OGT assays and isoform-specific OGA and OGT inhibitors, will lead to new discoveries about O-GlcNAcylation. In addition, the generation of site-specific O-GlcNAc antibodies and the elucidation of the enzymes’ crystal structures will be the subjects of future research to expand our understanding about the roles of O-GlcNAc. All of these tools will provide deeper insights into the cell signaling paradigm.This work was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (2010-0028040)."
20490603,β-Glucosidases.,True,"β-Glucosidases (3.2.1.21) are found in all domains of living organisms, where they play essential roles in the removal of nonreducing terminal glucosyl residues from saccharides and glycosides. β-Glucosidases function in glycolipid and exogenous glycoside metabolism in animals, defense, cell wall lignification, cell wall β-glucan turnover, phytohormone activation, and release of aromatic compounds in plants, and biomass conversion in microorganisms. These functions lead to many agricultural and industrial applications. β-Glucosidases have been classified into glycoside hydrolase (GH) families GH1, GH3, GH5, GH9, and GH30, based on their amino acid sequences, while other β-glucosidases remain to be classified. The GH1, GH5, and GH30 β-glucosidases fall in GH Clan A, which consists of proteins with (β/α)(8)-barrel structures. In contrast, the active site of GH3 enzymes comprises two domains, while GH9 enzymes have (α/α)(6) barrel structures. The mechanism by which GH1 enzymes recognize and hydrolyze substrates with different specificities remains an area of intense study."
21057783,Insights into the phylogeny and metabolic potential of a primary tropical peat swamp forest microbial community by metagenomic analysis.,True,"A primary tropical peat swamp forest is a unique ecosystem characterized by long-term accumulation of plant biomass under high humidity and acidic water-logged conditions, and is regarded as an important terrestrial carbon sink in the biosphere. In this study, the microbial community in the surface peat layer in Pru Toh Daeng, a primary tropical peat swamp forest, was studied for its phylogenetic diversity and metabolic potential using direct shotgun pyrosequencing of environmental DNA, together with analysis of 16S rRNA gene library and key metabolic genes. The community was dominated by aerobic microbes together with a significant number of facultative and anaerobic microbial taxa. Acidobacteria and diverse Proteobacteria (mainly Alphaproteobacteria) constituted the major phylogenetic groups, with minor representation of archaea and eukaryotic microbes. Based on comparative pyrosequencing dataset analysis, the microbial community showed high metabolic versatility of plant polysaccharide decomposition. A variety of glycosyl hydrolases targeting lignocellulosic and starch-based polysaccharides from diverse bacterial phyla were annotated, originating mostly from Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria together with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae/Verrucomicrobia, and Actinobacteria, suggesting the key role of these microbes in plant biomass degradation. Pyrosequencing dataset annotation and direct mcrA gene analysis indicated the presence of methanogenic archaea clustering in the order Methanomicrobiales, suggesting the potential on partial carbon flux from biomass degradation through methanogenesis. The insights on the peat swamp microbial assemblage thus provide a valuable approach for further study on biogeochemical processes in this unique ecosystem."
21365277,"Toward the functional analysis of uncultivable, symbiotic microorganisms in the termite gut.",True,"Termites thrive on dead plant matters with the aid of microorganisms resident in their gut. The gut microbiota comprises protists (single-celled eukaryotes), bacteria, and archaea, most of which are unique to the termite gut ecosystem. Although this symbiosis has long been intriguing researchers of both basic and applied sciences, its detailed mechanism remains unclear due to the enormous complexity and the unculturability of the microbiota. In the effort to overcome the difficulty, recent advances in omics, such as metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics have gradually unveiled the black box of this symbiotic system. Genomics targeting a single species of the unculturable microbial members has also provided a great progress in the understanding of the symbiotic interrelationships among the gut microorganisms. In this review, the symbiotic system organized by wood-feeding termites and their gut microorganisms is outlined, focusing on the recent achievement in omics studies of this multilayered symbiotic system."
